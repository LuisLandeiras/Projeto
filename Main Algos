Readability Metrics:
These metrics assess the readability of text, considering factors such as sentence length, word complexity, and overall text structure. Common metrics include Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, Coleman-Liau Index, and Automated Readability Index (ARI).
-Flesch Reading Ease; X
-Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level; X
-Gunning Fog Index;
-Coleman-Liau Index; X
-ARI. X

Sentiment Analysis X

Text Similarity:
Text similarity algorithms assess how similar two or more pieces of text are. Techniques such as Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Similarity, and Levenshtein Distance can be used to measure the similarity between texts.
-Cosine Similarity; X
-Jaccard Similarity;
-Levenshtein Distance.

Named Entity Recognition (NER):
NER algorithms identify and classify named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) mentioned in the text. spaCy's NER capabilities are quite advanced and can be used for this purpose.

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:
POS tagging assigns a grammatical category to each word in the text, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This can be useful for assessing the grammatical structure and complexity of the text.

Dependency Parsing:
Dependency parsing analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences to determine the relationships between words. It can be useful for assessing the coherence and syntactic complexity of the text.

Topic Modeling:
Topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can be used to identify the underlying topics or themes in a corpus of text. This can help assess the relevance and coherence of the text.
-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);
-Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

Text Classification:
Text classification algorithms categorize text into predefined classes or categories. This can be useful for tasks such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, or topic classification.
