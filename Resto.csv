"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Hank Thompson sat in his office when Gore warrior came to pay him a visit since Hank was not really a warlock he never was able to vanquish him. 'Hi can I help you? 'Hank asked the huge man.  'I think it's the other way around, I think I can help you because you have been wronged by a woman you once knew as Cheyenne.' He said sitting down in the chair in front of the desk with a smile wearing all black.  'I am sorry I don't recall any woman by the name of Cheyenne.' He told Gore warrior.  'Let me refresh your memory for you.' he told him as his eyes glowed restoring the memory of his life with Cheyenne.  With a look of utter disbelief. 'Mystics Shadow.' He said slowly looking at the man as he knew as Gore warrior. 'You, I vanquished you.' He said standing up from the desk.  'They allowed you to become one of them, and then her and her lover decided it was time for you to go that they no longer needed to use you. they kicked you out reversing any magic you had, any memory of being the High Priest so her and her lover Knight Shadow could marry making him the High Priest. He steals your wife, kid and riches. All I ever did was to pleasure her; she was a freak like the time while you were sleeping she told me to perform oral sex on her. She liked how I got her hot. She convinced you that I took your body so I could impregnate her. I impregnated her with her knowing it was me. She rode me hard that night calling out my name not yours.' He told him seeing the rage in his face.  'That bitch!' Hank yelled looking at Gore warrior. 'Why are you telling me this? Why should I believe you? What do you want out of it?' he asked him looking suspiciously at him.  'Because she dumped me too and you want them all dead like I do, don't you? She made you think you were the father of her daughter when she was sleeping with Knight Shadow the whole time! Mystic caster is his daughter.' he told him knowing he had him now.  'Join us and we will give you powers they could never give you. Between the two of us we can kill your whore wife and her husband who replaced you in every aspect.' He told him watching him as Hank believed him, he always thought the worse of Mystic Shadow when he was angry causing him to hurt her.  'But she died how could she have come back? He asked him remembering her death.  'That was a ploy to get rid of you, because Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow are very much alive.' He told him seeing the anger in Hank's face.  'You have a deal I will join your forces!' Hank told him wanting revenge so bad he could taste it.  Gore warrior stood up hitting him with a lightening bolt in his heart killing him. His head lay back against the chair lifeless; his eyes opened slowly with a bright red glow as he grinned. 'I know how to get the bitch to come to us. We will go to my house and use my bitch that I ended up with, with both of us involved attacking poor weak flat as a board Kathy it will bring my real whore of a wife out. I think its time for her lover and husband have one last fuck before we kill her!' he told Gore warrior as they both laughed. They appeared in the living room of his house while his wife was in the kitchen.  'I am home honey come meet my friend.' He yelled for her smiling.  His wife came out looking at the huge man with Hank, she walked up to him to shake his hand when he grabbed her wrist pulling her up to his body as his eyes began to glow. Feeling fear she looked at Hank his eyes were glowing to just like the man holding her. 'Let me go! Hank please stop him!' she pleaded as Gore warrior ripped off her clothing throwing her on the ground raping her savagely.  When he was done with her Hank grabbed her by the back of her hair throwing her on the ground sodomizing her.  Mystic Shadow got the vision of Gore warrior and Hank going to his house to kill his wife. 'Hank has joined the dark side! He is with Gore warrior their going to kill his wife!' she told Knight Shadow then vanished.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the living room as Hank was raping his wife. Seeing his glowing eyes.' You son of a bitch!' she yelled at him to get his attention to her and off of his wife.  'Mystic Shadow how nice that you wanted to join us.' Gore warrior said grabbing her from behind, putting his hands on her breast as he licked her neck slowly.  'Fuck you!' she said throwing him over her back on to the ground.  'You bitch! You took everything from me!' Hank said rising up off his wife running at Mystic Shadow, his eyes were glowing as his wife watched them attacking the strange woman in white while she lay crying on the ground.  They both grabbed her before she could use her powers on them bringing her to the ground trying to rip her clothes off to rape her. Both Gore warrior and Hank went flying up against the wall from a powerful force. Knight Shadow and Rain caster stood there looking at the creatures from hell with hate and contempt.  'You know something Hank I never did like you, and I don't like you putting your vile hands on my wife!' he told him raising him up in the air as Hank tried to struggle free from Knight Shadow's powers.  Rain caster held Gore warrior frozen in one spot. 'I think its feeding time Knight Shadow.' He said smiling at the ghoulish demon.  Hank was crazed from the demonic forces flowing through his blood. 'She was my wife that you fucked! You got her knocked up with Mystic caster! You two planned on getting me out of the way the whole time! You two were always taking off together, you even sent me the vision of the night you fucked her! I am her husband not you!' he yelled as he could not move as Knight Shadow was a powerful warrior.  'For one thing Hank, I don't fuck my wife, I make love to my wife and we conceived Mystic caster out of love something you know nothing about! You hid behind her making her do all the fighting while you whimpered like a fucking puppy! Reality is Hank you were never married to her; we were wed when she was twenty one years old.' Knight Shadow told him slamming him against another wall as Mystic Shadow tried to comfort Hank's wife Kathy.  'That's for calling her a witch whore!' he told him slamming him up against the ceiling.' This is for all the times you threw that slime of hell hanging in the air over there up in her face constantly!' he said throwing him on the ground at his feet stepping on his throat. ' And this one, last but not least is for all the tears you ever made her shed from the cruelty you ever did to her. So for wishing that we were burnt at the stakes I grant your wish to be delivered to you!' he told him looking at him with a smile of satisfaction on his face.  'I Knight shadow, the true High Priest order this slime to pass hell to the one who eats the evil souls on this demons soul he may dine in to the place where he dwells!' he said stepping back as Hank blew up into flames.  'Tennis anyone?' Rain caster asked as he slammed Gore warrior into the wall.  'I think you mean hand ball.' Knight Shadow told him as he too slammed Gore warrior into the wall leaving the outline of his body on the wall from the force they used. Knight Shadow and Rain caster began to chant together.' 'I Knight shadow, the true High Priest and Rain caster brother to the High Priest order this foul slime to by pass hell going to the one who eat the evil souls, we give him this demons soul so he may dine in to the place where he dwells!' they said stepping back as Gore warrior blew up into flames his demonic cries were loud as he burned.  Mystic Shadow looked at Kathy, she was frightened and finding it hard to believe her husband of twenty five years was a demon. 'She can't stay here; the others will come for her.' She told Knight Shadow holding Kathy's hand.  'One more place at the dinner table.' He said smiling at Kathy all of them vanishing.  They explained to the woman that she would be staying with them where they could protect her from the dark side torturing her for Gore warrior's finale demise. He was one of their highest demons. Kathy was a great help to Mystic caster with the twins, she soon became accustom to the life style of the witches and warlocks. One warrior name Shadow caster who was a powerful warrior, with blond curly hair to his neck line, crystal blue eyes, he was very muscular standing six feet three inches weighing two hundred and thirty pounds, began spending a lot of time helping Kathy with the kids even teaching her how to dodge flying objects since the twins found it funny to slam Mr. bear against your head. Kathy would smile watching the love exchanged between Mystic Shadow and Knight shadow as they would roll around on the living room floor wrestling then kissing each other as new lovers do. Shadow caster went to Rain caster for advice on romancing this beautiful woman.  Rain Caster smiling.' My advice is to take her some where secluded like on a tropical island, both of your attire should be tropical for a picnic lunch and let nature take its course.' He told him patting him on the shoulder.  Shadow Caster took Rain Caster's advice approaching Kathy, he was nervous. 'Kathy I was wondering if you'd go to lunch with me today?' he asked standing in front of her rubbing his hands together.  Kathy smiled at him feeling the same attraction for him.' Yes I would love to go with you for lunch.' She told him standing up from the chair wearing a white sleeveless dress.  Taking her hand they appeared on an island in the tropics, through his magic he changed their attire to tropical bathing suits, a blanket, and a basket full of food with a bottle of white wine. They sat on the blanket eating and laughing, the wine was making Kathy tipsy.  'I have wanted to do something since the first day I saw you.' She told him getting on her knees in front of him where he was sitting.  'What have you wanted to do?' he asked smiling at her.  Kathy leaned over kissing him feeling his arms wrap around her, they fell back wards, their kisses becoming more passionate and intense un aware that it had started raining as he rolled on top of her letting his hands explore her body as well as his tongue, they made passionate love only noticing the storm when they exploded into a climax when a lightening bolt struck near where they were laying.  Looking at each other laughing for they both were startled. 'I guess we should return to the house.' He told her lying on top of her kissing her nose.  From that moment on he slept every night in her room holding her close to his body as they slept UN aware the fairies were giggling sprinkling them with their magical dust for protection as they did to everyone in the entire house. Fairies were always near the children day or night. Knight Shadow felt it was time to move to a new location considering they had been their six months now. Rain caster and Enchantress caster were sent to find a secluded place for them to move to with in the next twenty four hours. The husband and wife team soared through the skies invisible to anything. They found twenty acres of land in Northern Florida in a small town known as Live Oak, Rain Caster and Enchantress caster purchased the property, they then arranged for the lights and water to be installed paying extra for priority status as in yesterday. They purchased a two story log home to be delivered that day since he had already cleared the property using his magic. By the next evening everything was set up since Enchantress Caster living up to her name convinced the water and electrical companies to just place everything there that they would do the rest even showing them her degrees in electrical, plumbing and her builders contractors license. She was able to have the furniture delivered the next morning; it was all red wood and rustic looking furniture. They could not just pop everything into place since they were in a small town where everyone knew everyone else's business. They set up the fences that night when no one was around to see them using their magical powers.  Everyone was moved into the new home that night as they cast their spells for invisibilities and the shields that would kill evil beings in a fifty mile radius of the children. Ninja explored his new territory of twenty acres. Mystic Shadow stood smiling outside as the tiny little Fairies known to mortals as lightening bugs or fire flies would land in her hand excited to meet the High Priestess Mystic Shadow.  'No one must know we are here.' She told them.  They promised to keep their secret and stayed around the cabin sprinkling their magical dust all over the grounds to ward off evil creatures from trying to venture on to the property. One female fairy took a liking to Ninja landing on his nose as he looked at her cross eyed, he would run chasing her for hours.  In the town of Jasper lived a Fox Fairy who was actually an undead spirit stealing love from humans in order to go on living by changing into a human form. This one particular Fox Fairy changed in a young nurse named Sherri. She was beautiful with long black hair, velvet blue eyes, pale skin, having natural red lips. Her body was voluptuous that men found her hard to resist. She preyed on the older men in their sixties that she met while they were hospitalized.  James Kluger was hospitalized for a mild stroke, he was average built, gray hair and mustache, his eyes were brown. She made sure she handled his case for she needed life added to her.  'and how is the most handsome man in the hospital doing today?' she asked smiling at him in her tight nurses dress that she made sure her cleavage was showing as she entered his room .  'Great since you came in here.' He told her smiling; she made him feel good something he hadn't felt since his wife had died three years ago in an automobile accident.  'I have to give you a bed bath.' She told him bending over him to untie the hospital gown as her breast brushed his cheek.  'I am lucky today.' He told her smiling looking at her breast so close he could touch them with his mouth if he had the courage to do it.  She shut the door so she could bathe him without anyone seeing her. She washed his face, chest and back, when she got to his male organ she spent more time washing that area causing him to become erect.  'Well nothing wrong with it.' She told him as she slowly washed it making him wanting to explode then stopping.  'I would give anything to have you climb in bed right now with me.' He told her wanting to have a climax since she got him so worked up.  'Well you could hire me for private duty at your house you know; there no one would be able to disturb us.' She said placing her hand on his hard organ.  'Well that's what I want.' He told her as she stroked him until he climaxed.  'I will go arrange it for you.' She told him giving him a kiss on his lips.  She had it arranged for him to be taken home that day where she would be with him twenty four hours a day. As soon as the paramedics left she was feeling weak, she walked into the bedroom where he waited for this creature of beauty watching her drop her uniform and under clothing on the floor. She joined him in the bed kissing him and stroking him, she licked his mouth going all the way down his body as his wife did not believe in oral sex he was enjoying the pleasures she was giving to him, she straddled him as he caressed her breast, grabbing her perfectly rounded hips as he exploded inside of her and this was how she stole the victims love through the orgasm they received from having sex with her. She stole his love where she was rejuvenated with life and he began to feel worthless.  Each time she had sex with him on a daily bases he felt more worthless and began to waste away until there was nothing left of him at the end of the third week  Cause of death was noted as natural causes from the stroke, but the official record was the Fox Fairy who would move on to another victim to steal love from. She thought she should try men in a bar it might start to look suspicious if too many of her patients died. She went to a bar in the town of Lake City wearing tight fitting blue jeans, a long sleeve blue western shirt with white fringe across her breast line, brown western boots with a white western hat. She sat next to a large Mexican man in his fifty's who was looking her over.  'You want a drink?' he said smiling at her.  'Thank you yes a screw driver.' she told him placing her hand on his leg giving him a light kiss on his cheek.  As they drank their drinks making small talk he asked her to dance, they slow danced seductively, and he rubbed her back then holding her by the ass as they danced. He bragged to his friends how he was going to take her home giving her the best sex she ever had. And his bragging became truth as she let him take her home with him. Once at his mobile home he laid in the bed watching her take her clothes off slowly, he became aroused watching her as he got into bed with him he immediately began fondling her body, kissing her then getting on top of her where he was rough in sex which made him climax faster giving her what she needed life and he began to feel worthless. With in one month he felt so worthless wasting away to nothing he died from natural causes in his sleep.  The fairies told Mystics Shadow of the evil Fox Fairy that night Knight Shadow met her at the bar. Where she had no idea she was trying to entice the High Priest. He smiled at her after an hour with her coming on to him.  'Let's cut to the chase ok. I want to fuck you and you want to fuck me so why don't you follow me to my place and let me fuck your brains out?' he asked rubbing her thigh.  Sherri followed him home, once she got with in the fifty mile radius of the house a huge lightening bolt hit the car blowing her up along with the car. The police ruled it as a freak act of nature when the car behind them reported what happened they could never find any body parts any where. The official cause, Power of the white light.  Kathy started to become very tired and not feeling well Guardian caster sent for their doctor to check her even though she was a mortal she could still administer to her. When the doctor did her examination on her she did not have good news pulling Guardian Caster to the side to talk privately to her.  'She has terminal cancer she will be lucky if she makes it another month.' She told her looking at the poor girl who would soon die.  'I will have Mystic Shadow tell her.' She told the doctor. 'Stay here until we get back here.  Shadow Caster was with Mystic Shadow when she broke the news of Kathy's condition. His eyes tearing up as he heard the woman he loved would only be alive for one more month.  'It is not fair! Why does she have to leave me? She makes my life worth living.' He cried into his hands.  'I will go tell her.' Mystic Shadow told him touching his shoulder as he grabbed her hand.  'Marry us before she dies, tonight if possible?' he asked her looking so lost.  'Sure I will, but let us talk to her first.' She said looking sad as she knew the pain he must be feeling.  They walked into the room where Kathy was sitting with the doctor looking scared knowing she must have found something serious. Mystics Shadow walked up to her sitting beside her on the bed.  'Kathy the doctor found cancer in you.' She told her seeing the fear in her eyes.  'How bad is it?' she asked looking at Shadow Casters face knowing he was holding back tears.' I am going to die aren't I?' she asked knowing the answer in her heart as tears ran down her face.  'Yes Kathy, you have about a month to live.' She told her as tears came to her eyes.  Shadow Caster taking her in his arms.' I don't want to lose you now that I have found you!' he cried holding her tightly.' You're my true love. I want to marry you tonight Kathy.' He told her looking into her eyes.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© She smiled through her tears looking at him.' I love you, I will love you even after I am gone, don't morn my death when it comes because you and everyone here have become my family, I love you all. And yes I will marry you tonight.' She told him crying so hard in his arms.  'We will have the ceremony at mid night.' Mystic Shadow told them as she left the room quickly going to the room with potions and the spell book.  'You can not cure her by magic or potions or you will change the universe.' Guardian Caster told her.  'If we cure a mortal we change the universe, but if we save them from evil we get patted on our backs.' She said sitting over the spell book.  'It's her destiny, look what happened when evil changed your destiny.' She told her.  'Fine! I will do nothing.' She told her walking out of the room.  At midnight the eight witches made the cabin beautiful with sparkling flowers, fairies flying all around, they dressed Kathy in a long white wedding gown resembling a gown a princess would wear.  Her prince wore a white tuxedo as they stood in front of Knight Shadow and Mystic Shadow.  'I Mystic Shadow have gathered our family here tonight to witness the holy union of Kathy and Shadow Caster who want to vow their love as ever lasting love, to honor each other, to treat each other with kindness, Shadow Caster vows to protect his bride Kathy. Never leaving each other unless death causes the separation.' She said as tears rolled down her Face.  'I Knight Shadow ask the Higher Power for the blessing of this union, to protect them from out side forces from destroying what you Our Lord have tied together never to be broken.' He said knowing that death was nearing.  'We the High Priest and High Priestess pronounce you husband and wife.' They said in unison as Mystic Shadow broke down into tears.  'It's alright Mystic Shadow, I am lucky that you all have been here with me and will be with me in my final hour.' She told her crying as were the other witches.  The hardest thing was to watch Kathy grow weaker every day and the pain was sometimes so unbearable. Shadow Caster would carry her everyday to play with the children she had come to love. He would then carry her out to watch the fairies playing with Ninja at night, she would smile as tears formed in her eyes knowing she got to know true goodness through these witches and warlocks and these were the memories she wanted to take with her to her grave.  Kathy woke up in the morning her breathing was becoming raspy. 'baby the time is here for me to leave you.' She told him crying.  'Please gather the others it won't be much longer.' She told him feeling death approaching her.  Shadow caster cried for everyone to hurry as he stood at the door hurrying back to her taking her in his arms. Everyone gathered around her death bed. She looked at everyone with tears. 'I love you all, you have made me happy. I have just one request could I kiss the children good bye?' she asked crying for saying good bye to them would be the hardest part of accepting death.  They handed her Flame Caster.' I will always be watching you from heavens windows.' She told him as he touched her face as if he knew she was dying. They handed Mystical Lightening to her. 'I will miss you little Princess' she was telling her as the angel of death entered the room Mystic Shadow held up her hand for just a few more minutes.' I will always love you and I will be watching you grow from heavens windows.' She told her as Mystical Lightening began to cry hanging on to her tightly, the child's tears fell on to her face, Kathy began to glow brightly and the angel of death departed with out Kathy.  Guardian Caster smiled. 'She has the power to heal through her tears.' She told them as Kathy was a radiant glow then Mystical Lightening let go and Kathy was cured of the cancer.  Shadow Caster grabbed his wife.' You're going to live! Oh thank you Lord for instilling the powers to heal in Mystical Lightening.' He said looking up at the heavens through the window holding Kathy in his arms as they cried witnessing the miracle.  Mystic caster held her daughter kissing her as tears fell softly down her face.' You are truly a blessed gift from the Higher Power.' She told her smiling and kissing her cheek.  Mystical Lightening looked down at Kathy smiling as if she knew she had just performed a healing miracle.  Ben Johnson a forty year old widowed black male, standing five feet six inches, he was stocky with a muscular build, he moved from New Jersey and relocated to Perry Florida, he is an active member of a Satanic cult, he met the widow Amy Meyers two months ago. She is a thirty five year old white female, long blond hair, brown eyes, she was five feet two inches, full figured with a eighteen year old virgin daughter Lisa who looked identical to her mother. Amy Meyers having a hard time financially believed Ben was sent by God to her for he showed up one day at her door with two bags of groceries Amy was unaware he had been watching them for a month finding out her situation. He asked Amy out that night to dinner, Amy couldn't see the harm since he did just buy them food never noticing that he was eyeing her young daughter's body thinking that she was at the right age to be a breeder to him so they could sacrifice the babies since it was believed the younger the animal or child offered to Satan the greater it made the sacrifice . Smiling as he fantasized of assaulting her young body. He would pick her up at seven that evening. Lisa did not like the man, begging her mother not to go out with him.  'Please mom don't go he gives me the creeps.' She begged her mother.  'You just don't like him because he is black Lisa! I am old enough to decide who I will date and there hasn't been anyone knocking to take me out.' She told her daughter as she put her make up on.  Amy decided on a light blue blouse leaving the button open to expose some of her cleavage as she and her daughter were quite endowed, she wore a dark blue skirt that fit tight showing her wide hips.  'Damn I have put on more weight.' She said out loud to her self as she put on a pair of black heels.  When Ben arrived he was dressed in a light yellow long sleeve dress shirt, black slacks with black shoes. He waited in the living room watching Lisa who was in a pair of cut off jeans just below her buttocks and a striped tank top. He watched her as she bent over to pick something up as her shorts would expose her buttocks cheeks, causing him to become aroused. I will enjoy breeding with you. He thought to himself with a smile when Amy entered the room.  'Well I am finally ready.' She said smiling. 'I'll be back later sugar, there is food in there you can eat thanks to Ben.' She told her daughter smiling at Ben.  They ate at a small diner in town making small talk as he was slowly enticing her to return with him to his place. 'Have you seen the documentary they have out about the Occult?' he asked her looking into her eyes.  'I don't believe in that stuff.' She told him eating a bite of steak.  'I have it at my place if you would like to view it with me that is.' he said smiling at her breast making sure she knew he had other intentions  She saw him looking at her breast. Well I haven't had sex with a man for six months and looks like he is interested, guess I will find out if it is true about black men. She thought to herself smiling. 'I would love to watch it with you.' She told him smiling visualizing them in bed instead of watching some boring documentary on the occult.  Once they got to the small efficiency he was renting he put the tape in to his VCR. 'We will have to sit on the bed.' He told her smiling as he watched her climbing on to the bed remembering Lisa bending down.  As they sat up next to each other watching the satanic ritual taking place he leaned over kissing her thinking of Lisa he was kissing, he unbuttoned her shirt keeping his eyes closed placing his hand on her breast feeling the nipple hardened, he licked her chest as he removed her top and bra fondling her breast. He was so aroused from his fantasy of Lisa he took her skirt and panty hose off; he removed his clothes then began oral sex on her. she never heard him whispering Lisa's name for she was enjoying the pleasure his was giving her, only he was using her to act out what he was going to do to Lisa. Once he got to the point where she was going to climax he raised his body over hers as he entered her with his eyes closed visualizing Lisa's face letting out a soft moan as he began to thrust his hips harder and deeper as they exploded into a climax. Amy was unaware while they were having intercourse his brain washing method was sinking into her subconscious mind. After they had sex he took her home promising to come over tomorrow where they all could go on a picnic. He pulled his car down the road a little then walked back to Amy's mobile home where he stood at Lisa's bedroom window watching her undress getting an erection as she looked at her naked body in the mirror touching her well developed breast thinking she was exploring her body in the privacy of her bedroom, but Ben was watching her and masturbating until he climaxed.  'Soon I will be planting my seed in you so that I may sacrifice the virgin child to Satan.' He said to her smiling standing outside her window.  It didn't take Ben more then three days to convince Amy to let him move in with her and Lisa. Amy being so financial strapped and man hungry jumped at the chance of having a man in her life again to help her pay the bills. A month had gone by since he moved in slipping Amy drugs to help him brain wash her faster to giving into his Satanic belief. As they laid in bed he began to explain to her how he needed Lisa to be a breeder for him, meaning he would have to plant his seed in her and the rewards they would be given would keep them from ever having to struggle again. She looked at him thinking to her self, never having to worry about money again.  'would this please you by me helping you to sleep with Lisa?' she asked him not wanting to displease him causing him to leave since he has paid all the bills and she even quit work.  'Yes because we would be doing it together my love.' He told her smiling and kissing her.  'Alright then let's do it.' She told him.  'Ok now you will have to hold her down while I tape her mouth to muffle the screams, then I will do what I must in order to keep our financial situation from dying. If we do not keep him happy he will take it all away. It's a sacrifice I am willing to make by sleeping with your daughter for you are my true love.' He told her his lies knowing she believed everything he told her.  They crept into Lisa's room as she lay sleeping soundly when Amy grabbed her arms over her head while Ben sat on top of Lisa taping her mouth so her screams could not be heard. She looked back at her mother, her face showing her fear as tears fell down her face shaking her head no, feeling her night gown being ripped off of her and his mouth on her between her thighs. she cried harder feeling so dirty when he raised himself over her body entering her with such force she screamed out from the pain with her eyes wide looking at her mother who held her hands back watching this man raping her for what seemed like hours until he released himself in side of her. They left her laying in the bed crying warning her that if she told anyone they would kill her and her grand mother who lived five miles down the road. Lisa lay in her bed bleeding from the rape, crying then ran from her room to the bathroom where she began vomiting violently not believing her own mother was involved with this as she listened to them laughing and then having sex which made her vomit again.  'I hate you both!' she cried knowing if she said anything they would kill her and Grandma.' Oh daddy I wish you were here.' She cried with her head over the toilet.  The next morning her mother left to go to the store when Ben entered her room naked with an erection violating her again as she cried feeling his mouth and body on hers. After the attack he brought her in a drink forcing her to drink it drugging her. She slept for hours waking up finding it was dark out side, looking at her clock it was eight o'clock at night when she saw the door open with him coming into the room. 'Get up your sleeping in our room from now on.' He told her pulling her still naked body out of the bed.  He took her to the shower where he took a shower with her washing her body enjoying touching her breast and between her thighs. Taking her out of the shower as she was almost like a zombie he dried her body.  'You're going to enjoy it tonight, I promise you.' He said grabbing her face with his hands kissing her.  Inside of her mothers bedroom Amy was laying in bed reading a book, Ben gave Lisa the drink that was spiked with a stimulate. She began to feel her body tingling all over. He placed her in the bed next to her mother who gave Lisa a glancing smile then went back to reading her book as Ben took Lisa in his arms kissing her which made her body react with strange feelings, these feelings began to grow stronger as he caressed her breast then he raised her body on top of his moving her hips with his hands causing a strange desire with in her. She liked the way he was making her feel leaning down to kiss him he kissed her passionately as they exploded into an orgasm. Once her mother fell to sleep he took her to her bedroom where he abused her again telling her they were in love or she would not feel like she does with him.  'Do you want me to stop?' he asked her knowing the drug had full control over her body now.  'No. I do love you because you make my body feel so good.' Lisa told him not knowing it was the drug he gave her making her feel this way.  After they had sex for half the night they returned to the bed with her mother who he had knocked out with a drug. Lisa fell to sleep in his arms to be woken the next morning by him having sex with her mother as he looked over at her mouthing I love you. Lisa became jealous of her mother for he was hers now not her mothers.  He sent Amy to the store once she was gone Lisa straddled his lap as he placed his hands under her shirt on her breast.  'Why did you have sex with her if you love me?' she asked him kissing his lips.  'She makes me or I can't have you anymore, like I want you now.' He told her kissing her.' do you want to make me happy?' he asked her kissing her breast.  'Yes I will do anything for you.' She told him believing he was in love with her.  'Use your mouth on me to pleasure me.' He told her unzipping his pants and having her to perform oral sex on him, when she tried to stop he forced her head down on him.' Finish it if you love me.' He told her until he reached his climax. 'Now I know you really love me.' He told her kissing her.  A month later Ben began visiting Amanda who had a reputation with the men in town, she was a single mother of two small boys next door. The mother was only twenty eight years old, petite build, with short brown hair. One day as they were standing in the kitchen he kissed her; he felt her hand on his penis through his pants. Going into the bedroom undressing she began to perform oral sex on him as he looked at the picture of her two small boys hanging on her bedroom wall visualizing sacrificing them to Satan he became even more aroused. She moved her body on top of him riding him slowly teasing him, out of frustration he threw her on her back on the bed entering her forcibly thrusting his hips as hard as he could realizing she liked it the rougher he got, he rose off of her throwing her on her stomach sodomizing her as he fantasized plunging a large silver knife in the heart of the youngest boy. He exploded into an insane sexual orgasm. He wanted more realizing she loved to have pain inflicted on her during sex, he threw her on her on her back tying her hands and feet to the bed as he rammed himself in her as hard as he could, sinking his teeth into her flesh causing her pleasure, wanting more pain as he gave it to her until they exploded together in a climax. Ben went home falling on the bed from sexual exhaustion.  The next morning when Amanda got up to feed her boys breakfast they were not in their beds, their window was open. She threw on her robe running through the trailer park calling out her son's names. Surrounding neighbors came out of their mobile homes including Amy, Ben and Lisa. No one had seen the boys since yesterday she ran back to her mobile home calling the police. The police searched all over until they found the boys. Amanda seeing the police cars pull up ran out of her mobile home thinking they had them in the car. By the officers look on his face she knew it was not good news.  With tears coming to her eyes.' My boys where are they?' she asked holding her hands together.  'We're sorry we found the boys bodies in a dumpster. The oldest Timothy had been sexually molested then suffocated to death, while the youngest boy Mark had been killed with a stab wound in the heart.' The detective told her.  Amanda had this look of terror come over her face as she fell to her knees in shock from the news, tears ran down her face 'Nooooo! God no not my babies!' she cried as the detective picked her up off the ground and she began struggling to get away.' No I want my children! Their not dead! You're lying to me! Who would want to hurt my babies?' she cried as she stopped struggling looking into his eyes as she cried.  'A very sick individual and when I catch him I might just kill him instead of wasting the tax payers money.' He told her holding her as she cried.  The police could not find one finger print inside of the house or side of the house, not of the boys and hardly any of Amanda's as if the place had been wiped clean inside and out. Whoever did this had to come back and clean the place up while she lay sleeping in her bed, they even went in her room quietly. So the police knew it had to be someone she knew and who had been inside the house to know what room the boys were in. She gave them a list of names of people who had been inside including Bens. The detective went next door to question Ben who admitted to being there.  'Man she is a freak, I fucked her ok and she wanted it harder and rougher making me bite her until she got off. I was so exhausted I came home falling on the bed passing out.' He told her as Amy and Lisa listened that he had sex with Amanda. Lisa turned around going to her room not wanting to hear anymore. She lay in her bed crying. After the detectives left she heard her mother and him fighting.  'What my daughter wasn't enough for your sexual appetite? I let you fuck her to conceive a child so we could sacrifice it to get more money and you go fuck that whore!' her mother told him just loud enough so Lisa could hear what they were saying.  Lisa became scared especially when she heard he sacrificed the boys or the money would have stopped. Without making a sound she slipped out of the window running as fast as she could to the woods that she knew like the back of her hand. She kept running and running looking back to make sure she was not being followed by them. She would stop every once in a while until she ran out of the woods where she saw a two story log cabin that was not there almost three months ago the last time she came out here. She watched the lightening bugs flying all around it, she began running to the house for Fear her mother and Ben would find her. Ninja sat on the porch watching the frighten child running up to the house as she stopped looking back for fear they were behind her, she bolted up the stairs banging on the door.  'Help me please!' she cried out, banging even harder when Mystic Shadow answered the door. 'What is wrong?' she asked when she got a vision of Ben killing a baby. Realizing she hadn't vanished either.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© 'Please let me in before they see me!' she told her crying looking back scared for her life.  'Come inside.' Mystic Shadow told her. 'Who is after you?' she asked.  'If I tell you they will kill not just me and Grandma, but you too.' She told her full of fear.  'Trust me no one is going to hurt you, your Grandmother or us.' She said as the others joined her.  'No he is evil, he turned my mother evil!' she cried into her hands.  'Ok I am going to tell you something we are warriors of the white light, we work for the Higher Power, we vanquish evil. Step to the door and watch this.' She told her going outside as she made a clay bird appear in her hand.  The girl could not believe what she was seeing, Mystic Shadow made it fly into the air then blew it up with her magic turning to the young girl  ' we will protect you.' She told her looking serious.  'My mom let this guy move in with us, then they came into my room not long ago and he raped me while my mom held me down.' She cried into her hands.  'Ok hush, let me place my hands on each side of your head I will read your memory since it is to painful for you to remember.' She told the young girl.  Mystic Shadow saw everything as it played out like a movie screen before the room not believing what a mother could allow to happen to her child for some man. They all watched all the things that went on. Even the part of him sacrificing the little boys that Lisa heard them talking about before she left.'  'Why didn't I get a vision?' she asked Knight Shadow.  The shield must be keeping out anything that has to do with evil including your visions.' He told her feeling anger towards this man.  Mystic Shadow stood up, 'Jada Caster, Destiny Shadow lets go pay Mr. wanna be demon a visit, and his wanna be bitch who is going to be shocked to see the real witch!' she said taking hold of Lisa's hand.  'No he'll kill me!' she cried.  Knight Shadow knelt down beside her. 'You have nothing to fear watch the wall over there.' He told her as he played for her where Mystic Shadow fought Lillie.  ' see she will let no harm come to you.' He told her.  'Wow where did you learn to do that?' she asked smiling  'We are good witches, not evil.' She told her appearing inside the mobile homes living room where she could hear Ben yelling at Amy.  Mystic Shadow smiling and clearing her voice. 'Um excuse me Mr. Satan worshipper, but I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light command you and your bitch to appear before me now!' she yelled as she heard them go silent then they were standing in front of her as she held Lisa's hand, Destiny Shadow and Jada Caster who were also in their warrior uniforms, Lisa looked at them even more impressed by these women.  Ben and Amy had fear in their eyes as they knew they were standing in front of real supernatural beings. Ben tried to run as Mystic Shadow slammed him into the wall. 'I never said you could move did I?' she asked bringing him back to her.  Amy was too scared to move as Mystic Shadow looked at her with disgust.' How could you hold your baby girl down and let this foul thing called a man rape her to have a baby to kill?' she asked raising her up in the air.  Amy was so scared she urinated all over herself.  ' He made me or he'd kill me.' She told her.  'Damn your going to really get it now for lying to her since we can read your minds.' Jada Caster told her smiling.  'You lying bitch! You gave her to him to please him for fear of losing him!' Mystic Shadow yelled at her.' Isn't that the truth!' she yelled slamming her down on the ground.  'Yes it's true.' She told her crying looking up at Lisa with contempt.  Mystic Shadow jerked her up off the ground catching her by her throat.' Don't you even look side ways at that little girl!' she told her as she squeezed harder on her throat.  The whole trailer park was standing in front of the mobile home including the detective and Amanda. The detective opened the door. 'I am afraid I can not allow you to go on with this.' He told them holding his gun on them.  Jada caster yelled.' Gun's come to me!' she looked back at the detective 'you have no choice in the matter.' Turning back to the two idiots' I think we should show them to the people out there like they did in Salem.' She told Mystic Shadow.  They brought the two people out in front of the crowd with the detective watching with Amanda. They watched these three women with Lisa. Mystic Shadow looked at the crowd as she raised the couple up in the air.  'I am Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white Light that protects the innocents from evil like these two. Here is a mother who held her daughter down for this slime ball to rape.' She told them as she made the memory from Lisa's mind appear for them to watch. And this jerk wanted to get Lisa pregnant so he could use the infant to sacrifice to Satan!' She allowed the people to see Amy and Ben making the deal. With tears in her eyes for she felt the boys fear, their pain and the loss of the mothers pain going through her body, this slime who lives for Satan killed four year old Mark after sodomizing and suffocating his nine year old brother Timothy, allowing the crowd only to see him injecting the boys and the mother to knock them out so he could take the boys out of the house so they would not wake up.  'I Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white light have been granted by Our Higher Power to send these wicked evil creatures straight to hell where forever together they will dwell!' She said as the people blew up before the crowd as they watched their screaming souls being dragged into hell.  Mystic Shadow walked up to the grieving mother taking her in her arms as they both cried for Mystic Shadow wished she could have gotten a vision.  'Did my boys suffer any?' she asked her.  'No, they were drugged and did not know what was happening. Would you like to be able to say good bye to them?' she asked Amanda.  'Yes, you can do that?' She asked she asked smiling as tears filled her eyes like pools.  Mystic Shadow sent a message to her father who brought the little angels down to their mother. The mother's eyes tearing up as she looked at her boys wearing white suits, white shoes and little white wings that sparkled. The crowd and the detective had tears in their eyes.  'Hi mommy, don't cry over us any more we are in a safe place with nice angels who take care of us. We will see you when it's your time to come home, but its not now mommy.' Timothy told his mother walking up to her hugging her for they were granted a few minutes so she could hug her boys.  'Mommy I play with fairies and a dog name Ralph.' He said smiling running to hug her.' Be good mommy so you can come to our home, it is so pretty.' He told her going back to Fire caster taking his hand.  'I love you my babies.' She told them as they were leaving. 'Thank you Mystic Shadow.' She said hugging her tightly.  Jada Caster turned to the detective.' You might need these in your line of work.' She told him smiling handing his guns back.  'Thank you I am just trying to figure out how to write this report.' He told her.  Mystic Shadow smiled 'they caused themselves to get blown up, it was such a massive explosion there were no body parts left to be found. All of your memories of us will be gone, the memories you have will be they blew up the home when the detective discovered who they were. I will allow your good byes to your sons to have been in a dream.' Mystic Shadow told her turning to Lisa.' I am dropping you off at your grandmother's house, but first I need to inject you with this shot to prevent the pregnancy to continue if it had started.' She told her taking the needle the doctor sent to her.' Ready to go?' she asked smiling knowing that Lisa had a bright future ahead of her filled with college and a very handsome husband who will be a doctor.  'Yes I am ready.' She said smiling at her heroines. Then they vanished taking her to her grand mothers explaining what her daughter in law did to Lisa. That would be the only memory they would have. Lisa staying with her sixty five year old Grandmother filled a void and the loneliness of living alone in her large wooden house.  Three years had past since they moved to the two story log cabin, the twins powers were growing as fast as they were. They were only allowed to fly inside of the house. When they were out side though they had gotten better with their aim since Mystic caster and Lightening caster decided it was time for them to experience farm life, they were able to throw a cow patty using their powers over to the five acres hitting their father with it square in the back where he had set up a garden so the children can eat fresh vegetables, they also have horses that Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow use to ride through the woods on their property. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow found a quiet spot as they sat on the ground taking in nature, she took off her clothes. Knight Shadow watching his wife smiling at her body.  'And what are you planning?' he asked as he realized he was completely naked.  'I plan on riding you big guy.' She told him pushing him back kissing him as they began to enjoy the feel of each others bodies as she sat on top of him.' Getty up horsy.' She smiled moving back and forth slowly driving him crazy. Their passions were building higher and hotter when lightening bolts began striking in different directions. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow sat up quickly looking around. 'Oh shit! We're under attack!' she yelled jumping up to her feet changing into her warrior's uniform as did Knight Shadow. They appeared in the house seeing Mystic caster had the children fleeing up to the room with Guardian Caster.  Mystic Shadow knew there were too many of the Dark side getting past the shield looking up at her daughter. 'Go to Father Quick!' she yelled watching them vanish knowing they would be safe there.  'Lightening Caster has been hit by an electrical ball from a huge demon!' Kathy told them with chaos was breaking out around them.  Mystic Shadow using her powers sent her to her father where Mystic caster and Guardian caster had escaped with the children. Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow ran out of the house seeing the lightening bolts striking demons, but hundreds of others were managing to get through.  Shadow caster carried Lightening Casters body to them crying tears of pain and anguish. 'He didn't make it.' He said crying looking down at his fallen friend.  Mystic Shadow sent him to Guardian caster. 'There still may be time to bring him back.' She told him praying he could be saved.  All of the warriors were battling the demons trying to destroy as many as they could, but they kept coming in flocks. Mystic Shadow was not going to lose one more warrior to them, she began spinning like an F six tornado which is an unconceivable tornado, her winds were up to 319 â 379 mile per hour, sending lightening bolts down striking each of the demons coming on the grounds when Mystic caster returned to avenge her husbands death, she too began spinning up into the air as her mother with just as much force sending fire bombs down on the demons as Knight Shadow , Shadow Caster and the rest of the warriors soared through the air dropping potions to destroy the ones they missed. They all floated above the ground to make sure all were destroyed before they vanished. Mystic Shadow left the land and the cabin to Lisa and her Grand mother whose house was in need of major repair. She signed the note from your Guardian Angel along with the deed. Lisa never moved from the house, her Grand mother lived to be ninety nine years old, Lisa and her husband watched as fairies sprinkled their magical dust over her body watching her spirit soar to heaven.  China Winters a thirty year old woman, with shoulder length light brown hair, dark brown eyes, very thin with hardly any chest became interested in witch craft, demons anything on the supernatural beings. She began to decorate her house from the 1600's buying antique furniture along with paintings of demons hanging through out the house, one was displayed on the wall in front of her bed, she would lay gazing at the painting feeling that his red glowing eyes were actually watching her until she succumb to sleep. He was huge in size and height, his skin coloring was the darkest black she had ever seen with bright yellow short stripes that started from the top of his head to his feet. Un aware that he was actually a demon that a witch had placed him in the painting for eternity as punishment for his savage attacks on women, the painting was to be locked inside of a vault in an abandoned house from years ago, someone bought the house setting the painting out for any one to take it. The painting had been stored in a cave one hundred years ago until discovered by a camper; the camper taking it home sold it in a yard sale. The person who bought it said evil things began to happen after they got the portrait. They quickly get rid of it. The witch added to her spell only the love of a young maiden could free him from his damnation to the portrait. He would watch her sleep thinking of how he would love to torture her before savagely killing her. She became even more obsessed with the picture standing in front of him running her fingers over his body lightly just staring at him with a blank look for hours. He felt the light touch of her fingers tormenting him where he was helpless being held a prisoner in this picture where he could not satisfy his hunger for women.  China and her friends went out drinking on the town going from bar to bar hoping to find a man. Since her friend Molly was very obese with facial scars from acne as a teen, she had brown curly hair. Thinking she would be picked up by a man wearing her red half shirt and short skirt with red heels that looked as if they were cutting her circulation off at her ankles. Jennie who had long blond hair, thick rimmed glasses over her blue eyes with heavy make up on, She and China had Olive oils body, she wore a blue short dress, the top had straps going around her neck, exposing her bony back, wearing blue spiked heels, China had dressed identical to her except that her outfit was red. They drank most of the night with men ignoring them paying attention only to the beautiful women with breast. They went back to Chinas apartment looking at all her paintings when in her bedroom they came to Arion the demon, Molly looked at the picture.  'Damned with that huge organ he has I'd let him fuck me no matter how ugly he is.' She said rubbing his penis. 'He'd choke you to death if you gave him oral.' She said laughing as she kept touching his penis.  I would cut your fat off and let you watch me eat it as you choked to death as I forced you to give me oral sex you bitch! He thought to himself as he was feeling aroused and helpless to do anything about it. Damn you witch for keeping me alive in this painting!  'Not if you did it like this.' Jenny told them taking her tongue licking the portrait slowly up and down his penis.  Do not stop bitch; do not stop. He thought, as he was very aroused now. I would grab you by the back of your head making you take it all the way in your mouth before ripping you apart while alive.  'You think its twelve inches?' China asked looking at the picture as it was making her sexually aroused looking at it.  He looked at her for he found him self strangely attracted to her. You I would pleasure keeping you around as my slave. He thought looking into her eyes as she stared back into his.  'Well we are going to go now, have fun thinking of that big thing fucking your brains out.' Molly told her as they left.  She stood before the picture dropping her dress in front of the picture, touching her small breast; she took her hand touching his penis. 'I wish I could fuck you, I am so hot for you,' she told the picture lying on her bed as she pleasured her self-looking at his painting.  He watched her touching her body, her hips moving as she thought of him exploding into such a climax.  It tortured him even more knowing he could not even release his sexual frustration. Then he thought if she were to start dreaming of me she would fall in love with me releasing me. He smiled, as he would soon be out to fuck her and killing her two friends.  She fell to sleep when she began to dream she was lying in front of the picture pleasuring her self when he stepped out of the painting coming to her, removing her hand she had between her thighs.  'Let me please you my love.' He told her raising his body over hers and entering her.  The pain was excruciating at first, but then she felt pleasure as he was kissing her mouth, neck, sucking on small breast. 'I love you China. If you loved me I could come out of the picture to make love to you all the time.' He told her lying just to get his freedom.' Do you love me? Tell me now.' He said feeling she was going to climax.  'I love you Arion!' She screamed out.  'And now I am going to fuck you!' he said jumping out of the picture.  Her eyes opened seeing him coming to her bed. 'You want this and now I am going to give it you!' he told her grabbing her hand placing it on his penis.  'your real.' she told him feeling fear go through her body. He jumped on top of her kissing her with a foul odor coming from his mouth, her nipples were hard from him sucking on them, her body began to move and groan when he rammed him self into her as she gasped from the pain then pleasure just like the dream.  'You belong to me, you are my slave. I will kill you if you disobey me.' He told her as she climaxed.  'I will be back I must feast, be in the bed waiting for me to pleasure me.' He told her.  He appeared in Molly's bedroom where she laid sleeping in the nude smiling down at his food. He laid on top of her sodomizing her as he ripped her flesh from her back devouring it . The severity of the pain caused her to pass out as he kept feeding on her flesh when he reached an orgasm. Rolling her over on to her stomach, he began ripping off more flesh eating it hungrily. She opened her eyes in severe pain, he sat straddled across her chest. She looked horrified seeing the demon in the picture on top of her forcing his penis down her throat ramming it in until she suffocated to death.  He lay down next to Jenny as she opened her eyes to scream he covered her mouth. 'Why don't you show me how you will lick me?' he asked as he had his hand between her thighs smiling watching her fear fade. 'Tell you what, I will lick you first.' He told her going down on her until she exploded into a climax. 'Now it's your turn.' He told her as she began licking him when he took her head pushing him self as far as he could go down her throat ripping her arm off as this got him more excited until he had her body parts completely ripped off of her, when he climaxed ripping her chest open, she was still alive ripping her heart out and eating it. 'Thanks for helping a demon out.' He told her disembodied corpse laughing as he vanished; he returned at China's apartment.  'You will have to meet new friends, preferably nice big fat girls like Molly.' He told her smiling then taking her with such force.  Each time he had sex with her it seemed she became more obsessed with pleasing him. He was constantly hitting her, her eyes began to show dark circles as her skin tone became a grayish white, she only wore black clothing, he was turning her into one of the living dead by sucking the life force out of her aura. Her life as known before was gone, she now belonged to the Dark side. She would only make friends with obese women so he could go and attack them viciously to feed his sadistic need to feed on flesh while sodomizing the women as he began on their backs just as he killed Molly.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© The pain knocked them out before the visions could get to Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster. His method worked for they always showed a few minutes after he left. They could not even summons him for he had blocked any powers getting to him with the help of an evil witch, she placed a shield around him that made him almost non existent, the Dark side did not want to lose again one of their fiercest evil warriors.  Mystical Lightening was sitting in the garden at the house her mother grew up in for protection, the twins were ten years old now. She could hear her mother and grandmother talking about how to get to this evil demon killing these women. She had the powers to hear even if the person was twenty miles away from her.  'Mommy his name is Arion and Great grandma's sister Angel shadow placed him in a painting never to come out.' She told the two women who had a look of shock on their faces.  'How do you know this?' Mystic Shadow asked her.  'I heard you talking while I was in the garden and I saw it, and he lives with a lady who is dead, but alive?' she said questioning herself for she did not understand that part. 'Her name is China, he lives with her at 105 55 street apartment 2.' She told them as if it was nothing to know this information. Her psychic abilities were beyond what most psychics had.  'Thank you baby!' Mystic caster told her giving her a kiss on her fore head.' When daddy comes home tell him mommy and Grand mommy went to take care of Arion.' She told Mystical Lightening.  Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster appeared in the bedroom where he was making China perform oral sex on him. China sat with her back turned towards the witches and he had his eyes closed.  'Oh stop before I lose my breakfast.' Mystic Shadow told them.  China stood up from the bed slowly looking at them expressionless; Arion sat up in the bed smiling. 'Well, well if it isn't the mother and daughter team. Why don't you join me in bed before I fucking kill you?' He said still smiling then threw two firebombs at them that Mystic caster blew it out before it reached them.  'You need to catch up with the times,' she told him sending an electric ball at China electrocuting her before blowing her up. 'I don't like demon groupies.' She said smiling at Arion.  At the same time, Mystic Shadow cast him back into the picture as he was screaming and struggling not to go back into it. She walked up to the picture taking her finger running down his chest knowing he could feel when someone touched the picture. 'Yes you big bad demon, I put you back in your picture to live in for eternity, but this time I am going to change a few lines.' She told him smiling when suddenly he reached through the painting grabbing her by the throat choking her. She quickly burnt his hand with hers. She quickly grabbed his hand shoving it back in to the picture. 'You really are a pain in the neck! ' she said gathering her self together to cast the spell, ' I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light, order that this vile creature spend eternity in this picture perfect prison, nothing can release him for that is my decision, in this picture he will always dwell, burning for eternity in the lake of hell.' She said blowing him up. His screams could be heard until he had completely vanished.  When they returned Knight Shadow, Lightening caster and Shadow caster was trying to beat the other in throwing distance, they throw electric balls with Flame caster, but the boy was showing them up badly.  'Watch this one.' He said with a smile as he threw a huge flaming ball that hit his great grand father's favorite gazebo blowing it up. His eyes got big as he saw Fire caster walking out of the smoke. 'uh oh.' He said looking at the black smut on Fire casters face and body, his hair standing up wildly on his head, his white suit now gray.' That was a great throw there lad, just kindly aim at other things that are not buildings or anything else of that nature.' He told him smiling as he walked to his cottage to change into a clean white suit as well as cleaning him self-up.  'Yes sir, I am sorry.' He said trying not to laugh.  The grown ups were a different story as they busted out in laughter. Fire caster felt they should be made an example for the children, he dumped buckets of mud over Mystic Shadow, Mystic caster, Knight Shadow, Lightening Caster, Shadow Caster and Kathy's heads.  They all looked at him.' Sorry.' they all said in unison as the mud ran down their bodies while Fire Caster and the children laughed at the adults who stood looking shocked.  'Now that is funny.' Fire Caster said laughing as he rebuilt the gazebo with his powers and he made a target range that would tell the speed and distance Flame caster could throw.  Flame caster turned to look at Kathy smiling.' Kathy your wish has been granted.' He told the woman who looked confused.  'My wish?' she asked him wondering to her self if he heard what she had just thought?  'Yes I did Kathy, try lifting something by concentrating on it.' He told her smiling.  Kathy concentrated on lifting the flower box and it began to rise, she looked stunned.' how did you do that?' she asked.  'You wished to be a witch of the white light, a warrior I granted your wish, so now you're a witch.' He said smiling.  They realized he had the abilities to grant wishes as a Genie, which would be good as long as there were not any repercussions either. His abilities to grant wishes are for those who are good and not asking for riches and fame.  That night as Flame Caster lay in his bed sleeping he heard the weeping of Martha and Harold Langley who just found out their five year old daughter Samantha had chronic heart disease with only six weeks to live. They wished they could take her to Disney world where she had always wanted to go to the magic kingdom, but they could hardly make their bills. The next day Martha got the mail inside of an envelope, were free passes to take Samantha to Magic Kingdom all expenses paid including their food and room at one of Disney's resorts.  'Oh my God, we were just talking about this last night! We must have an Angel watching over us.' She said aloud to her self .  The little brown haired girl who was growing weaker as the days went by smiled as her parents pushed her in a wheel chair through the Magic Kingdom, her big brown eyes showed the happiness in them for they sparkled something that had been missing for sometime.  Flame Caster could not get the little girl out of his head telling Mystical Lightening about her two weeks later after granting the young girls wish.  'Why should we allow her to die? I have the healing power. ' she told him.  'We can't leave here you know ,there are evil beings wanting to kill us.' He told her.  'We don't have to watch.' She told him as she stood up in the middle of her bedroom.' I mystical Lightening grand daughter of the high priestess Mystic Shadow wish to have my tears delivered to Samantha Langley who has a chronic heart disease for the tears to fall softly on her face erasing the disease without any trace.' She chanted as tears fell from her eyes.  Samantha slept while sprinkles of Mystical Lightening fell upon the Childs face as she began to glow a brilliant white light. The next morning she woke up with strength that she had not ever felt before, running to her mother smiling.  'I feel great mommy!' she told her mother standing in their kitchen.  Her mother called the doctor who wanted to examine her finding nothing wrong; her heart was beating, as a healthy heart should. They ran test finding nothing.  'She's cured. I don't know how but she is going to live a very long life.' The doctor told the parents.  When the story of the little girl's miracle hit the news, it reinforced the innocents of their belief in their God and having those who did not believe to become firm believers. This caused great anger amongst the dark side for now they were more determined to get more souls and by doing so, they would create distrust among the mortals by starting scandals in their churches starting with the Christian schools. They would send in their demons as Christian teachers to teach the teenager's who were the most vulnerable to lead a stray. Of course it would become public knowledge that the faith they put their trust in were molesting their beloved teenager's. One teacher would not do much harm, but hundreds from all over the world would cast doubt in their faiths, just what the dark side wanted.  Christina Phelps a thirty four year old high school teacher who specialized in math. showed up at the interview wearing a blue skirt that fit loose to her mid calf, a white shirt buttoned up to her neck, a blue blazer with very little make up, her long hair wore up in a bun.  'You seem very much what we are looking for here at Christian youth school. Now you will be teaching eighteen and nineteen-year-old boys and girls who we know are the age that they could be tempted into having forbidden sexual relations before marriage, the use of drugs and alcohol. They are at the age where they can be led into temptation.' The principle of the school told her.  'I know exactly what you mean; they can be led into committing sinful acts at this tender age.' She smiled at him so sweetly. That is exactly what I am hoping for. She thought to her self.  The next morning she wore a bright yellow sleeveless mid calf dress that fit just slightly loose, still showing off her luscious body, with white heels as the principle introduced her to the class. After he left, she walked around the room checking over the boys and girls she would be seducing into sex, drugs, and satanic rituals. During the day when a male student needed help she made sure that one of her breast touched the side of his face smiling down at him so the rest of the time he was concentrating on her body, wondering if she had meant for it to happen. She sat on top of her desk she implanted in each of the boys minds sexual thoughts of her with them, she'd walk by each one giving them a seductive look. She noticed by the end of the school day Mark a eighteen year old, with wavy short brown hair, fair complexion, who was thin and very tall had not lost the erection he gotten from thinking of her giving him oral sex.  'Mark would you mind staying after class? I would like to speak with you to that I think will help you.' She said smiling at him still sitting at his desk trying to cover his erection so no one would see it. After standing by the door telling the entire student's good-bye she smiled pleasingly at the boys looking at her body passing by her, she had succeeded with the first temptation called lust. She locked the door behind her without Mark knowing. Christina walked back to Mark sitting at his desk, where she stood behind him leaning over so her breast was pressed up against the back of his neck, as she pointed to the paper smiling she could see how well endowed he was by his erection.  'What do we have here?' she asked placing her hand on his erection rubbing it softly she heard him inhale deeply.' You're so well endowed for your age.' She told him with her lips touching his ear she kept moving her hand over his penis.' Does it feel good Mark?' she asked him in a whisper kissing his ear.  The young boy nodded his head.' stand up Mark.' She told him kissing his neck.  Mark stood in front of her, he had never had sex except to a magazine he found at his friends house, it showed different sex acts performed. She took his hands placing them on her breast having him to touch her entire body; she began to kiss his lips running her tongue slowly over his lips. Getting down on her knees, she performed oral sex on him until he exploded.  He fell back into his desk breathing heavy.' Oh wow that was great.' He said looking at her smiling.  'Come to my house and we will go swimming.' She told him kissing him passionately.' I want to have real sex with you.' She told him still kissing him hungrily. 'Here is my address I will be expecting you at six this evening.' She told him placing his hand inside of her thong so he could feel her moistness with her dress pulled up around her waist.  That evening Mark showed up in swimming trunks, he could not believe how hot she was in the white bikini that just barely covered her breast the bottoms were a thong. He began to get an erection just looking at her body, he followed her to the pool watching her drop her suit to ground going in naked, he did the same going into the pool embarrassed of the erection he had.  'Don't be embarrassed it's natural for that to happen.' She told him not being able to wait to take his virginity completely away from him, making her beliefs become his which was pure evil.  'Isn't this a sin?' he asked her as she placed her nude body against him kissing and licking his neck.  'Did it make you feel bad when I gave your big boy oral sex?' she asked holding his penis in her hand touching her body all over with it.' does this feel bad?' she asked taking his hand placing it between her thighs..  'No, it felt really great, I like you touching me and touching your body.' He told her as his breathing was becoming heavy.  'Only sin feels bad, so this can't be a sin.' She told him wrapping her arms around his neck, placing both hands on her breast  'All the other teachers say to lust or masturbate is a sin.' He told her caressing her breast as she taught him how to do it the way a woman likes it.' I am sorry.' He told her feeling embarrassed that he ejaculated inside of her.  'what time do you have to be home?' she asked smiling at him as she kissed him being very much aroused now.  'Eleven.' He told her she made him feel desires he never had before; even masturbating to his book compared nothing to this.  'We have plenty of time to study then.' She told him taking his hand and leading him up stairs to her bedroom.  She told him how to please a woman, with soft kisses all over their lips, necks, breast, running his tongue down her stomach teaching him to perform oral on a woman. The sounds of her moans, her hips moving when she let out a loud moan reaching her orgasm, her body arched. This lesson excited him even more with her sitting on top of him moving slowly pleasuring them both as they exploded together in a climax.  This was the first day that the dark side began to teach these innocent children, the beginning of teaching of their satanic rituals with these unsuspecting teenagers. Sex played a major part for demons in their rituals and they would guide these children all over the world with a demon placed in each Christian school. For this marked the first day that each demon had taken one of their student's virginity.  The second day of school for Mark was just as exciting as the first knowing what they had done together the day before, watching her move, remembering her naked body, her touches, the orgasms. He could not wait until tonight.  Christina had other ideas though that did not include Mark, but Julie Randall was her next victim. Mark did not think much of it since she was a girl. Christina massaged the girls shoulders as she sat at her desk feeling her relax with her.  Once alone in the class room Christina kept massaging the girls shoulders. 'Let's go swimming at my house.' She said smiling at the girl who was over weight and all the students made fun of her.  'Ok ,but I need to pick up a suit.' She told her teacher.  'No you don't, we're both girls we can swim in the buff.' She told her smiling as she grabbed her by the hand.  Once at her house they stood by the pool dropping their clothes to the ground, the girl looked at her teachers body, Christina swam up to her.  'I find you very pretty with your blond hair, and those blue eyes.' She told her then kissed her lightly on her lips.  The girl felt panicked.' I better go.' She said trying to get away from her teacher, feeling she was being sexually threatened.  Christina stopped her placing her body up against her. 'Wait, just give me five minutes and then if you want to still leave you can. I find you attractive.' She said touching her face.' I would not do anything that would hurt you.  'Alright I will stay, but I can leave if I want too.' She told her teacher  'You have a deal.' She told the girl kissing her softly, touching her breast, causing Julie to feel a strange desire inside of her body; she began to kiss her back as Christina placed Julie's hand on both of her breast.  'I want to take you to my bedroom so I can make you feel more desires.' Christina told Julie putting her hand between her thighs.  Julie liked the way Christina was making her feel. 'alright.' she told her kissing her back softly.  Christina took the young girl to her bed where Julie experienced orgasms, Christina taught her how to please her as well. Christina convinced Julie that what they did was not wrong, it was the thinking of the other teachers that were wrong and that is why they had to keep quiet, and meeting only once in awhile. Other wise if they found out they would make sure they were never to see each other and branding each of them as evil sinners.  John Trent a tall, slightly built black male age thirty six, five feet eight inches tall, very well built, who was teaching in another school. He had spotted his victim, Tammy White, a eighteen-year-old girl who was very endowed her breast being a thirty-six d. The rest of the girls were not quite as large, she had a nice build even in the white short sleeve shirt with the blue and black plaited skirt, white knee high socks and black shoes that laced. She wore her long blond hair down with a blue headband. John Trent planted images of her and him having sex on his desk where she began to daydream about it. He could see her nipples getting hard. He smiled knowing she was getting primed for him to make his move after class.  She would catch herself wondering why she was having these wicked thoughts about her teacher. She did not stop it because thinking of him made her feel strange, but good. After class, he asked her if she would stay, he needed to speak with her about her grades. She sat at her desk nervous not seeing him locking the door as he walked up to her desk.  'You are doing really great, but I feel that if you and I work a little together we could turn your B's to an A+.' He told her looking down at her he could tell she was thinking of him sexually as he spoke to her.' You look so tense let me massage your shoulders,' he told her going behind her desk.  He began slowly feeling her breathing become heavier, he slowly moved down her chest watching her getting aroused, he placed both hands on her breast, she laid her head against him wanting him to touch her more. Taking her hand pulling her up to him she could feel his erection against her. She wrapped her arms around his neck kissing each other while he was taking off her clothes and his. He led her to his chair sitting her on his lap; he entered her taking her virginity. He fondled her breast kissing them, taking his hands placing them on her hips moving them to bring them both into a climax. Muffling her mouth with his so her moans of pleasure would not be heard.  'Can you come to my house? I want to do so much more to you.' He told her kissing her.  'Yes I will go with you.' She told him thinking this was love.  Once in his bedroom he had her on the bed where he preformed oral sex on her driving her crazy until she exploded.' If you love me as much as I do you then show me like I just showed you.' He told her smiling explaining how to do it.  The next day she could only think of him making her feel so good understanding why they had to be careful. After school he asked a nineteen year old boy name Luke Black to come to his house to mow his yard, once at his house he gave him a drink with a drug in it to make him sexually aroused so he could have the dark haired boy with blue eyes who was very thin and tall. John began massaging Luke's back, before to long the drug took effect on him, he became aroused, he felt strange being aroused by his teacher. John turned him around seeing his erection pinning him against the wall kissing him and then taking him to the bedroom where they had sex for hours. John at the end took him with anal sex as the boy pleaded for him to stop, but John enjoyed inflicting pain on the young boy. He continued until he was full filled.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© After six moths the dark side plans were working, the demons had started their occults through out the world. Their rituals involved sexual rituals with one another. At their rituals, they sacrificed small animals. Drugs so they could gain mind control, their followers began to get the other teenagers in their schools to join by seducing them as their teachers did to them, then having them to join the new religion. Teenagers over the world were acting strange, beating on their parents, raping their siblings, shooting people with out cause. Not one person asked for help making the White light warriors helpless to put an end to it.  Tammy walked into Travis's bedroom who was sleeping, he worked nights while his wife worked days, his wife a heavy woman with gray hair, he was thin with graying hair. Knowing the house was empty Tammy slipped into bed with her father naked, she began an oral seduction on him waking him up to see his daughter pleasuring him, he tried to stop her knowing this was wrong, it was incest, but she kept kissing him, touching him, he was weak giving into the temptation. He and his wife had stopped having relations years ago making it hard for him to fight off the lust he had been feeling every day looking at her body, masturbating thinking of her so many times and now his fantasies had come true he told him self for justifying his lust for his own child. He had sex with her for hours, lusting over her developed body, Tammy allowed him to perform whatever kind of sex on her that his wife would not allow him to do. He would come home from work kiss his wife good bye as she went to work. Going straight to the shower where Tammy was waiting naked, carrying her to the bed having sex with her. They talked of marriage and getting her pregnant, forgetting it is illegal to have sex with your child much less to marry your child. Their relationship went on for three months, they were in the bed performing oral sex on each other not knowing his wife and her mother walked into the bedroom as she had started to suspect something was going on, but she never suspected this!  'Your creatures of the devil!' she yelled at her husband and daughter.  Tammy jumped from the bed with hickies covering her body, Tammy smiling walked up to her mother.' My teacher at your so called Christian school, he taught me well, if you're jealous I will fuck you too.' She told her mother smiling grabbing one of her mothers breast, moving her tongue provocative at her when her mother slapped her hard across the face, the two began fighting. Tammy grabbing her mother by her shirt pulling her close to her smiling evilly at her .' He likes how I suck him, fuck him, and we are getting married. 'Tammy told her grinning.' Oh yes one more thing mommy dear, we are going to have a baby!' she yelled at her mother standing at the edge of the stairs. The look of horror all over her face, she could not believe what she was hearing looking at Tammy as if her daughter was possessed.  'I can't stand here chit chatting with you mother, I have to go finish fucking my daddy, something that you haven't had with him in years. Now I am getting it all!' she yelled.' I hope your have a nice trip though mommy.' She told her smiling and then pushed her mother down the stairs snapping her neck. Tammy laughed at her mother's dead body then turned around going back to her father who had been waiting for her to return.' Mommy went away for good.' She told him kissing him as she sat on top of him moving her body teasingly smiling when she felt him get erect again; evil had consumed their souls with no return from their damnation for eternity. They let her dead mother lay there for three hours before calling to report her accident saying he was sleeping.  'How do you want to be punished this time?' he asked smiling fondling his daughter.  'You choose the pain.' She said smiling at him as she got on her hands and knees.' make it hurt real good daddy, I am a nasty girl.' She said as they laughed together  Her mothers death was ruled accidental, at the funeral they request sometime alone with her mother closing the doors she stood bent over looking at her dead mother 'you should have joined us instead of staying with the so called good people and you'd still be alive today.' Tammy told her mother's corpse.  They were married by John, the ceremony was followed by their ritual of sex with the others, it was John who had the liberty to have sex with the bride dressed in a black wedding dress taking her with brutal force, Her father had sex with a thirteen year old girl who had been brought into their new church by her eighteen year old cousin Jason who taught her about pleasing him sexually at the tender age of nine. The rest also joined the ritual.  Five years later they still had not been caught seducing the teenagers in the Christian schools. They were feeling as if they were now invincible to the white light and its warriors or anything representing good in the world. eighteen year old Lacy Weather spoon began school at the Christian school with Christina as her teacher. Christina looked the girl over thinking to herself she couldn't wait to have her join their church watching how she had the perfect shape, nice bust and very nice rear. As soon as school was dismissed Christina asked the girl to join her for swimming just as she had with all the other females. Lacy agreed pinning her shoulder length brown hair up with a clip as they walked out to Christina's car. Once at the pool Christina told her.' I don't wear suits, but if you feel uncomfortable I'll get you get you a long shirt.' She smiled at her so sweetly.  'It's ok we're both females and I don't think your weird or anything.' She told Christina smiling feeling safe that her teacher was not a molester.  'Want a drink?' Christina asked her looking at her taking off her clothes. Drug time! I am having sex with that perfect body today. She thought to her self as she went to go get the drinks.  Lacy drank her soda down fast she was so thirsty.' Wow that tasted funny.' She told her looking at the can.  'Really? Mine is fine.' She said sitting the can down.  As they swam in the pool she began planting thoughts of sex acts with her in Lucy's mind, she kept trying to push the images out of her mind. Christina swam up to her.  'Are you alright?' Christina asked her touching her face lightly sending an irresistible urge through Lucy's body to kiss Christina's hand. Smiling as the young girl began to kiss her hand Christina pulled her body up to hers kissing the girl passionately.  Christina led her upstairs to her bed where she made the young girl have sex with her until Christina was completely satisfied with her.  Once Lacy was home she felt sick to her stomach for what happened to her, knowing she had to be drugged. She began Praying for help and protection from this wicked woman. Enchantress Caster appeared in her room.  'I am here to help you.' She told the young girl who looked at her with fear in her face.' I was sent here because of your prayer.' She told her standing in her white light uniform.  Lacy cried telling her what happened to her by her teacher at her house when they went swimming. Enchantress Caster looked at her  Sadly for the young girl had been violated. Enchantress Caster changed into regular clothes.  ' I think it's time we pay her a visit.' She said smiling.  'You have magical powers?' she asked looking at Enchantress Caster so surprised.  'I am a warrior of the white light who protects those who are innocent and want our help.' She told her. 'In others words a good witch. Now are you ready little sister?' she asked her smiling.  They appeared in Christina's bedroom that was lying in her bed with the Principle of the school having sex with him.  'Not very Christian like now is it?' Enchantress Caster asked the couple who sat up quickly in bed.' I am here to kick your ass for the rape of this child!' she told them angrily.  'Who the fuck are you?' Christina asked Enchantress Caster.  'Oh I am sorry, where are my manners? This is who I am.' She told them changing into her warrior uniform. 'Enchantress caster warrior of the white light power.  They both threw fire balls at her making her laugh; she caught them in her hand looking at them then blew them out.' Now you just went and pist me off! I enchantress caster sister of Mystic shadow the High Priestess cast these two pass hell to the one whose appetite is for evil souls he desires to feed for these demons and their evil deeds. For I cast this spell and ask the higher power to break any hold that they and their counter parts may have on the innocents they have forced to be one with them, I ask that they be cast them far from hell, But to the place that he dwells!' she chanted as the two demons blew up, as did the rest who were demons through out the world involved in this evil seduction of the children in the Christian schools. For those who were still innocent they were able to seek counseling trying to live a normal life, their faith in their God restored even stronger. For those who still worship the dark side are in the prison systems through out the world. Including Tammy and her Father, their child was placed for adoption. There were hundreds of teachers who gave into temptation willingly and for those who fought unknown to the public they were killed and replaced with a demon. It was the biggest scandal to hit all the papers for the dark side, for once again good prevailed. Lacy grew up to be a prosecuting attorney locking away as many of the evil mortal's that she could.  The fair lady a very powerful fairy who often changes shapes from horses to a beautiful woman in a white dress with long brown hair, but most of the time as a naked woman traveling from town to town seeking shelter. Who ever gives her shelter for the night she would cast a spell making something happen to them from turning dumb or something much worse. She appeared in front of a newly wed couple Rodney and Shannon who hadn't been married a month, Rodney a heavy set man with black hair and brown eyes who always wore plaid shirts and blue jeans with brown work boots opened the door to see the beautiful naked woman standing there.' Uh Shannon come here, hurry honey.' He called for his wife trying not to look at the woman's nakedness.  Shannon came to the door in her night gown and robe, she had short brown hair and she was heavy set, seeing the beautiful naked woman that her husband was now looking at intently. 'What do you want?' she asked irritated thinking this was a joke by one of her friends.  'Please someone has stolen my clothes from me, my money; I am not around from here. Now I am with no place to stay as they were taking me to my destination and instead robbed me of everything.' She told them crying.  'Of course you can stay here.' Shannon told her feeling sorry for her.  The Fairy lady cast a spell that would change their lives for ever from that night on. They showed her where she would sleep and then left her alone. As the couple sat watching television Rodney asked his wife for a sandwich feeling very irritable for no apparent reason towards her.  'I'll fix it as soon as a commercial comes on.' She told him smiling at her husband.  'You lazy bitch! I said now! Not when a commercial comes on! Get up and do it now!' he screamed at her, his face was turning red with veins protruding out of his neck.  Shannon looked at him like he was a stranger out of the five years they lived together before getting married. He had never been a violent person. 'What is wrong with you?' she asked him confused by the way he was acting.  'I guess you need to be shown where the fucking kitchen is?' he yelled at her banging his fist on the arm of the couch.  Suddenly he jumped up from the couch pouncing on top of Shannon sitting in the recliner; the force of him pouncing on top of her sent them and the chair back wards on the floor. He began to beat her with his fist in her face, breaking her arms when she tried to protect her face from his punches. He stood up dragging her body on the floor into the kitchen by her hair; he forced her to her feet then smashed her face into the refrigerator over and over with all of his strength breaking every bone in her face.  'This is where we keep the damn lunch meat you dumb bitch!' He screamed at her smashing her face again with brut force into the refrigerator.  As if that was not enough he threw her on the ground kicking her, jumping on her head, back, and legs like a mad man until he was grabbed by police officers who busted in the kitchen door because a neighbor witnessed the brutal beating through her kitchen window facing theirs.  The officers grabbed him throwing him to the ground and hand cuffing him. 'is there anyone else in the house?' the tall officer asked him finding it hard to look at the mangled woman lying bloodied on the floor, in his twenty years of police work he had never seen an attack so viciously that it made a person look like a monster from a movie.  'There is some bitch upstairs that I would have fucked if you guys hadn't stopped me from getting rid of this trash!' he yelled.  The officers checked the entire house to find there was not a soul in the house, and the room Rodney told them she was in had been boarded up. They broke in fearing he may have killed her before beating his wife. The room was full of cobwebs and thick dust; no one had been in there for years.  Shannon survived the attack, having to be tube fed, she was paralyzed from the neck down, her voice box was smashed so severely it was beyond hope. She had massive brain damage; she did not have any family members to take care of her, she had to be placed in a care facility.  Rodney was put to death two years to the date of the attack.  The Fair Lady appeared at a large ranch as a beautiful black horse running up to the owner of the ranch Paul Wright a twenty six year old self made millionaire, married with two young children, he was extremely physically fit, he had been told he looked like a young George Strait. ' hey there girl, how did you get here?' he said patting the horse. 'Anyone know who this horse belongs to?' he asked his ranch hands but no one had any idea.  'well I guess we have a guest until we find her owners .' he told them leading her to the stalls where he placed her an empty one giving her horse feed , hay and water.  Paul was walking out to help his ranch hands to break a horse when he suddenly fell to the ground, the ranch hands ran to him where he laid staring blankly up at the sky. Steve his brother ran to call for the ambulance. When they arrived, they pronounced Paul dead. The coroner ruled the death as a massive coronary. The next day when Steve went to feed the horses, the black beauty had mysteriously vanished.  The Fair Lady wearing the white dress stood in front of a small white house with a picket fence with roses growing around the fence, two rocking chairs on the front porch, sitting in one was an eighty eight year old woman dressed in a dark blue dress with small white flowers on it. She approached the woman slowly.  'I am stranded here in town, I haven't any money and was wondering since night time is approaching if I may stay the night until morning?' she asked the kind old woman  The old woman smiled like an angel at her.' Why yes you can dear, I just sit here waiting for my Charlie to come and take me home with him one day. That was my Charlie's rocking chair; we would sit here and just rock together. I continue our rocking. How I miss him.' The old woman told the mysterious woman as tears filled the old woman's eyes.  That night as the old woman slept in her bed she was awakened by Charlie standing over her bed.' Come dear it's time to go home.' He told her taking her hand as they began to walk and vanish. Still laying in her bed was her body with a smile of happiness on it.  The Fair Lady showed up in the woods where there were boy scouts camping out deep in the thick woods, she approached them in her white dress.' I have gotten lost in the dark out here. May I stay at your camp until morning so I can find my way out?' she asked as three adults and children sat around the fire.  'Yes, we can't have you wondering around the woods.' The male told her looking at her body smiling.  The older woman smiled, her own shadow scared her and trusted no one. The wife looked at her with jealousy then showed her a tent she could sleep in.  The next morning the boy scouts were found wondering down the road, they could not talk but refused to go back into the woods for whatever they saw scared them speechless. When the authorities found the camping spot, they found the remains of the adults scattered around the camp, large footprints that looked like some kind of creature, they were not familiar with and it walked on two feet. When they got one boy to draw what it looked like they drew a demon like creature very large. With long fang like teeth and claws on its fingers and toes.  The Fair Lady showed up in a cabin in the mountains naked where two brothers lived. When the one brother opened the door he could not believe his eyes.' Joe, come here! Look at this!' Tommy yelled.  His brother Joe came to the door and saw the naked woman. 'Damn girl, what are you doing out here naked?' he asked.  'This man gave me a ride and tried to rape me, I just kept running until I saw your cabin.' She told them crying.  With the same intentions for her, they let her in and then both of them grabbed her and raped her as the other one held her down taking turns half the night with her, when they were done forcing her to have sex with them they threw her into a closet and locked it so she could not escape. They planned to keep her around to pleasure them until they got tired of her and then would kill her. The next morning they got up to fix something to eat when they opened the closet to throw her in a plate it was empty.  'What the fuck?' Joe asked looking at the empty closet.  'What is she dead?' asked Tommy thinking she might have suffocated in the closet.  'Its worse, she is gone!' Joe yelled looking around to see how she could have gotten out. 'Fuck! She will go to the authorities!' he yelled running out side to find there were not even footprints on the damp morning ground.  They waited all day for the authorities to show up, but no one came. Later that night there was a knock on the door. They opened the door thinking the law finally came. They were surprised to see a sexy blonde-haired woman standing there in black tight leather one-piece pants suits that were strapless just up above her breast with black spiked shoes. The woman pushed her way into the cabin grabbing the men kissing them. They took their clothes off, as did the she. Both men could not believe their luck; she took each man separately into the back room, as soon as their penises enter the woman it felt like acid was eating away their penises. They could not push the she-devil off. The woman was laughing and turned into a hideous demon ripping the two men's flesh off and eating it as the men screamed in terror and horrifying pain. The creature began to rip the men apart, throwing their body parts all over the cabin. She kept them alive until she reached in their chest cavities ripping their pumping hearts out and eating them. The men's decomposed body parts wasn't discovered until three weeks later by their cousin a huge biker, who ran from the cabin in fear of his own life.  The Fair Lady appeared at the door of a Southern Baptist preacher in the middle of the night, the preacher looked at the woman dressed in a white dress. 'Is something wrong?' he asked very concern thinking she was in danger.  'I was traveling when two men took my car, wallet; the police said they would look for them. I have no where to stay and something told me to stop here that you might be kind enough to get me off the streets just for tonight.' She told him.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© He felt sorry for the young woman and let her sleep on their couch. The next morning she was gone along with the preacher's voice that she had stolen, his wife now had the mind of a three-year-old child.  The warrior's of the White Light had been tracking the Fair Lady for years, but they were always one-step behind her and tonight she stood in front of Samantha's house that was now twelve years old. A black cat ran up on to the porch meowing as Samantha opened the door, looking down at the cat that was looking up at her. A storm had begun to start as lightening striking through the sky.  'Hi kitty, you better come inside for the night there's a horrible storm coming.' She told the cat picking her up.' We had better go to my room; my parents would not like a cat in the house.  After her parents went to sleep, she snuck down stairs to get some milk and tuna for the cat to eat. 'Ok now you eat and I will see you in the morning.' She told the cat holding her in her arms then kissed her on top of her head.  As soon as the little girl was a sleep, she jumped up on the bed making sure she was sound to sleep. She wanted the heart that Mystical Lightening healed. The Fair Lady lay on top of the child as her cat eyes glowed purple. The next morning when Samantha's mother came in to wake her daughter, she found her laying on her back with her eyes opened wide with fear as if something scared her to death.  'No! No please Samantha! Wake up baby! Please wake up for mommy. Please Sammy don't leave mommy! I can't live life without my ray of sunshine.' She cried taking her daughter into her arms rocking back and forth with her.' Why did you take my baby from me! Why my Sammy?' she cried laying her down when her father walked into the room.  'Dear God no!' he cried out in pain falling back into the wall.  The coroner's office told her parents that her heart had exploded; there wasn't any reason for her death, the heart was perfectly healthy.  Her grieving parents arranged for her funeral having her placed in a pink casket with white lining, a long silk pink gown with matching satin slippers. People from all over came to pay their respects and good byes to the miracle child.  Mystical Lightening and Flame Caster were in the garden when Samantha's spirit appeared before them. 'The Fair Lady blew my heart up while I was sleeping.' She told them 'I was told to come here that Mystic shadow would explain to me what was happening.' She told them, as she felt very confused.  They led her to their Grandmother who explained the whole story of how they saved her from dying at five and now The Fair Lady killed her by causing her heart to explode to hurt the faith of the innocent and good.  'You made a miracle happen which gave the innocents more support in their belief in good. So they had the Christian children to be seduced, and drugged by the Christian leaders, who started out as demons, then others gave into temptation and the ones who resisted were killed.' She explained to them then turning her attention to Samantha. 'Samantha you will stay here with us where you will be taught to be a great spiritual warrior because you are the miracle child and the Higher Power has great plans for you.' She told her smiling touching her face lightly.  As Mystic shadow was helping, Samantha to understand what had happened to her because Mystical lightening had healed her heart by sending her tears to sprinkle on her face it had infuriated the evil ones.' They could not just make your heart stop because of the healing that Mystical lightening had used was to powerful, they took the other alternative by blowing it up.'  The twins walked out side reading their minds they showed up standing behind the Fair Lady.  'So what is so fair about you lady?' Mystical lightening asked her.  The Fair Lady turned towards them with glowing eyes, smiling they began to electrocute her with the use of their eyes, their powers together were so powerful her eyes flew out of their sockets, along with her teeth, the rest of her exploded and then they sent her to the one that feeds on evil souls. When they returned Knight Shadow was waiting for them.  'what were you thinking by going out after knowing the Dark Side would love to get a hold of you two?' he yelled at his grand children.  'No disrespect sir, but just because we are seven teen does not mean that we are children.' Flame caster replied.  'No it doesn't, but the dark side will retaliate even more vicious now. Just promise me no more taking off by your selves?' he asked them.  'We promise Grand father.' They both answered in unison.  The Dark side fumed and ordered that one hundred of their most seductive witches were to replace the women married only to Christian men, bare a child with them then slaughter that child on one of their most religious holiday Christmas eve the day the Christian's savoir was born and Easter day when he had arisen from the dead. Returning the body to the real wife where she would pay for their sins. They had to do as much damage as possible before the great battle in four years when the twins turned twenty one years old and their powers were completely in tact and more powerful then all the nuclear weapons in the worlds armed forces. The Dark Side told the witches to meet the woman in their churches take over their  Bodies while the real wives lay dormant in their own bodies. The witches of course would act as Christians do, only making the husbands lust for them so intensely they end up pregnant in February delivering their babies in November and massacre the infants on Christmas Eve. The other fifty would make sure they conceived and delivered a month before Easter since it changed days and months they had to pay attention. They then would move on to another husband alternating the holidays for their birth for the next four years.  The first fifty evil witches was sent to church that Sunday to chose a wife to replace, once the woman went to the rest room the witch then took over.  Xavier the high witch spotted him, Tom Franklin was a short heavy man, and balding with a thick mustache, what was left of his hair was black. By the look on his wife Connie Franklin's face, she was full of frustration, and slightly over weight. They both were thirty years old. She smiled smugly watching the couple together. I will bet they hardly ever have sex; he will enjoy having me around for a while, I love sex with whatever I can find to put out my fire. She thought to herself. As soon as his wife went to the bathroom Xavier stepped into her body. She came out of the bathroom and sat next to her husband Tom rubbing his thigh close to his penis. That night after dinner she cleaned the kitchen with her magic, then went to the bedroom trying to find something seductive and there was nothing. Using her magic, she wore a black lace see through teddy showing her flesh underneath the out fit, she wore black spiked heels, make up and perfume , she stood looking in the mirror. Thank you for having large breast, which is all you have going for you. She thought to her self and walked out to her husband sitting in his recliner half a sleep. Oh I am going to wake you up. She thought to her self straddling him in the chair.  'Do you like my new outfit?' she asked kissing him softly licking his ears and sucking on his neck.  'I'm not really in the mood.' He told her as she placed his hands on her breast.  'Let me get you in the mood then.' She told him sliding down his body pushing the chair so he was sitting up. She unzipped his zipper taking her tongue slowly around the head of his penis then began sucking on it.  'You told me this was part of evil, what changed your mind?' He asked, but did not stop her either. 'Oh baby. 'He said with his eyes closed, his breathing heavy. He was not going to resist her as he was on cloud nine. Pushing the chair back she took him right there in the chair as he fondled her breast, loving this exciting sex with her and not the usual on her back in the bed.  He slept like a baby all night. The next morning she had his breakfast ready when he came into the kitchen and he found she serving it naked as she stood there smiling.  'I want you.' She told him massaging her breast.' Pull your pants down.' She told him laying on the kitchen table as he took her with the passion he never knew before, it felt like he was cheating, she was so different and he was loving it as he heard her scream out from an orgasm.  The men whose wives were replaced with the witches in the other states were all going to work with smiles on their faces for they had sex with their wives like they never did before.  That night when Tom got home he couldn't wait for dinner to be over with. While she cleaned the kitchen he waited in bed naked for her. She walked in smiling. Poor deprived man. She thought to her self.  'What have you always wanted to do sexually?' She asked.  'Tie a woman on her stomach and you know do it where women don't like. 'He said nervously.  'Ok, but you have to do me first then you can tie me up.' She told him. Straddling him as she thought of him almost creating a rape it turned her on they both climaxed. 'Get something to tie me up with, and then throw me on my stomach forcibly and act out the rape.' She told him.  He smiled because he had always fantasized about raping women. He threw her roughly on her stomach tying her hands and legs. He was getting so aroused he forcibly stuck his hardness into her anally. He was living out his fantasy.' You bitch! Do you like it bitch? I am going to fuck you like this all night.' until he exploded inside of her. The rape being so evil, so brutal turned her on. When he came out of the shower they performed oral on each other. As he lay in the bed next to her he looked at her. 'Did some alien jump in your body? Because if that is the case please don't leave.' He told her holding her in his arms and kissing her passionately.  The witches were to make sure that people noticed the changes in the women. Xavier watched the lawn man Tim, he was tall with muscles rippling all over his body, his head was shaved wearing just a pair of jean shorts with a pair of work boots. 'Well I think an affair or just being a pure slut would be a change in character.' She told her self smiling looking at the lawn mans body. She changed her house dress into a tight white T shirt with out a bra, tight white jean shorts. 'This would be easier if I had a better body to work with instead of lumpy dumpy here.' She told her self looking in the mirror at the body she had to work with now when hers was made for seductions.  Walking to the front door she caught his attention by waving her arm at him. The lawn man jumped off the riding lawn mower running to see how he could help her.  'Come inside for a minute please.' She told him letting him in the house.  'Yes ma'am is there a problem?' He asked trying to avoid looking at her breast through the thin T shirt, but his eyes kept drifting back to her nipples.  'You look so hot.' She told him taking her finger slowly down his chest to the top of his blue jeans just above his pelvic hair stopping then sticking her finger inside of the jeans. 'Am I causing a problem?' she asked him seeing the bulge in jeans growing larger.  'You sure are causing a problem to grow bigger.' He told her watching her taking her shirt off, he took off his boots and pants.  He pulled her naked body up to his, touching areas that were to be forbidden to another man, taking her in front of the door and having hot steamy sex with this sex crazed woman.  The neighbors who were home noticed his truck was there for three hours that day while he was inside having sexual acts done to him that he never even knew existed. Their affair became a weekly thing for them. Between her lovers once a week, her husband every night she had succeeded in conceiving.  The rest of the evil witches conceived shortly after Xavier and continued their affairs with either their Doctors, mail men, who ever they found to do their dirty deed with.  Tom stopped having sex with Xavier once she began showing, her pregnancy was a huge turn off to him. He would go out at night to local bars where he would watch for a woman who left alone, he would follow the victim to where she lived, and for three days he'd watch the apartment making sure his intended victim lived alone. When he knew she was not home he would ring the door bell to see if she had a dog plus checking for any type of security devices.  His first victim was Sally Holt a thirty year old recent divorcee with long red hair, she was average height, weighed one hundred twenty five ponds, brown eyes, her breast were not to large or to big just perfect but what he looked for in his victims was the size of their buttocks, he liked them plump. He left the house with his rape kit which held fake police badge chloroform, rope, and duck tape for their mouths, a brown wig and fake beard in a bowling bag he kept in the trunk of his car. He parked in her guest parking spot next to her car. He got out of his car acting normal, opened his trunk and poured the chloroform on a cloth where he proceeded to her apartment ringing her bell. He could hear her hurrying to the door.  'Yes, who is it?' she asked sounding groggy from just being awakened.  'Detective Branigen, Ms. Holt.' He told her.  'Where is your uniform?' she asked peeking out the peep hole.  'I am a detective we don't wear uniforms.' He told her holding up his fake badge.  'What is wrong?' she asked him as she unlocked the security locks opening the door to him. 'Has something happened to one of my family members?' she asked with a worried expression on her face as she allowed him to come inside shutting the door behind them.  Tom turned towards her seeing that she had nothing on under her robe as it was slightly opened. 'No nothing like that, I am here to rape you!' he told her grabbing her as he placed the cloth over her face until she succumbed to the chloroform.  'I am so sorry to be so late sweet heart.' He told the unconscious woman that he held against his body locking the door behind. 'I see you've been waiting for me.' He told her smiling when her robe fell open exposing her naked body. He carried her to her bedroom laying her on the bed removing her robe. Removing his clothes he laid next to her touching her body, he began kissing her. 'I know how much fore play is important to you my love.' He told her as he placed his finger in her vagina. 'You like that? Look at your body moving so wildly.' He told Sally whose body was lying very still. 'It's time to get ready for the rape scene baby.' He told her kissing her then applying tape over her mouth, turning her over on her stomach tying her arms and legs to each of the legs on the bed.  She began to move, waking from the drug, feeling panic running through her body realizing she was tied up, she felt him massage her from the back. Tears coming to her eyes as she tried to scream but couldn't.  'Now? Ok Sally, you know I love pleasing you right Sally?' He asked her as her eyes showed the terror flowing through her body. No one could hear her muffled screams.  'Harder bitch? You want it harder?!' he asked becoming brutal grabbing her hair and lifting her head up. 'like it Sally? I think I might have another date with you! You fucking whore!' he yelled in her ear as he had his orgasm. He used the chloroform on her again, untied the rope, removing the duct tape then rolled her over on her back caressing her breast kissing her good bye. He left behind a single red rose between her breasts.  Xavier's lover Tim stopped having sex with her at six months of her pregnancy. She ran an ad on the internet looking for men who found pregnant women sexy. The replies were astounding, the first one she met at a motel was a married fifty five year old black man and they had sex for hours. People who knew her saw her going into the motel's with these men. Thinking to them selves poor, poor Tom. Poor, poor Tom was sitting in the bar that night when a woman with shoulder length brown hair, green eyes, wearing a very provocative black dress showing her full bosoms sat next to him, she was drunk and looking for sex. She began to rub his penis smiling at him. He became aroused. 'Come on with me if your want what I have in my pants. Because I want that ass you got.' he told taking her out to his car where he drove to the woods so no one would see them or hear her scream.  'Take your clothes off.' He told her breathing heavy getting out of his pants. He got out of the car pulling her out and pushing her in the back seat on her stomach she couldn't get up, he was already on top of her raping her with brute force as she screamed, screams no one could hear. He then killed her by strangling her to death with her dress, dumping her body out of his car leaving her there to be found by two hunters who just happened to stumble over her decomposed body that had been scattered by the wild animals six months later.  The ninth month.  Tom had managed not to be caught so far for the six rapes he had already committed and three murder's, he sat in the bar in a town fourteen miles away, he struck out with any of the women there so he left when he noticed a black prostitute standing on the corner with large breast and her buttocks was just perfect big and so round. She wore a short shiny silver dress that fit tight across her breast so it would not fall down with matching heels. He pulled the car up to the corner where she leaned in the window.  'What is your flavor tonight?' she asked smiling at him.  'Chocolate get in.' he said getting aroused since this was the first time he had any kind of interracial sex. 'two hundred dollars for everything ok?' he asked her.  'You got it baby.' She told him taking his hand and placing it between her thighs. He was getting excited watching her have a climax. He pulled in to the woods. He was so excited he that he began masturbating watching her turning around in circles naked.  'Come here.' He told her throwing her face down on the hood of the car raping and stabbing her repeatedly in the back. Throwing her on the ground she was barely alive when he raped her laying there on her back, and then in a split second slit her throat so she was dead and he had sex with her dead body for hours. Her body wasn't found for three years when a group of teenagers were out there camping when they saw the human skull.  That night when Tom got home from his killing of the black prostitute Xavier was in labor, she was in labor for six hours at the hospital when she gave birth to an eight pound baby boy. Each witch had theirs before the end of November.  December 24th all the house holds had their families over loving on the babies at three 'o clock in the afternoon they all took their babies to bathe them and instead drowned them all. Each woman walked out into the living where the families were gathered.  'I drowned the baby.' They all said at the exact same time.  All the family members went running to the bathrooms finding the babies floating face down. When they returned to the women they did not remember being pregnant or anything about drowning the babies. Xavier left Toms wife frozen as she stepped out of her in front of him.  'You're so evil raping and killing those women, I'll fuck you when we meet in hell.' She told him with a smile kissing him as she placed his hands on her ass thinking of his evil acts excited her. ' Think I'll come back tonight.' She told him pressing her body hard against his.  The next day the news hit all the papers that an evil phenomenon had occurred on Christmas Eve causing fifty women in fifty states to drown their new born infants. All fifty women were polygraph and they all past the test. They did not have one memory except for being in the churches bathroom almost a year ago. They were tested by experts and they all were telling the truth. They were sentenced to fifteen year's imprisonment and lost any parental rights to any child for the rest of their lives.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© The women who were raped by Tom noticed the resemblance except for the hair and beard; he was pulled into the station where they put him in a line up wearing a fake beard and wig. The women picked Tom out of the line up. There was not one woman with any doubt. He received the death sentence at his trial.  Lillian an evil beautiful lust filled witch wasn't at church long when she spotted a young virgin of twenty two year old named Marla who was taking care of a fifty year old black woman named Thelma who had been comatose for five years with no chance of returning back to the wife that her fifty five year old husband stood by her faithfully. She decided that would be a great scandal and entered the virgin's body.  'You won't be a virgin much longer. 'She told herself looking at the mousy clothes the girl wore. That was something she would change getting back to the house having his baby and killing it. 'Old man I am going to make your small head grow big!' she said to her self.  What turned her on was the girl a virgin and the husband had abstained from sex for five years. She would destroy all that purity.  After church she changed in to a work out suit of a white sports bra that showed her nipples and white tight athletic shorts that revealed she wore a thong and everything else. Mike sat in his recliner wearing a white T shirt and black jeans, his hair was graying, he was heavy built. Mike tried watching television and Marla began to pick up the living room bending over in front of him with her legs spread slightly. He tried looking away only his eyes kept drifting back to her body; he felt an erection and he began to rub it through his pants wanting her so badly. She tripped falling backwards on to his lap. She could feel his erection against her. When he tried he tried to help her up his hands some how ended up on both of her breast. He couldn't fight it any longer, the desire for her raged through his body like an inferno. He kissed the side of her neck while softly caressing her breast; she did not resist his advances.  'Can we go to your bedroom?' he asked slipping his into the front of her shorts & thong feeling her moistness as her hips moved up and down as he touched her.  'Oh yes, yes.' Lillian answered him trying to remember she was a virgin.  As they stood in her bedroom undressing Lillian was pleased with his packaging. Smiling she thought to her self oh that is not a beetle bug, but an eighteen wheeler and I am going to drive it so hard. He laid her on the bed placing his body over hers as he entered her slowly kissing her. Lillian felt the pain of Marla losing her virginity. They made love to each other for hours as he gave her orgasm after orgasm. As many men that Lillian had seduced, she never had one who could make love like he could. Or make her experience oral sex like he did. Well at least he thought it was her first time. She would enjoy sex with him; maybe she would keep him around for her after this was all over.  That night he lay in his bed across the room from his wife. Lillian came into the room wearing a white very thin night gown to give his wife Thelma her medication. Lillian used this as an excuse because the thought of having him while his wife laid there unable to do anything turned her on. Lillian walked to his bed looking in the mirror pulling back his covers she noticed his wife's eyes were watching them in the mirror this excited Lillian even more, she smiled at the woman as she removed her gown watching her husband take her into his arms ravishing her body with kisses and entering her body, and forced to hear their moans from the passion's they were feeling.  She heard her husband tell the woman she thought was Marla he wanted to make her his wife; she has given him the knowledge of what love was. He wanted a child with her; something his wife always denied him to hurt him. And you won't have your little whore either. The woman thought to herself she had been faking her illness.  'I love you and want to marry you.' she told him as he made love to her. 'Let's start making our baby now.' She told him smiling since this was May and the child had to be born before Easter for that was the day she and the other forty nine witches would slaughter their babies.  The other witches in her group were happily seducing the husbands just as the husbands loved being seduced by their wives. And soon their friends and family members would be included in the seductions.  The next morning when Mike woke up he saw his wife sitting on the edge of her bed.' Thelma? Thelma you're alright?' he asked feeling his world crashing around him.  'Yes and that means your little whore will be leaving today.' She told him smiling.' And that means there will be no little bastard child either.' she told him laughing.  While she enjoyed telling Marla she was leaving today and would never have her husband ever again. Mike came back into the room, 'Joe will be here shortly to take you to his place.' He told her sadly.  His wife shot him a hateful look. 'Your brothers? How convenient!' she yelled.' No, I won't stand for it!' she yelled.  'You don't have any say in it!' he yelled back at his wife taking Marla in his arms kissing her passionately running his hands over her tender young body. This was turning Lillian on.  Lillian wanted to come out so bad and blast her, but she had to remain sweet little Marla who would be fucking both brothers.  Joe looked a lot like Mike except he was sixty years old and he lived alone; Lillian wondered if he had equipment like Mike? Time to go exploring she thought to her self. That night as Joe was sitting on his couch in just a pair of boxer shorts. Lillian came out of her bed room wearing just a shirt that covered to her mid thigh.  'I am hot and can't sleep.' She told him running her one hand up her thigh to her stomach showing her nude bottom half of her body. 'you want me don't you?' she asked taking off her shirt walking up to him seeing his equipment was even better. She pulled his boxers off as he was speechless that this young woman wanted him.  'What about Mike?' he asked her becoming so aroused.  'If he really loved me he'd be here with me, not her. Now let's enjoy this time together.' She told him kissing his ear lobes lowering her body over his she straddled him still sitting up, caressing her breast when he really began to get into it forgetting she could become pregnant until after he reached his climax.' Do you have any kind of protection to use against getting pregnant?' he asked her.  'Don't worry about that.' She told him getting aroused again and  They continued in his bedroom until he was tired out.  The next day when Joe went to work Mike showed up. 'She refuses to let me go Marla, what are we going to do?' he asked her.  'Divorce her if you love me and give me the child you promised me we would have.' She told him as she had tears in her eyes.  'I can't, you know our religion does not recognize it.' He told her.  'We committed adultery and our religion does not recognize that either!' she told him becoming more upset forcing his hand at getting rid of his wife how ever he had to do it.  'Baby come here and let me love you.' He told her trying to take her in his arms.  'No not until she is gone.' She told him making him leave the home she now shared with his brother.  Once he had left she smiled knowing he was desperate to have this young body back. He would become insanely jealous when he sees her and Joe eating dinner at the same restaurant he and Thelma would be at tonight.  'Never mess with a naughty witch.' She said out loud laughing. When Joe came in she was wearing a red seductive dress with long sleeves, cut low in the front showing just enough of her breast, a slit up one side to her mid thigh, red heels. Casting the spell on Joe to fall in love with her she was going to start a new family feud. Loving all the tension she was causing.  That night as they were dining Thelma saw Mike getting angry looking at Joe and Marla holding hands, watching Joe touching her thigh. He looked at Thelma knowing because of her he lost the woman who gave him the want to live.' I hate you Thelma.' He told her sipping his wine.  Thelma jumped up from the table walking briskly to Joe and Marla with her glass of wine throwing her wine in Lillian's face. Lillian became angered freezing everyone in motion except for Thelma, Lillian stepped out of Marla's body that was also frozen in place. Thelma had fear pulsating through her body as Lillian grabbed her by the throat.  ' you miserable piece of a mortal! You lay in a bed for five years acting like your comatose, while you torment your husband constantly. I had plans for your death, but that has changed now You will give your husband the divorce and I have other great plans for you.' she told the woman squeezing her neck watching her face turn red to purple.' By the way people like you become the lowest life form of evil after death as a troll, for that is what you portrayed in your life!' she yelled at her knocking her to the ground.  Lillian reversed what had happened where Thelma came charging at the table tripping over her own feet hitting the ground as the glass intended for Marla landed directly on top of her head. Everyone laughed for they knew she had missed her intended victim.  That night after Lillian had pleasured herself with Joe, Xavier showed up after he was a sleep.  'Why are you doing this instead of the way it was planned?' she asked her witch.  'I am causing chaos, making the mother to be look like a tramp, she will be married by the time she gives birth, but I have chosen the evil ex wife to be the killer on Easter day. I will jump in her body at the time to make it happen, I have cast a spell when the old man and girl fall in love, and I will be having a sugar daddy watching while everything goes on.' She told her  'That little bitch better be killed on Easter.' Xavier warned her.  'It's a bastard not a bitch. 'She told her. She conceived the first day.' She told her as both witches smiled at each other.  Mike came over to see Marla. 'I left her last night and got us an apartment so start packing. We will be married right after the divorce is final.' He told her smiling taking her in his arms.  Lillian cast her spell of love on them, stepping out of her body and blending into the furniture. They were happy.  'Enjoy your happiness now my lovers for in a few months you will be in chaos once again.' She said smiling as they had left to start their new life.  When Joe came home to find the long black haired beauty, with pale skin, black eyes, a body you only in see in a sex magazine. She was dressed in a skimpy black dress that hardly covered her large breast. She walked up to him placing his hands on her ass kissing him.  'Who are you?' he asked not trying to stop her.  'I am your new live in girl friend. 'She said licking and sucking his finger. 'We're going to have an orgy tonight with some friends of mine.'  As they walked into the bedroom there were male and female demons, he tried to run, but she slammed the door sealing it so he could not escape not even by the windows. She sound proofed the walls. When she walked up to the largest demon, he was red with horns, a large head, touching him and she began kissing him all over his body then pleasured him while the male and female demons were sexually molesting Joe as he screamed.  'Feast my friends when you are done.' She said smiling as the large demon took her throwing her on the ground.  'I am going to feast now.' He said as he pleasured her.' after they all had ate and not much was left of Joe.  She went to Thelma who was sleeping in her bed; Lillian threw back the covers stripping her of her night gown. Thelma looked scared at the woman.  'I am just going to teach you about sex before we share your body.' She told Thelma kissing her lips as she lay next to her feeling her responding to the lust she had been denying that she was a lesbian, she began to become wild wanting the strange woman in bed with her. She pretended to be comatose so she could have Marla touch her in places then finishing her lust when the girl had left the room. Lillian gave her the sex she had been longing for.  After their session of sex Lillian took over her body joining in on orgies, picking up women in bars, people were talking about the change in her. All the other witches were Pregnant and Lillian was causing as much chaos as she could. Stalking Marla when she was six months pregnant calling her a whore, and home wrecker.  The months were going by fast and before long all the babies were born. Marla and Mike loved their precious son Mathew Joseph.  Easter morning had arrived, Marla and Mike slept soundly until they heard Mathew screaming out in severe pain. Running to his room they found Thelma stabbing the baby over and over they heard his last scream when they knocked Thelma down to the floor.  Marla picked her murdered son up in her arms crying out and the heavens heard her.  'No dear God! Please don't punish our baby boy for our sins!' she cried holding him tight against her body as his lifeless body spewed his blood all over Marla. 'Why? Oh God why?' she cried out as she kissed and held Mathew praying for a miracle.  A bright light appeared in the room. Lillian tried to make her escape but Mystical Lightening and Mystic shadow blew her up.  Mystic shadow, Mystic caster and Flame Caster stood before the infant as mystic lightening shed her tears on him.' Holding the child, she saw all the other murdered infants. 'I mystical lightening grand daughter of Mystic Shadow sprinkle my tears on all the innocent infants caught in the Dark sides evil deeds,  Mystic shadow looked down at Thelma; she knew she made the deal for her soul to the Dark side. 'You sold your soul to kill this child who has never caused you any harm. So I Mystic Shadow the High Priestess of the white light grant your wish to continue your contract with Hell in its fiery lakes is where you and all evil involved in this crime against the innocent are sentenced to for eternity to dwell.' She chanted blowing the woman up along with all the other witches involved in the Easter day slaughter.  Mathew began to cry Mystical Lightening smiled as her tears sprinkled on him.' The Higher Power does not punish the innocent only evil does.' They vanished hearing the infants that were saved crying as they soared around the USA through the air before returning home.  The Dark Side had more evil to dish out on the mortals before their battle with the White Light Warriors in a little over two years. They would cause disasters after disasters to weaken the faith in their God and the goodness of mankind would no longer exist. They would start their own churches, with their own followers.  The New Age Church opened its door's on a bright sunny Sunday morning like every other church people came in mostly out of curiosity. There weren't any crosses or anything of Christianity what so ever. Each person was given a drink before each service called the blessing drink, anything that the Christian churches said was a sin they up held it . More and more people began to join. In six month's the church was becoming so large that the Priest Kevin Damien who was thirty seven years old, blond hair , blue eyes, tall , his charm was almost hypnotic to his listeners. Thought it would be a good cause to purchase land and all of their followers could live on the same land, living and loving together as the creator had planned before man began changing the rules. All the followers signed over their money, property and anything they owned now belonged to the church. They purchased fifty acres of land in Montana far into the wilderness. They built five hundred small houses and a large food hall where they would all cook and eat for the followers, a large house built similar to Grace Land for Kevin whom they all loved and believed in as if he was their God. The Church he had designed was in black with gold trim, inside the walls were even black , the pews were gold, the alter, and light fixtures were gold with specially made bulbs that looked like flames, lights were installed to shine down from the ceiling. At the services he dressed in long black robes with gold trim. His followers never questioned Kevin, they felt he knew what was best for them. The only ones who made trips into town were his trusties who started the church with him. They lived in the mansion with him, certain ones had certain duties to do as head of security, book keeping, and they all shared in on the private bible studies performed in the privacy of the mansion that happened to be their bedrooms. Each one having their own age groups and gender of sex of that they taught, Kevin's was from the age of twelve to twenty five all females Kevin made the bible studies to four times a week, three times a day morning , noon and night Kevin had twenty five of his own. Kevin and his trusties equaled thirty one, fifteen women and sixteen men. They all enjoyed the riches, drove nice trucks and cars to run their errands. Their followers were not allowed to have televisions or radios or read the news papers. The only thing they were allowed to read were the news letter he wrote of the messages that the great powerful one sent to him. Any mail sent to the post office box from other family members were destroyed and answered by one of the trusties as if they were the follower who it was written to. Kevin and his trusties ate only the best of foods prepared by their followers believing that they deserved these foods for they had reached a certain rank and one day the followers would be at that rank when they would expand with more followers. Then they would become a trustee to teach the great powerful ones word and their techniques that they use. Their followers blessing drink increased from once a week at church to once daily when they moved to the land to three times a day.  Kevin's first bible study was twenty five year old Belinda Carson who had been married for two years. She was tall and thin with dirty blond hair; she wore the same long brown short sleeve dress that the other women did. She sat at the table in Kevin's bed room. He began to massage her shoulders.  'You feel so tense, I know I am.' He told her still massaging her shoulders. Suddenly he began to talk to someone in a language that she could not understand. He told her it was tongues and the powerful one wishes us to mate. He helped her from her chair.  'But I am married, wouldn't it be a sin?' she asked him.  Again he began to talk in a strange language. 'He told me to tell you that you are married only to one and that is to me, now as we are all married to each other it is his wish. We are to love one another as man and wife. Who are we to question him after all he has given us?' he asked her holding her chin in his hand. ' now remove your clothing and get into our bed of love.' He told her pointing at the bed.  Tears were filling her eyes as she had never been with any other man except for her husband Michael. She stood before Kevin both of them naked as he touched her breast. She closed her eyes. He grabbed her into his arms kissing her passionately, falling back onto the bed kissing her lips, every inch of her body feeling her become aroused, and her body beginning to move to his touches. He entered her hearing her moan.  'Who are you married to?' he asked her making love to her.  'To you Kevin.' She told him loving the way he made her feel. 'Oh yes to you Kevin.' She said as he made her feel passions that her husband never made her feel in their entire relationship.  Kevin removed her wedding ring from Michael placing a gold band on her finger. 'We just consummated our marriage; you will only sleep with Michael when I tell you to.' He told her going into her deeper and harder.' Tell me do you love me?' he asked as was getting ready to explode into an orgasm.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© 'I love you Kevin, I love you my husband!' she cried out as he gave her the most powerful orgasm.  At the same moment that they sealed their marriage Michael and Tamara consummated theirs placing the identical bands on as Kevin and Belinda. Tamara a tall thin black woman with short hair told Michael the exact same thing. Michael a twenty five year old Italian male who was five feet eight inches tall, stocky build. As he walked out of her bed room Belinda walked out of Kevin's they walked side by side not saying a word to their house. James a pedophile was in his room with eight year old Billy when he began to talk in a strange language. He looked over at the child the powerful one said you must show that you can obey and you must love me by showing me happiness or he will kill you and your family. 'He told the child unzipping his pants and performed sexual acts on the fearful child.  That same day he raped a total of three young boys, one he sodomized, the other two he were made to perform oral on him. That morning thirty one women, men and children were molested believing it was meant to be happening. Fifteen husbands and wives were told not to have marital sex with each other that they now belonged to the trustee they had bible study with.  That afternoon thirteen year old Peggy Sue was sent to Kevin to be his next study where he convinced her that the powerful one ordered him to take her as his wife, placing a band on her finger he then consummated their marriage not paying any attention to her cries from the pain. The women who had young boys placed the bands on their finger too, then consummating their marriages.  That night another bible study group of thirty one followers came into each of the trustee's bedrooms they were to study with. A beautiful young girl named Mya of fifteen with long wavy black hair, blue eyes, and the body that any evil witch of beauty and seduction would be envious of. Talking in the strange language Kevin dropped to his knees in front of the girl grabbing both of her hands smiling up into her eyes. 'You are to be my queen. Tonight we must wed in the church.' He told her. He summons his entire trustees to get her ready to become his queen tonight. That night in the church she wore a black wedding dress with only his trustees & their bible study students were present. The UN holy union was performed by Kevin's second in command. He sliced their hands mixing their blood together, slipping a black & gold band on her finger that began to glow as did her eyes from the mixing of the blood she had become one with the dark side and Kevin. They were married for eternity she let her wedding gown fall to the floor as he undressed and began consummating their marriage on at the alter while the trustees took their bible study child or adult and had sex with them. She was moved into the house with Kevin, he had Trent his second in command to take her to town and dress her as his queen should be dressed. Trent a very large masculine bald man came from an interracial couple, his mother a witch met his father on a plantation where he was a slave giving his soul to the dark side to be freed as a slave to be with his lover Helena the witch of lust. Trent had magical powers, his light green eyes would glow a bright yellow when using the powers of destruction. Trent also wanted the new Queen Mya and this was his perfect opportunity to have her then he would replace Kevin as her husband and the new leader of the Occult.  As they rode down the road in the gold Mercedes he placed his hand on her pulling her brown dress up. Mya spread her legs letting him feel her moistness and letting him know she wanted him just as badly as he wanted her. Smiling he drove to a near by motel, Once inside the room Trent pulled her body against his, kissing her passionately on her lips, neck, caressing her breast, he gently lifted her dress over her head , removing her bra and panties, picking her up in his arms as he gently laid her on the bed kissing her softly on her lips. She watched him removing his clothing from his massive body seeing he was very much aroused by her, he joined her in the bed taking her into his arms kissing her feeling the passion rushing through their bodies as they hadn't as of yet to say a word to one another from the time they left the house. She loved the way he made her body feel the sensual sensations with his kisses softly all over her body, he entered her slowly as their eyes never left contact with one another, moving their bodies in a slow rhythm together until their passions exploded into the most powerful explosion as his seed was planted into her belly.  She lay in his arms feeling safe.' I love you Trent, I don't even like Kevin making love to me.' She told him feeling him tightening his arms around her.  'I promise you that you and I will be wed, I love you and have never loved before. Now I know how my father felt towards my mother.'  He told her kissing her fore head.' Be patient I have a plan.' He told her.  Kevin had lost track of time because he was to wrapped up in the beautiful red headed Nicole, who was very busty, forcing her to give him oral sex over and over when he grabbed her making her sit on top of him moving her hips down on him harder, going into her so deep it was painful. He was becoming frustrated biting into her breast causing her to cry out in pain as tears ran down her face he slapped her so hard she fell to the floor, she could feel him on top of her back and then the excruciating pain as he brutally sodomized the young girl of eighteen, biting her back causing her even more pain. Nicole's screams could be heard by all of the followers and the trustees who smiled knowing he was having sadistic sex with her. When Kevin had finished he picked Nicole up with a brutal force throwing her on the bed as he grabbed her hand placing the gold band on her finger. 'You are my wife now to obey me always.' He told her then performed oral sex on her so her experience wouldn't be to bad for her, causing himself to become aroused again he entered her as they had an orgasm together .  Trent picked out the dresses he wanted his Queen to wear long black gowns cut low in the front exposing most of her breast, with long sleeves, some were sleeveless and backless, all outlined her body, he bought red ones. They all were trimmed in gold, he bought thongs and buster's, spiked heels, accessories for her hair, jewelry diamonds and rubies. He bought her from his own money a ruby, diamond clustered ring. Trent took her hand slipping it on her finger. 'This represents my love to you.' He told her kissing her hand as the female sales clerk smiled at the young couple who were in love. He picked the long black dress with long sleeves to wear home. As they drove home they held hands and he envisioned Kevin raping and beating her. He would end up killing their unborn child she carried which was his. He gently touched her stomach knowing today they made their son. She looked at him curiously wondering why he touched her stomach. Maybe he was thinking of the future.  'Our son is lying inside of his home right now.' He told her smiling.  Mya smiled looking down at her stomach placing both hands on her stomach lovingly looking back at Trent tears forming in her eyes.' our son, we're going to have a son.' She said as she cried tears of joy. 'What do I do to keep Kevin from me?' she asked the thought of another man touching her made her ill.  'Tonight he is going to introduce satanic sex orgies I will manage to be with you.' He told her as he wanted no other man to touch her.  As he thought he knew he had to tell her everything. 'Look my mother was a witch her name was Helena the witch of lust, but she was not evil she was good. My father knowing nothing about witch craft assumed they all were part of the evil. He sold his soul thinking they could be together and he'd be free as a slave. The dark side made a deal and he joined forces with them as a warrior and he would be with Helena forever. My father made the agreement and they brought him back as a powerful demon, they allowed him to marry her and they conceived me, at my birth they cut her throat as he watched them killing her he knew if he reacted they would kill me. They handed me to him; I was raised by witches as my mother's spirit visited me secretly at night making me promise to tell no one. My father just went insane after they killed her becoming their strongest most evil warrior until he met a witch by the name of Mystic shadow; he fell in love with her because she reminded him of his true love. That love bringing the good part out, but her rejection brought the evil insane one out; finally in the end her husband Knight Shadow put him to rest by destroying him forever instead of him being tormented any longer. His demons name was Gore warrior; his mortal name was Otis White that was the last name of the plantation owner who bought him as a slave.' He said looking sad. 'I made a promise and plan on carrying it out.' He told her kissing her hand.  'Why don't I feel the evil flowing through me any more?' she asked remembering her eyes did not glow with him.  'Your true love for me killed the evil.' He explained.' Just stay quiet or we will both be killed.' He told her with a serious look.  When they returned Kevin was waiting in the down stairs parlor. 'Ah my Queen you are beautiful.' He told her rising from the custom made plush black velvet chair taking her in his arms kissing her on her fore head. 'We have to get ready for tonight, for tonight we introduce the drinking of blood and the sexual orgy, Trent you are to be with my beautiful Queen.' He told him because he trusted him whole heartedly.  Nicole sat in her bedroom so her family would not hear her crying, but it was useless her mother & father came into the room. She told them the whole story of the bible study, showed them the bites on her body. They planned to escape feeling they had been caught up in a satanic cult. They heard the bell calling them all to the church UN aware they all had to perform in tonight's rituals. When gave the drink for blessing they had to swallow it or the others may get suspicious. Kevin told everyone that the small cups they were handed to drink that it was the blood of the all powerful one knowing it was the blood of a slaughtered pig. The followers obeyed and drank it as most of them gagged. They then were ordered to stand and remove their clothing for tonight they were to all become one as the trustees matched up couples, men with men , women with women, man with child, woman with child, husbands with other wives, and Kevin picked twelve year old Lilly. When most of the people refused to have sex with the children Kevin brought a six year old boy up holding the child in front of him.  'Because of your disobedience to the powerful one you have just sacrificed this child for him to forgive us!' he yelled as he slit the Childs throat letting his body drop to the floor.  The people screamed as the trustees held machine guns on them. Trent tried to keep Mya calm so Kevin would not find out she was no longer evil. Whispered in her ear.' Act like it does not bother you, smile please baby.' He told her as they sat behind Kevin.  Kevin looked at the people who were filled with fear. ' finish the powerful ones ritual or that three year old girl will be shot dead.' He ordered them.  The followers did as they were told, with the drug taking effect they almost removed their consciousness from their minds to continue on doing something that was not in their beliefs. Mya's tears fell onto Trent's chest as she heard the screams of the children and the men being sexually abused. He quickly cast a spell blocking it out so she would not have to endure it. She sat on top of him looking into his eyes while they made love she was UN aware of the horrible activity happening around her. Kevin attacked the little girl as viciously as he did Nicole earlier. After the orgy was over Kevin ordered that who ever was their partner here was the one they were to go home with and sleep with tonight. He had not finished with Lilly and did not want Mya in his way.  Trent knew now he would be able to take over without any problems and he would do it tomorrow. He sound proofed the house so the sounds of the screams could not be heard. He made love to Mya all night.  The next morning they heard the church bells ringing as they all gathered wondering what could have happened. Kevin stood at the altar with twenty bodies piled up on top of each other, Lilly lying on top.  'The powerful one took Lilly home last night, and the rest of these were people who tried to escape. Breaking the rules of leaving, they were shot down by our security in our towers. No one is leaving here.' He smiled evilly at them. Trent's eyes began to glow as he walked into the church wearing black slacks and a skin tight black muscle shirt dressed as his father did in his life. He walked like a warrior down the middle of the church blowing up Kevin's trustees, machine guns flew threw the air and those who weren't with the white power. As Mya followed behind him she looked at everyone smiling at this massive hero. He pulled Kevin through the air with his powers.  'You sickening mortal, you would not know a demon or a warlock if one was your right hand man! I am half warlock, half demon and my name is Rage warrior the son of Gore warrior and Helena the witch of lust. You have done enough and now you are going to be fed to the one who eats evil souls.' he told Kevin as he hung in the air crying for he really never believed in the demons and witches. He only used the Occult to get rich and use the people for their sick sexual lust. 'Have a nice trip Kevin.' He told him before blowing him up.  He turned to the people.' you can stay or go, but live your lives in the manor of the White Light.' He told them.  They all stayed with him. They made a grave yard burying the victims of Kevin.  Six months had gone by and everyone was happy, they all ate at the large kitchen and turned the house that Kevin lived in to a place where they all could play games and watch movies. They remodeled the other houses with television and radios. Rage warrior even lived in a smaller house with Mya who was growing huge with child.  Wynona, a twenty three year old pretty blond who was very built, she asked if she could speak with Rage warrior that she had a problem, it was not uncommon for the others to come to him with their problems. Once they went inside of her house and he sat on the couch and she straddled him as she kissed him placing his hands on her breast. Rage warrior jumped up from the couch knocking her on the floor.  'My love is for Mya. Don't ever forget it.' He told her walking out.  He told Mya what happened and she kissed him.' what do you expect when you are so handsome and built like a .... ...a.... take me, just thinking about it turned me on.' She told him as they laughed kissing each other.  That night they slept soundly in each others arms dreaming of the day when their child will be born. They truly loved one another totally.  Wynona opened her door smiling.' taking me up on my offer Mr. faithful?' she asked being taken into Rage warrior's arms.  He carried her to the bed where they UN dressed and he ravished her body as she straddled him riding him hard until they climaxed at the exact same moment. Rage warrior held onto Mya as they slept.  The next morning they got up to go have breakfast with the other people, Wynona was sitting at a table by her self smiling at Rage warrior thinking of the great sex they had last night, as Rage warrior and Mya ate breakfast at another table kissing and feeding each other. Mya excused her self to go to the ladies room. Wynona walked past him and leaned over to whisper in his ear. 'The door will be unlocked if you want to come visiting tonight.' She told him smiling walking away.  'Damn girl just doesn't get the message that I don't want her.' He said aloud to him self shaking his head never looking up at her as he ate his eggs and sausage with biscuits.  After breakfast Mya called up car dealer ships to sell the expensive auto mobiles to get more less expensive vehicles for everyone to use.  Rage warrior with some of the other men were making a play ground with the children's help. They built swing sets, slides, two houses with out any rooms for the boy's club house and one for the girl's club house. A little blue eyed girl walked up to him with long blond curly hair, she was only five years old and she tugged on his shirt.  Rage warrior looked down at her smiling.' and what do you wish of me little Miss.?' He asked patting her head.  'Just to tell you thank you for making those bad people go away and stop hurting us.' She told him looking like a little angel.  Rage warrior with tears forming in his eyes picked the little girl up hugging her tightly. 'I promise I will always do my best to protect you and everyone else here.' He told her placing her on the ground watching her run off with the other children.  'Makes you feel good doesn't it?' a strange female voice asked him standing behind him  Turning around he could not believe his eyes standing in front of him was The High Priestess Mystic shadow smiling at him wearing tight black jeans, black boots, a black halter top that had three straps in the back, her hair was pulled up with a clip. He stood looking at her with his mouth open.  'Rage warrior close your mouth it's unbecoming of a warrior.' She told him tapping him on the chin with her finger tips smiling.  'I am just so amazed that you have come here to see us.' He told her realizing she was identical to his mother in every way as she stood with her hands on hips looking around the property. 'You look exactly like my mother.' He told her.  She smiled at him. 'she is my aunt and sends her love to you, my father is Fire caster her brother your uncle, and they both are with the spirit warriors of the White Light. I am here because of what you did in saving so many innocent peoples lives; to let you know that the ones that were murdered all of the adults joined the forces of the spirit warriors.' She was telling him when Wynona ran up placing her self in between her and Rage warrior interrupting what she was telling him.  'Who the hell are you and what do you want?' Wynona asked her in a rude tone.  Mystic shadow looked at her smiling.' Are you the guard dog around here?' she asked her looking at the bleached blond with contempt.  'for your information we are very, very close friends if you know what I mean and I want to know who you are bitch?!' she yelled at Mystic shadow.  'You're crazy; we are not close in anything!' Rage warrior yelled at her.  Mystic shadow looked angrily at Wynona. 'You called me a bitch? No little girl, its correctly pronounced witch, w-I-t-c-h! High Priestess to be exact! and you need an attitude adjustment which I am going to give you.' She told her lifting her in the air spinning her around fast.  'Stop please stop.' Wynona pleaded.  Mystic shadow placed her on the ground watching her trying to stand straight.' See that tree over there?' Mystic shadow asked her.  'Yes why?' she asked feeling sick  Mystic shadow blew it up with her magic. 'You ever disrespect me again and that tree will be you.' She told her firmly.  Mya stood in the back ground smiling watching Wynona running away. She stood silently listening to Mystic shadow talking to Rage warrior.  'I want to tell you thank you for putting my father to rest.' He told her sincerely.  'Your father and I had a love, hate relationship let's just say.' She told him remembering the huge warrior of evil.' any way I am here to help you. You need two schools for the smaller children and the older children.' She told him clearing some property and placing two red school's side by side with grades one through sixth and the other one seven through twelfth, everyone looked at the mysterious woman helping them. 'Two teachers.' She said as two of her warriors appeared. 'This is Sword Caster, and Light Shadow. Both are my warriors who will teach the children, they know how to contact me should the dark side give you any problems, your under our protection.' She told him 'one more thing, that hideous church.' She said as she turned it into a white church with a cross that always glowed. She kissed him on his cheek and hugged Mya good bye and vanished into a sparkling mist.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© The warrior Sword caster was large like Rage warrior with long black hair, blue eyes and a beard, Light Shadow was a petite blond, and her body was very much toned. Rage warrior and Mya introduced them to everyone and the warriors began help fixing and building things with the others.  That night Rage warrior and Mya slept silently as Wynona was awaken by him standing naked over her bed smiling up at him.  'I thought we weren't close?' she asked looking into his glowing eyes.  'shut the fuck up bitch!' he told her sounding so demonic ripping her night gown off of her and taking her with such force that the rougher he was the more she got into it until they reached an explosive climax.  'Why don't you just move in with me?' she asked as he dressed  He turned to her his eyes still glowing. 'You are just my whore, you would never be my queen!' he told her walking out on her as she was angered by his words. Once outside in front of the house he vanished unaware that Nicole had seen him.  Nicole thought it strange since she had never seen him use any of his powers since the day he saved them. She began to run to Mya's and Rage warrior's house looking in their bedroom window they were sound a sleep. Looking around with fear in her heart she ran home.  The next morning Rage warrior woke up feeling to weak to get out of bed. Mya went to get his breakfast and bring it back to him. Wynona saw her walking up to her, she was still mad at being called a whore.  'Where is Rage warrior?' she asked smiling.  'He isn't feeling well today so he is staying in bed.' She told her.  'Wow I must have really gave him a good fuck last night.' She told her patting Mya's belly.  'Your nuts! He was in bed with me all night!' she yelled as she pushed past her taking their food back to their house.  'I bet he fucks me tonight too!' she yelled as Mya was leaving.  Mya had to actually feed him he was so weak, then he fell back to sleep. She would know if he had left in the middle of the night she thought to herself.  That night Rage warrior was back at Wynona's as she performed oral sex on him, he pulled her up on top of him entering her, he caressed her breast, rolling her over on her back where he became almost vicious, he was actually hurting her as he went in deeper and harder until he exploded into an orgasm.  Mya had sat up all night taking care of Rage warrior who was growing weaker, this morning he would not even wake up. Mya ran to the door screaming for help, the people came running. The two warriors appeared in front of her. 'What has happened?' they asked.  'He won't wake up!' she cried fearing she was losing him.  They pushed past her finding Rage warrior lay almost lifeless in the bed, they quickly summoned Mystic shadow.  Mystic shadow looked at Rage warrior knowing his life was being drained from his body. 'When did he get like this?' she asked Mya.  'He has been in bed since the night before last.  'He was pretty alive in my bed last night.' Wynona told them as she stood behind Mya.  Mya turned to Wynona with a look that could kill. 'you just won't give up will you? I sat up all night with him! With a wash cloth on his fore head!' Mya told her breaking down crying.  'If it wasn't him then who was it?' she asked looking scared  'I saw someone the other night leave your house and vanish, I thought it was Rage warrior too but I looked in their bedroom window he was sleeping.' Nicole told them softly.  Mystic shadow knew it was him killing him self. She summoned Guardian caster. 'The demon is trying to kill him to take over thinking he will be in control. 'She told her.  'He will be in control.' She told her as she quickly made a potion to cure him when the evil Rage warrior appeared.  'It won't work he is going to die as you see I am here and strong while he lies there dying.' He told them laughing.  'Wrong he is still breathing while you are out of his body.' Mystic shadow told him.  Suddenly in a swift powerful move he grabbed her.' I see now why my father loved fucking you.' He told her holding her tightly against him as the potion was administered to Rage warrior, the evil one vanished with Mystic shadow before anyone knew what had happened.  He stood holding her body tightly against his, kissing her, she was helpless against him. 'We're in my new dream world and I have powers see.' He told her as he blew up a rock.' And in my dream you want me, want to please me, love me.' He said ordering his dream to begin.  They were in a large bed as he kissed her passionately; he turned more and more demonic, she knew it was that he wanted her to love him in his dream and she had to do something to break his concentration. She cried out for Knight Shadow before he had he could rape her. By breaking his concentration it allowed Knight Shadow in to the dream. 'Hey asshole that is my wife!' He yelled getting the demon away from Mystic shadow.  'She is going to be my fuck for now.' Rage Warrior yelled sending Knight Shadow across the room into the wall.  'Knight Shadow! 'Mystic Shadow cried out watching her husband battle this huge demon.  Knight Shadow saw that his sleeve had ripped. 'Now you went and did it!' he yelled blowing up Rage warrior  'What about the good Rage warrior?' she asked.  'He is worried about his beautiful cousin.' He told her smiling.' And no more demons ok?' he told her kissing her.  'You're so funny; ha ha ha , but keep your warrior job though.' She told him as they vanished  That night as Wynona was sleeping two green scaly hands with long claws ripped her through the bed, she has never been found.  Rage warrior was completely well now and Mya delivered a healthy nine pound baby boy named Mystical warrior in honor of his cousin for saving his life. The fairies and all the warriors gathered to view the baby.  There were female warriors placed on the land to protect the child and mother against the Dark Side attacking them. Rage warrior knew just before the war was to break out he would have to move them and the other women with small children to safety with Mystic shadow. The people were making preparations for the day when good vs. evil making weapons that they could use, potions to use against the evil, crosses that were specially made by Guardian Caster they would project a shield around the wearer who was being attacked.  The world was showing signs of the approaching war, young children being taken and never found, children killing and raping other children, teenagers killing friends, teacher's family, and strangers just walking down the street. Drugs made by the Dark Side were moving through the world like wild fire. Men and women raped every thirty minutes of the day. The law enforcement was amongst those giving into the Dark Side killing good officers who would not agree with their tactics, raping the citizens they pulled over or the ones they had locked in their cells, brutally beating and raping of female officers, killing them so savagely and scattering their body parts all over so they could never be properly buried to rest in peace. There were acts of terrorism across the world killing innocent people, world leaders trying to win against the terrorist.  These were the signs that in the next year and a half the final war would take place here on earth between good and evil.  Linda Green a twenty six year old female had been with the police force for two years, she wore her blond hair short, her body was firm from working out, she was tall, her green eyes that showed the goodness in her soul. She wore her black uniform and Police badge with pride. Tonight she was working the grave yard shift when she got a call that an alarm was going off in some ware houses on the west side of town. Pulling in to the ware houses she had a funny feeling when she saw an opened bay, she radio in she was going to go check it out. She slowly got out of her patrol car with her flash light and gun in hand. She slowly walked up the bay shinning the light inside of the open bay, but she saw nothing, moving in slowly and carefully she moved to the center of the room looking around when a net fell on her knocking her to the ground due to the weights attached to it making it heavy and her gun slid across the floor. She struggled to get free when she saw four of her fellow male officers. They were all dressed in black shirts and black slacks.  'Ok you can let me up now, you've had your fun.' She said getting on her hands and knees.  'Now that is the position I like seeing women in on their hands and knees.' Lionel Washington said smiling a black male, six feet four inches tall, heavy set, a twenty year veteran with the police force he was just made sergeant.  The men grabbed her up off the ground carrying her still in the net taking her to a car they had in the back and putting her in the trunk. She tried struggling against them, but could not get free because of the net.  'Stop! This isn't funny any more!' she yelled at them looking at her brother's best friend Leon Jackson who had been on the police force for three years, a black male. He stood five feet eight inches tall, muscular build; he could not look her in the eyes.  'Well it's going to be real fun for us! Let's just say you're the guest of honor.' Harvey Lugetti said laughing, he was Italian with a wife and six children, he'd been with the force for twenty years and a detective of homicide. He's heavy set, five feet eleven inches tall with black hair and mustache.  'Please why are you doing this to me?' she asked crying as the realization was they were serious in what ever they had planned for her.  'Lets just say I got tired of watching you tease me working out and turning me down like I wasn't good enough for you!' Danny Billings told her, a white male, blond hair, blue eyes, six feet two inches tall male, ten years with the force, her work out partner.  'It wasn't me; it was the policy of the police force.' She told him crying as she tried to get out.  'Rules are made to be broken.' Danny told her slamming the trunk shut.  To her it felt like they had been driving for hours when they finally came to a stop. They pulled her out of the trunk she could see they were at a cabin in the woods, they dragged her inside with the net still on her until they put her in a room that had chains hanging from the ceiling with hand cuffs attached to them against the wall, the bed had chains and shackles to hold a person there. She saw whips, chains and branding irons, a chain saw in the corner. As she looked at the floor she saw old blood stains.  'No! oh God no please!' she cried as she began struggling when Lionel Washington hit her so hard with his fist directly on her nose shattering it, the force was so hard it knocked her out.  Waking up she was nude tied to the bed with them all naked standing around her looking at her laughing.' Ok Leon she is awake prove to us your one of us.' Lionel told him shoving him in the bed with her.  Leon began raping her, blocking her screams and cries out of his mind; his eyes closed not wanting to see her bloody face from her broken nose. Once he was done he got off of her feeling sick, but not letting the others see it bothered him. Danny was next as he raped her, he would punch her in her face until her face was bloodied and swelling. The others were just as brutal with her hitting her so hard knocking her teeth out of her mouth, Harvey cut her nipples off as she screamed out a blood curdling scream. As the men pulled her up from the bed to chain her to the wall she looked them all directly in their eyes with the hate and contempt she felt for all of them.  'I promise you all this, I will return from death and kill every one of you! I beg of the power above to grant me this request.' She said before her head slumped over as the Higher Power took her before they could enjoy anymore of their torture on her.  The men felt an eeriness by her words, instead of cutting her up they cleaned up the evidence that could link them to her murder, they washed her out so no traces of their sperm could be detected, wiping her body down so no finger prints could be picked up off of her skin, they knew how to clean up their tracks. They placed plastic in the trunk of the car, wrapping her up and dumped her not far from the ware houses knowing the other officers were looking for her as they listened to the police radio. They cleaned any trace of her hair on them or the car. They were silent as they rode back hearing her promise to them over and over, how she suddenly died as if some force had put her out of her suffering. When Lionel looked in the rear view mirror he saw her running naked and bloodied and battered down the high way after them. Lionel eyes got wide as he slammed on the brakes throwing everyone forward in the car.  'The fucking bitch is a live! Look she's coming down the road!' he yelled as he saw her coming faster and faster after them.  The others looked behind them; they only saw a dark lonely road. 'Man your nuts there isn't anything there.' Danny told him.  'Let's go man before one of the other officers spot us out here and start asking questions.' Harvey told Lionel getting edgy by all of this weirdness.  That night they each dreamt of her calling them to her then she would be right in front of them all bloody, her nipples gone and dripping blood from the open holes, grabbing them and kissing them with her bloody toothless mouth, her face swollen and bruised almost unrecognizable as a human face.  The next day they heard her body had been found, they even requested to be the ones to find the perpetrators of their fallen sister. At her viewing her family requested an open casket so everyone would know what she had gone through, she had appeared in a dream to her mother asking her not to close the casket, she did not want her death to be in vain, she wanted everyone to know what they did to her.  Her family sat in the front pew of the funeral home listening to the gasp when friends and family saw her face, she was dressed in her police uniform, Leon walked slowly to the casket not wanting to see what he and the others had done. He looked down into the coffin only he saw her nude with out nipples as the blood gushing out of the holes; suddenly she jumped up at him grabbing him by the throat when he started screaming. Her brother Lewis ran up to him placing his arm around him to calm him down.  'Hey that's just a shell laying there she is up in heaven.' He told him as he tried to comfort his friend.  Leon realizing she wasn't strangling him, she was in her uniform. Tears coming to his eyes.' Oh man this is so wrong.' He said under his breath, he then pushed Lewis away and ran as fast as he could to his apartment. The other three men thought she opened her eyes with that same look in her eyes before she died. Leon walked back and forth in his eighth floor apartment when he saw her nude and bloody.  'Want me now Leon?' she asked as she kept walking towards him.  'I swear I didn't want to do it! Linda I swear!' he kept telling her as she walked slowly towards him, he kept backing up towards the balcony.  'Bull shit you didn't want to do it! You sure as hell didn't try to save me either!' she yelled at him with a look of hate on her disfigured face that she would make sure he would remember it even in death.  She started running at him screaming that blood curdling scream she screamed that night, he turned running as he kept looking back at her she was getting closer, he had to get away from her when he crashed through the balcony railing falling to his death.  'I didn't mean that either.' She said smiling down as the spirit warriors of the white light carried his screaming insane soul to hell.  That night as Harvey and his wife Wendy were having sex with her on top of him, she was a pretty petite blond, with breast implants, he opened his eyes seeing Linda was on him bloody and gory kissing him smearing her blood all over his face. His face bore the face of fear before death.  Wendy seeing her husbands face all distorted thought he was having a heart attack. 'What's wrong Harvey? Don't you like the way I am doing it tonight?' he heard Linda ask him.  'Linda!' he screamed full of fear trying to get away from her kisses.  He began screaming throwing his wife to the floor knocking her out when Linda came climbing up on to the bed from the floor smiling at Harvey, he began screaming louder trying to get out of the bed when his heart exploded hearing Linda's laughter was the last thing he took with him to his death where he would hear it over and over as his soul was carried off to hell.  Linda looked back at the woman sadly who was still knocked out. 'I did you a big favor, you just don't know.' She said vanishing.  When Wendy came to she found him dead with the look of fear on his face as if it was the devil him self he had seen. The police and paramedics arrived with the chief of police Raymond Richardson trying to figure why did two of his officers die in the same day as if they were in fear of their lives? He was a tall, thin muscular build man in his early fifty's, he was bald on top with gray short hair in the back, grayish blue eyes, he was a fair good hearted man.  'I know this is a terrible time for you Wendy, but can you tell me what happened?' he asked her.  She began crying wiping her tears from her face with both hands.  'We were making love and all of a sudden he began acting like he was trying to get away from something. I remember now he called out Linda's name then threw me to the floor so hard I was knocked out. By the time I came to he was already dead with that horrible look on his face.' She told him breaking down again.' He was a good man! We were going to go on our second honey moon next week.' she cried into her hands.' Oh Harvey why did you have to leave me for?' she cried as they moved his body out on a stretcher.  The chief of police wondered to him self why both men were heard screaming out Linda's name at their death's. Leon's neighbors told them he was heard screaming the name Linda. Were they some how involved with her murder? He asked him self. He decided to remain quiet until he could get to the bottom of it.  The two remaining men who were still alive met at a near by park where both were visibly shaken up. Lionel's hand was shaking as he tried to drink his coffee. Wishing he could turn back the hands of time, that they had not picked her as the victim. Knowing he was going to die and was helpless to stop it from happening.  'Man she is keeping her word, she fucking told us she would come back from death to kill us.' He said getting tears in his eyes, not that he was sorry for what he had done, but he was scared for him self.  Danny looked at the ground.' The way she just died after she made that promise, it was as if something removed her so we couldn't finish cutting her up while she was still alive.' Danny said as he thought of those powerful words that she spoke that he kept hearing some times so loud he could hardly bare it.  'Want some doughnuts boys with your coffee?' Linda asked standing behind the bench they were sitting on holding her nipples in her hands dripping blood from her face and where her nipples once were.  Both men jumped up and started running as fast as they could as the female officer Nancy watched them running from the two glazed doughnuts she held in her hands they acted as if they were scared of the doughnuts. Shrugging her shoulder's she sat on the bench. She finished drinking her coffee and eating the two doughnuts. The two men ran until they could not run any more.  'We need to get to work before we're missed.' Danny told Lionel trying to pull him self together.  While Lionel sat at his desk he was beginning to feel better and decided he would go check out a murder scene of a prostitute, her body had been found in a saw mill severed into pieces and of course she was one of their victims as they scattered her remains all over town. The saw mill had been closed until they were through investigating the case which would go unsolved. As he walked through the mill he heard the saws start up. No one is suppose to be here damn it! He thought to him self as he went to check out the reason for the saws going. He looked around and saw no one there. Looking around he saw Linda standing behind him.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© 'Please Linda, please I am sorry for what happened.' He told her turning around trying to walk back wards to get away from her.  'Take your clothes off now or I will saw you in half!' she told him with that same look on her face as she did the night she made the promise.  He tried to run to escape her, but she appeared in front of him. 'Ok, ok, I'll take them off.' He told her as he removed his clothes standing in front of her nude.  A small saw blade flew through the air removing his penis. He began screaming as he looked at his penis on the floor, the blood was squirting out like an oil well had been struck with each one of his heart beats. He tried to stop the bleeding with his hands as she walked towards him.  'It was too small any ways to do any woman any good. A pickle would be better than that pitiful thing.' She told him taunting him as he was growing weak from losing so much blood.  He kept walking backwards trying to get away from her as his heart pound faster and the blood squirted even faster when he fell back wards on to the large saw cutting him self in half. Her name appeared on the floor by his penis wrote in his blood. She wanted everyone to know they had been the ones who had raped, murdered and mutilated her body.  'Burn in hell with your other two buddies for Danny will be joining you three goons very soon.' She told his corpse smiling.  Danny was true to his nature at the gym where most of the police officers used to work out, he was working out on the weight bench when she straddled him holding the three hundred fifty pounds weights across his throat watching his face turning purple as she smiled down at him.  'Linda, stop please! I am sorry!' he was able to yell out.  Everyone looked at Danny forcing the weights down on his own throat like he was begging someone to stop, but he was the only person there.  One of the other guys working out ran over pulling the weights off of him. 'Man you on drugs or something?' he asked Danny.  Danny looking petrified at the man, 'Linda is trying to kill me for what we did to her that night!' he told the guy looking around the room scared to death, then he looked like he saw Linda who was not there.' I am sorry we killed you, I am sorry we raped you! Is that what you want to hear an apology? I am fucking sorry!' he cried out as everyone looked at him hearing the confession that he took part in Linda's murder.  Shaking her head no, she walked towards him with the same look just before she died. 'Don't you want my rotting flesh now to fuck?' she asked pulling off the remaining part of her right breast throwing at him.  'No, no!' he yelled terrified running out of the gym looking back and seeing her chasing him, his heart was pounding in his ears, he had a wild gaze about him, he was so petrified he ran into the path of a eighteen wheeler killing him instantly, the rig was properly named HELL BOUND!  She smiled watching the spirit warriors take him away knowing that everyone now knew the truth that they were her murderers. She knew there were more Police officers just as corrupt and evil as they were. She turned into a gold glittering mist flying towards heaven. The Chief of Police closed the case of Linda Green. He hung a plaque in her honor hanging with the other fallen officers; even in death you caught your criminals. He thought to him self as he looked at her picture that reminded him of an angel.  The next day when he past her plaque someone had stuck a close up shot of a picture of her from the crime scene. 'My God when is it going to end?' he asked aloud.  One of his officers walked past him. 'You honor that bitch dishonoring men who were here for twenty years!' Juan Garcia said to him looking at him with hate., he was a young Hispanic officer in his early thirties, tall and slim build.  'And since when is it company policy to honor murderers and rapist?' The chief of police asked him.  Juan looked at him dumb founded with out an answer to his question as every one looked at the two men. The chief took her crime scene picture off her plaque.  'If you do not like the policy here to 'Serve 'and to 'Protect' then perhaps you should turn your gun and shield in right now, and that goes for anyone else who doesn't like the way Linda Green was honored and remembered here.' He said as he looked in to each one of his officer's eyes.  He went to his office remembering when officers were on the good side. Remembering a sign, he had seen in one of the Broward county crime commission offices. 'Evil Triumphs When Good People Stand Idly By.' He said aloud to him self  A new female officer Casey Blackstone had been hired two week's after Linda's murder. Casey a thirty six years old, half her of adult life was in law enforcement. Since she was eighteen years old , her hair was so black it cast a blue haze, she was five feet eight inches tall, her weight was one hundred forty pounds, brown eyes, she was a 6th degree in marital arts, she had been trained to serve in the special tactical unit for six years. The chief of police had requested for her to be transferred to his unit. Her files had been touched up so that no one would know what she really was and why she was here. The chief felt there were a lot more evil cops then good.  As the chief showed her around the other officers watched her, the male officers who were corrupt smiled as they thought to them self's rookie and would put her through the mill.  Casey Blackstone's first day on the job, as she was walking down the hall she passed a group of male officers as they were making comments about who would be the first one to fuck her. Casey turned around smiling at them. 'Aren't you officers of the law and not high school thugs?' She asked them smiling sarcastically at the men.  The female officers stood still holding their breaths, they feared these men. Mitch Danielson enraged by her disrespect to them walked up to her quickly grabbing her by the back of the hair to slam her face first into the wall when she reversed it on him, he ate the wall and then she sent him to the floor with her black police issued shoe on his throat.  Her teeth clenched looking down at him.' Touch me again; I will not hesitate to snap your fucking neck! Is that under stood Officer Danielson?' she asked him, as his face was turning red.  The other five men decided to help him by charging at her when they found them selves flying through the air, crashing into walls and Dave Smith hitting the chief's door.  'what is going on out here?' he asked them seeing six of his male officers on the floor, the female officers smiling, Casey standing with her hands on her hips.  'Nothing sir they were welcoming me to the department I guess you could say.' She told him with an ear to ear grin.  He smiled at her knowing he had made the right choice.' Ok well since everything is under control I'll go back to my paper work.' He told her closing the door.  She looked at the men on the floor smiling.' Anytime you boys want a rematch let me know.' She told them smiling  Dave Smith looked at the other female officers smiling at them for once a woman put them in their place.' What the fuck are you bitches looking at?' he asked angrily.  Casey turned back to him hearing what he told the women. 'Officer Smith those women are law enforcement officers just as you, treat them as equals and I will treat you as my equal.' She told him looking him dead in the eyes as her eyes looked almost coal black at that moment. The other men saw her eyes as well and felt the cold blast of fear run through their veins. Watching her walk away with an air about her they could not explain.  Casey was on patrol as she drove through the warehouse's where they had grabbed Linda that night, she stopped directly in front of the bay door that had been opened that night, she looked at the door her eyes turning black realizing she was being fired upon. Dropping into the front seat she radio dispatch.' Officer under fire.' She said.  'Are you really Casey?' she heard the voice of Mitch Danielson returning her dispatch. 'Wonder who is firing on a nice officer like you?' he asked taunting her.  'Hey Mitch, I hope your there when I come back in to the station.' She told him as the shots were getting closer to the car; she lay on the floor board. 'enjoyed the convo asshole, but I have to go.' She told him grabbing her gun.  The five officers walked up to the car shooting at it with their riffles. When they looked in the car windows she literally blew Ron Traylor's face off. When the other men saw him go down they got even more angered as they started shooting inside of the car.  'Hey moron's behind you!' She said now wearing a black T shirt that had the words 'HIGHER POWER' in white letters, black combat fatigues, black army boots, and their rifles went flying through the air.  They looked frightened at her. She walked slowly towards them.  'What the fuck are you?' Dave smith asked as they began to walk back wards.  'I am Linda Green, I am Maria Lopez, I am Frank smith, I am Paul Edgar's, 'she told them as she transformed into each victim freezing them so they could not move as they tried to run, the men were scared of this woman or thing.  'Those are only a handful of victims your evil club has claimed in death or rape. I am a special tactical unit warrior of the Higher Power sent here to send your evil souls where they belong and one guess, its not earth, ok one more it has four letters starts with H ends in L. 'She told them smiling.  'There's too many of us for you to stop every one of us, we are all over the country.' Dave told her smiling.  'I have fourteen months left to do my job before the end.' She told them then without warning blew them all up in a blaze as the spirit warriors took their screaming struggling souls to hell. She left the car sitting in the drive way.  She appeared behind Mitch who was trying to sexually assault a young female officer in the men's bath room. She grabbed him by the back of his shirt throwing him against the wall so hard it made a loud thud sound. The female officer stood in the corner with her shirt and bra ripped open crying, she was thankful that Casey came in when she did. He charged at Casey looking like a crazed animal when she froze him too.  'What the fuck?' he asked as he could not move looking at the woman in black combat wear.  'What's the matter don't like feeling helpless? I am sure Linda Green, Sarah Thomas, Lindell Jameson, Fanny Carson, Mike Danielson your brother, didn't like it either.' She told him transforming into each person as she named off more names of victims with Linda's first.  He looked at her scared knowing she was not human, the other woman stood with tears in her eyes for she knew she had to be some sort of angel sent here to save them.' thank you God.' She said with her hands folded crying and looking up.  'I am in the special tactical unit of the Higher Power and you are joining your evil buddies in hell.' She told him blowing him up. She smiled at the woman.' He told me to tell you, you are welcome.' She told her and turned going out the door.  She summoned every evil officer in this town and state to appear before her as she stood in the parking lot of the police station. Over one hundred officers appeared not one of them could move as she named over a hundred names including small children that were their victims as well. The good officers stood watching as the evil ones were screaming. They watched her transform into the victims.  'I am in the special tactical unit of the Higher Power and you all are invited to join your evil buddies in hell.' She told them smiling as they blew up.  All the Officers stood smiling at their heroin sent to them from heaven. Casey walked up to Chief Richardson hugging him and kissing him softly on his cheek.' I was told to answer the question you asked the Higher Power before my arrival here, he said it has ended now.' She smiled as his eyes were tearing up as he remembered standing at Linda's Plaque taking the crime scene picture down.  Casey turned to the rest of the officers. 'Remember we are here to 'Serve' and to 'Protect' but you need to ask for our help before it's gone too far.' She told them smiling as she vanished into a gold sparkling fog.  Casey went from state to state revenging the crimes against law enforcement officers and citizens committed by the corrupted officers. In less then six months she had achieved her fight. Eight months were left before the war was to break out.  Mystic shadow, Knight Shadow and their warrior's trained every day, the twins training even harder to build their powers to magnitudes so the Dark Side would not stand a chance. The officers who gave their lives on earth were made warriors for the spiritual warriors.  Crimes on earth were now growing in forms of terrorist acts using biological war fare, the teenagers of the USA had grown more violent and protected from punishment of their parents by an agency arresting the parent and removing the child into worse situations then the supposed abuse and ignoring the true cases. This is what evil wanted, to turn everyone evil.  Leanne Wilson a ten year old white female decided she did not want to live by her parents Foster and Sara Wilson's rules set up at home, being in the house by six in the evening, having to do home work or chores, much less having to go to school at all. She wanted to hang out with the kids in her neighborhood wearing clothes that a prostitute would wear after she left her home in her normal clothes. She began drinking alcohol, smoking, doing drugs, having sex with a fifteen year old boy. One night she didn't come home at all staying at the boy's house, her parents frantic that some sex crazed maniac had taken their little girl. They searched, the police searched for her, but no one could find her. Leanne came home the next morning still high on cocaine, hickies all over her body. Her parents grounded her to her room for one month only to come out to eat, go to the bathroom and to go to school where the school would inform them when she was not there. Leanne became enraged with her parents taking an electrical iron and burning her own upper left arm and called the police to report her parents were abusing her; she was removed from the home even though this happened when both parents were at work, they still removed her putting her in a foster home ran by Charles and Wilma Seedily with six other foster children. The man and wife let the kids do as they please, they only cared about the three hundred dollars a month the state paid them for taking the children in their three bedroom home where four girls shared one room that had two sets of bunk beds with two dressers to share . The two boys shared the other room, but always seemed to sneak two girls in their room at night having sex. Their ages were two fourteen year old males; the girls were thirteen, twelve and two ten year olds.  After a month in the foster home the husband began abusing the children, the older ones escaped by sneaking out the window. The only ones left were Leanne and Missy who were both ten years old and beaten if they told anyone what really happened. When his wife was gone or sleeping he would then take the two girls making them join him at one time. He was high one night on cocaine; the foster parents were never drug tested through the agency. He raped Leanne by sodomizing her and she died by being ripped apart and bled to death in her bed. They told the police she must have slipped someone in during the night, she was a wild child and hard to handle. Nothing was done to him.  Timothy Kenshaw a senior in high school, tall, blond hair, blue eyes, he had the looks and charm of a male model, he was a well liked and a popular student at school. He began to become moody and violent towards everyone, he lived with his mother, a fifty year old invalid in a wheel chair, he was a loving son helping her reach things that she could not since the horrible accident that caused her paralyses and the death of his father who was driving home drunk from a family gathering. Timothy came out of it with a few bumps and bruises. This particular evening was different though when she asked him if he would get her a can of green beans down for her just as she had done a number of other times in the past.  He turned around so full of rage.' I can't stand you old woman!' he yelled grabbing the green beans out of the cupboard.  She looked at him startled by his reaction towards her when he began bashing her in the head with the can over and over.' Here's your fucking can of green beans mother!' he yelled finally stopping when there wasn't any more life left in her body. Turning around wiping the can off calmly sitting it down on the counter top he went up stairs removing his clothes and placing them in the metal container he used to store old clothes in. he carried the container to his car parked in the garage placing the container in the trunk, he called his aunt playing a recording of his mother in the back ground asking him if he would help her move her wheel chair into the family room so she could watch television while he was out.  'Just a moment please Aunt Sharon.' He said into the receiver. 'Just a moment mother I am speaking with Aunt Sharon.' He said as if he was talking to her. 'Mother sends her love, I will be there in about an hour and please don't worry I don't mind helping you moving the couch.' He told her smiling since his aunt lived in the next town that was a good hour's drive.  As he left the house he honked the horn as he always did saying good bye to his mother. He drove until he came to an abandoned house that sat way back in the woods and only fifteen minutes from his Aunts setting the container on fire and the house as if bums were staying in it trying to stay warm. He quickly left the house so he would not smell of smoke. He stayed at his aunts for an hour talking and laughing, he called the house but there wasn't any answer.  'She isn't answering, I better go maybe she has fallen and can't get to the phone.' He told his aunt looking worried that his mother may be injured.  'Should I call the law to have them go by and check on her as well?' she asked him.  'Yes it will be at least an hour to get there from here.' He told her kissing her good bye on her cheek, hurrying to his car worried that his poor mother had fallen.  'What a good boy he is.' Sharon said who was twenty years older then her sister, white hair, slightly bent over wearing a light blue dress, a white belt, support stockings with beige shoes that laced.  When Timothy arrived at his and his mother's house there were police all around and the coroner's wagon. He jumped out of the car running to the house panic stricken.' Mother! Mother! Mother!' he yelled as Officer Riley stopped him from going in the house.  'Tim wait, son she isn't with us anymore.' He told him as Tim fell to the ground crying hysterically having losing both parents and both were horrible deaths.  'Oh God it's my entire fault! I should have stayed home with her, what happen? Did she fall out of her chair?' he asked Officer Riley with a tear soaked face full of pain and grief.  Officer Riley age fifty two, salt and pepper hair, heavy set, five feet eleven. Gray eyes. He had known the family all of his life, they played together as kids, went to school together and he was Tim's father's best man. He looked up at the sky as tears appeared in his eyes. Shaking his head he tried to control his voice from cracking.  'Timmy somebody killed her.' he told the boy.  Tim looked shocked. Confused. 'Killed her, why? Who? Who would kill her?' he asked looking at the officer.' Where is she?' he asked crying.  'Inside Timmy, but let me warn you it is horrible.' He told him as they walked into the house slowly.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© She was laid in a body bag on a stretcher, he walked up to it crying as he looked at the black bag. He reached for the zipper when Officer Riley grabbed his hand.  'Wait Timmy, her head was bashed in so bad that her brain is literally showing.' He told him to prepare him for what he was going to see.  Timmy slowly opened up the bag screaming out in agony.' Momma!' he cried falling over the bag holding it crying.' why oh momma why?' he cried as the officers watched the poor boy crying over his mother.  Standing up trying to pull him self together.' What did they use an ax?' he asked.  'No we found her still sitting in her chair in the kitchen where the perpetrators used a can of green beans.' He told him feeling he had nothing to do with it.  'A can of green beans did that? When I left I put her in the living room she was going to watch television until I got back from Aunt Sharon's. If I had just stayed home she would be alive!' he told Officer Riley as he watched them remove her body from the house. Finally the bitch is gone. He thought to himself.  'Why don't you stay somewhere else tonight Timmy?' Officer Riley asked him.  'No I am going to stay here; she'd still be alive if I had stayed home to protect her.' He told him  'It's not your fault, how would you know some maniac was going to break in here and do this? I just can't figure out why he or she would take her in the kitchen to kill her with a can?' he asked watching Timothy walking through the house crying as he looked at his mother's things sitting around the house.' who knows what the perpetrator did or thought there is never any logic to murder.' He said feeling sorry for the young boy.  That same night Nancy Stevens age sixteen sat in her bedroom combing her long black hair, wearing a red silk night gown, she had a perfect figure for her age she was Polynesian and American and wanted sex tonight. Her mother was out of town for the week while her step father slept in the room next to hers. Larry was in his forty's but she didn't care she needed to be full filled, she tip toed to his room opening the door slowly seeing the tanned construction worker with light brown hair, he was tall and his body was firm and she wanted what he had. He was sleeping on his back in the nude without covering him self as she walked up to the bed dropping her gown to the floor then she sat on top of his body as he opened his eyes.  'Nancy? What?' he tried asking but she began kissing him.  She placed his hands on her breast he gave into the lust of this sixteen year old girl kissing her back seeing she was very experienced in sex.  They had sex all night as he gave her sex with a man she had never known. They both stayed home from work and school finding out she was more experienced in oral sex then her mother was. They never bothered to dress that day. She slept with him in her mother's bed for the rest of the week. When her mother returned she was jealous to see them being affectionate to each other. She listened to their moans that night lying in her bed drove her crazy with jealousy. The next morning as she was dressed in a very short black skirt, a red half top with out a bra on, with knee high boot's, she made sure she came down when he was in the kitchen while her mother was in the shower.  'Where are you going dress like that?' he asked angered by her attire.  'Well I see I am no longer needed around since moaning mommy is back.' She said snidely.  He grabbed her by the arm pulling her body up to his running his hands up her shirt kissing her, then up her skirt feeling she had nothing on backing her into the laundry room when he undid his pants pushing her against the wall as he had sex with her the thrill of getting caught turned him on even more. Just as they both reached an orgasm they heard her shutting off the shower.  'I love you Larry, I want it to be just us again. Let's leave.' She told him kissing his neck.  'I love you too and I am leaving, but for work.' He told her kissing her.' Change those clothes; I don't want other guys to see what is mine.' He said grabbing her by her ass and squeezing as he left for work.  She watched her mother hatefully as she poured her coffee.' So how did you and Larry get along?' she asked sipping her coffee paying her daughters outfit not one bit of attention.  'We got really close.' She told her smiling.  'Good because tonight I am telling Larry we are having a baby.' Her mother Marie told her feeling happy that she was pregnant by her husband.  'Pregnant? You're pregnant by Larry?' she asked angrily.  'Yes, I didn't think you would mind having a little brother or sister.' She told her as Nancy stormed out of the house. He's mine she thought to her self running out to the street.  Knowing her mother would be home alone Nancy snuck back into the house finding her mother a sleep on the couch. Going quietly to the kitchen she grabbed the butcher knife and put on a pair of rubber gloves then going back to the couch where she plunged the knife into her mother's stomach over and over. Her mother laid on the couch bleeding.  'Why have you done this?' she asked bleeding to death.  'Larry loves me! We slept together every night, we even had sex in the laundry while you were showering this morning because he wants me not you!' she told her with so much hate and venom in her voice.' Now mother since you know everything say good bye.' she said stabbing her in the heart killing her instantly.  She took a shower, washed her clothes, throwing them in the drier before she left for school. When she came home police were all over the place, they stopped her from going inside, and she could hear Larry crying. That's good Larry play it up like you loved her. She thought to her self. 'Why can't I go inside it is my house?' she asked the officer.  They had Larry come out of the house to break the news to her that someone killed her mother; she became hysterical calling out for her mother! As Larry held her back tightly in his arms just where she wanted to be.  Larry was taken in for questioning but he had an alibi he was at work and the daughter was at school two murders with in a week and in the same neighborhood, both murders were by someone in a berserk state of mind, used different methods to kill the victims and there were no forced entry to either residence. Larry came home that night he was visibly shaken by the death of his wife. Nancy became upset when he told her they were going to go stay at his sisters for the night.  'Why when we can be alone here? We can not sleep in the same bed at your sisters.' She told him looking shocked that he didn't want to be alone with her.  'My wife is dead, murdered and you don't care? All you're thinking about is sleeping with me? Fuck that shit, I never should have even started this with you!' he told her.' stay here if you want too but I can't!' he yelled storming out of the room.  She was angry watching him leaving her alone. 'Fuck you! I will get even with you.' She said dialing the police where she reported that she feels he had something to do with it.  The officer came to the house where she cried when she saw the officer who was young, black hair, brown eyes and tall. He could not help being attracted to the young girl for her beauty was breath taking  'I think he had something to do with my mother's death, he has been sexually abusing me for awhile. My mom told him last night she was pregnant, he became enraged yelling at her he would take care of it him self. He raped me in the laundry room this morning while she was showering and tonight when I told him I couldn't not with it being in the house my poor mother was killed in, he said he'd be back to take care of me too.' She told them looking wide eyed and innocent.  'Your mother was pregnant?' the officer asked.  'Yes she told me this morning, she couldn't understand why I was so upset about it.' She told him crying.  'Why were you upset?' he asked her.  'Because! It meant we would never be rid of him!' she told him hysterically.  'Have you showered since the rape this morning?' he asked.  'Yes as soon as he left.' She said  'Well hopefully there may be something left its doubtful though.' he told her taking her to the hospital. On the way to the hospital he kept thinking of her in sexual positions with him becoming aroused.  At the hospital they did a scrapping and unfortunately for Larry there was enough semen to get. They sent it to run a DNA on it.  They released her and the young officer Dennis Shaunsey took her back to her house he asked his superior if he should stay just in case he returned tonight.  They sat in the family room she excused her self so she could get more comfortable changing into a long T shirt as she sat beside him on the couch she began to cry knowing he would take her in his arms. As he brushed her hair from her face he kissed her, she kissed him back, and his hand felt her breast, then in between her thighs feeling her wetness. They undressed where she sat on top of his lap as they sat up; she moved her hips and body in slow circular motions as he kissed her, caressing her breast as they both began to move faster reaching orgasm that left him speechless.  They picked Larry up he denied his wife was pregnant that he would have been told before Nancy, he said they had been sleeping together.  'she came into my room jumped on top of me, began kissing me, making me touch her breast, one thing led to another and we began fucking all the time. So I guess in reality she raped me!' he told them.  'Well your wife was pregnant, three months to be exact. Did you hire someone to kill her so you could keep knocking her daughter in the bed?' an older officer asked.  'I had nothing to do with my wife's death!' He yelled. 'That little bitch is setting me up! Can't you see that?' he asked.  'The night of your wife's murder didn't you leave the house angry threatening to take care of her too? Just because your step daughter refused having sex with you since she had just lost her mother? The officer asked him.  'No! It was her wanting us to sleep together that night!' he yelled realizing how Nancy framed him.  Nancy continued seeing Dennis, her father signed papers to be emancipated. She lived in the house that her father had paid off before her parents divorced. Larry convicted and put to death on two counts of murder and rape.  Theresa LoPresti her first year teaching in a high school was twenty four years old with an out look on life that there is good in everyone. She was slim built, shoulder length brown hair, greenish brown eyes; she was five feet six inches tall and engaged to be married on New Years Eve. Two gang members Anton Lincoln and Jeremiah Franklin were in her last period class when the other students left they lingered behind. Anton approached her as she stood with her back to them at the black board. Jeremiah locked the door. Anton grabbed Theresa holding her mouth with his hand as Jeremiah ran to them placing duck tape over her mouth.  'Do anything stupid and we will slit your throat!' Anton told her in a whisper in her ear.  Jeremiah ripped her clothes off of her staring at her nude body. 'oh yeah your going to ride me bitch!' he told her pushing her up against the wall kissing her as she cried as his hands roamed her body.  'Were you ever were with a black man before Miss LoPresti?' He asked her licking her breast.  Scared and felt like humiliated for not being able to protect her self shook her head no crying as he took his clothes off lying down on the floor. 'Get on and ride me.' He ordered her.  Anton holding her and forcing her on top of him watching him enter her. Jeremiah making her go real slow then he wanted it harder knocking her off of him then attacking her sexually on top of her. When Jeremiah was through with her Anton made her get on her knees performing oral on him. Two hours had gone by as they continued the sexual assault on her. She knew they were going to kill her; she had to do what ever it took to get out of there alive. She pretended she liked it even faking an orgasm. Four hours they continued this sexual assault on her body before leaving as she put her clothes on Anton turned to her.' Hey teach, you know it's against the law to have sex with a minor?' he asked her almost sounding like they were going to turn it around that she seduced them.  'Yeah we better get A's from now on, you hear me teach?' Jeremiah asked her in a threatening tone of voice.  Once they left she grabbed her cell phone calling the police. That night the boy's ages sixteen and seventeen were picked up and booked into the police station after Theresa identified them as her attackers.  She had to go through the hospital of having them probe her to get the evidence they needed. Her fiancÃ© told her to take the day off to get over it; the room would just be a reminder to her. She knew she would have to face it one day and today might as well be the day.  Theresa entered the room slowly as the rape scene began to replay in her mind over and over. One of her students distracted her memory by dropping a book causing her to jump.  'Sorry Miss. LoPresti.' He told her realizing he had scared her.  School had been in session for one hour when her school room door was busted opened by the two assailant's club members. Before anyone could move they shot Theresa in her forehead, killing and wounding most of the students in her class room, shooting as they ran down the hall ways firing at anyone who got into their paths.  They killed Theresa, three of her students, injured a total of seventeen people in the high school. The gang members feeling they had made their statement loud and clear to everyone that day that they would kill anyone who crossed them.  Theresa was laid to rest the same day that the gang members raped three of her female students with the warning they too would join their teacher if they opened their mouths to the authorities.  Timothy received the check from his mother's life insurance policy, the house became legally his that same day. He felt on top of the world, he committed the perfect murder and no one was even wise to him. That night as he sat in the family room watching television he heard a thud in the kitchen, he didn't pay any attention to it then he heard it again this time he went to the kitchen to see his mothers wheel chair hitting against the counter as if it was stuck. Timothy becoming fearful ran to his bedroom as he heard his mother calling for him, her voice was getting closer as he covered himself up completely crying under his covers.  'Tim is you in bed?' he heard his girlfriend ask.  'Oh hey Georgia, I didn't think you were going to make it tonight.' He said sitting up.  'Well we can get started on our lesson of love making.' She told him taking her red dress off as she walked towards the bed. She was a tall red head, her hair was long and wavy, and she was much endowed and very shapely.  She began to kiss him as she sat on top of him moving slowly as he caressed her breast. He closed his eyes feeling the passions growing with in him. He was almost ready to achieve an orgasm when he heard his mother's voice.  'Timmy, mother has something for you.' She said sounding very close by. He opened his eyes and began screaming as he was frozen with fear and could not move.  'Here's your fucking green beans!' she yelled as it was his mother sitting on top of him with her brains hanging out of her skull as she began bashing him in the head over and over again until he was dead.  They found him two days later in bed nude with the can of green beans in his hand. The police were dumb founded and in his parents will if anything happened to Tim their property and money was to be divided up between his aunt and the rest was to go to the less fortunate.  Nancy lay in her bed waiting for Dennis to come by during his lunch so they could make love. She heard his foot steps in the hall way she closed her eyes pretending to be a sleep, she felt her covers being pulled back , her breast being caressed then her night gown ripped off of her. She opened her eyes quickly seeing Larry with his skin decomposing; some of his flesh was falling off while he began raping her. 'Now I have raped you bitch! Go call the law and tell them now!' He told her grinning as he kissed her with the rotting flesh of his lips.  When he stepped away from the bed her mother began stabbing her repeatedly in the stomach. 'We are together for eternity and you're coming to join us!' she yelled plunging the knife in her then pulling it out and laying it in Nancy's hand. Dennis found her that night, the police could not figure out why two murders in one night?  That same night as the gang members were all hanging out in their club house Theresa and her three students came walking in as they each walked towards a gang member they would fire their gun killing each other as the bullets just went through Theresa and her students killing each other. They looked around the room and the gang members had successfully killed each other trying to kill the walking dead who had succeeded in avenging their deaths. Smiling they all vanished in a gold sparkling mist except for Theresa who showed up in the cell with Anton pulling back his covers she began performing oral sex on him, when he opened his eyes he began screaming trying to get away from her.  'Come here and finish our fuck session!' she demanded of him as her flesh was gray and smelt from rotting, her eyes dark with black rings around them, she opened her mouth as maggots fell out on to the floor.  He began screaming and crying begging her to stay away from him when the guards came opening the cell, he charged at them to get away from Theresa who was coming towards him smiling. They ordered him to stop or they would shoot, but he kept running until he dropped dead from their bullets. She smiled for she had one more cell to visit now dear Jeremiah.  He lay on his back dreaming he was having sex with a gorgeous blond, it began feeling so real as if she was really on top of him when he woke up seeing Theresa on top of him with the gaping bullet whole oozing out green puss as her skin was rotting and dropping off on to his chest. He screamed a blood curdling scream when his heart stopped beating from the fright he experienced seeing her. The mortician could not remove the frozen look of fear from his face.  Leanne appeared in the room where her foster father was raping another young foster child in her bed. Leanne taking a sharp butcher knife from the kitchen before coming into the room ran it as far up his rectum as possible. He began screaming from the pain the last thing he saw or heard before she plunged it in to him repeatedly was her smiling and saying to him.' Doesn't feel to good do it?' Once he was dead she looked at the frightened little girl crying on the bed. 'Run fast she is coming! They will say you did it! They never  Believe us when we do tell the truth. 'Leanne told the small child looking sadly at the girl she saved was only eight years old. She escaped through the window running to where ever she would be safe. The police found her wandering the streets where she told them how the bad man had hurt her, that when he went to the bathroom she was able to slip out the window of the bedroom. After being examined she was found to have been raped as she told them. They figured the wife killed him for letting her get away as it was her finger prints on the knife that she had used to cut up meat for dinner that night. the small girl told how they both would beat her and torture her with her soap in socks, and tying her hands together making her hang inches from the floor with a rope they had tied to a rod they had installed across the ceiling of her room hanging stuffed animals on it so the social workers wouldn't suspect them of anything.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© A Jury of twelve found her guilty of first degree Murder and guilty of child abuse as twenty other children came forward to the abuse they too had to endure while in the safe care of the two foster parents that the social workers checked out finding them up standing citizens, even though the husband had spent fifteen years in prison for robbery, drug possession charges.  Leanne smiled down from Heaven knowing that she been vindicated for the crimes they did to her in her short period of life on Earth.  The last month  The Dark Side leader the High Source sat in his luxurious dungeon, filled with the finest furnishings of gold torches lighting it by the flames they produced through out the dungeon that had a room for the rituals and sacrifices with beds, a gold altar with black candles all around it on the other side of the room a table where they feasted on flesh and drank blood, there was even a council room with conference tables and chairs where the highest of demons and the High source held their meetings for the plan of destroying innocent.  The High Source had his private room filled with a round bed, mirrors, chains, whips, all kinds of sexual toys that he used to torture some of the demons male or female he had sex with. His favorite the seductive fairy Orinda she was beautiful beyond belief with long black wavy hair past her full perfect rounded buttocks, ivory skin with eyes of velvet that glowed a florescent purple when she seduced the men or women casting her spell on them. After they had her sexually they would willingly walk away from their families to return to her. Once they willingly gave them selves to the Dark Side to be with her she would sink her teeth into their jugular vein killing them and sending them to join the Dark Sides army. The High Source captured her in the mountains for he lusted after her beauty. For mountain fairies are friendly and very beautiful taking in lost travelers who would stay for a week with them. The males how ever would return to the mountain fairies leaving their families. The High Source turned her into a blood sucking demon that could walk the earth day or night with other evil supernatural powers. She'd walk around the dungeon naked pleasuring demons that interested her. The High Source a huge demon with black scaly skin, his head was large with pointed ears, his eyes glowed red horns, long fingers with razor like nails. He would be sending her to see how much chaos she would be able to cause to the mortals before the white light warriors and the Dark Side warriors battled in the sky's as the mortals watched being slaughtered by the evil humans on earth. He lay in his bed waiting for her to come to him before she leaves. She enters walking slowly to him smiling.  'How may I pleasure you my master?' she asked as she slowly crawled up his large body kissing his body and caressing him, she laid on top of his hard scaly body kissing him as his hands caressed her body as she sat up riding the demon giving him the pleasures he desired and the lust she craved he full filled.  'When your job is done with mortals I have chosen you as my queen.' As he watched her achieving an orgasm then turning her on her back he began ravishing her body that would be completely his soon, with this knowledge that she would be his queen he had an explosive orgasm. He lay in his bed watching her leave to begin her destruction of human lives.  She appeared in front of a bar that most men visited after work before going home to their wives and children for their after work drink. She wore a tight long sleeved lavender dress that had a lavender broach built in with a diamond pendant in the center, the dress was cut low over her breast, her spiked heels matched perfectly to the dress. As she walked through the bar smiling which was filled with mostly men she over heard that tonight was his one year anniversary. Perfect she thought to her self sitting next to him at the bar. She looked at the man named Juan dressed in a blue business suit he was very well built like he worked out every day, he was tall, and he was Hispanic with blue eyes and black hair. As soon as Orinda sat next to him he was taken by her beauty and suddenly was not in a hurry to leave. What will one more drink hurt? He thought to him self looking at her smiling.  'May I buy you a drink?' he asked looking at her breast and body.  'Yes thank you.' She told him smiling touching his hand that sent desire for her through him.  'Would you like to move to table over in the corner?' he asked forgetting his wife and anniversary.  'Great let's move to the one in the corner.' She said pointing to the one in the dark and offs by it self.  They sat there for an hour talking and laughing he had placed his arm around her chair and every once in a while would stroke the back of her hair. He leaned over kissing her softly on the lips.  'I want you.' He told her kissing more as his hand caressed her breast where no one could see what he was actually doing.  'Let's go then.' She told him smiling.  They left the bar checking into a hotel room, he was even more under her spell when they stood naked in front of each other. He took her in his arms as he touches her body all over. He picked her up in his arms carrying her to the bed where he made passionate love to her that he never even made to his wife. Her eyes glowed as her spell was being fully cast upon him. He was totally oblivious to her eyes that glowed Florissant purple as he stared deep into them. They made love all night in the room. The next morning when they woke up in each others arms he knew he would have to leave her and it pained him to have to separate from her.  'I will rent the room for a week if you'll stay here.' He told her kissing her.  She looked at him smiling kissing him.' I will stay only if you're coming back here.' She told him as she fondled him smiling.' one for the road big guy?' she asked laughing as he began kissing her.  Juan's wife Sherry was up all night, she searched the streets in her car unable to find him. She could not believe he was not hurt or worse to stay gone all night when last night was their one year anniversary. Sherry was blond with long hair, blue eyes, she could have been a fashion model with her looks and body. The police told her he had to be missing for twenty four hours before they could do anything. She cried sitting in her living on the love seat they shared every night holding their wedding picture crying. Juan came walking in the door, he looked at her and with out saying a word went to his bedroom where he began packing.  'Where have you been?' sherry asked following him into the room shocked to see him packing. 'Where are you going?' she asked sniffling.  Juan did not answer her or even look at her until she grabbed him.' where the fuck are you going? You've been with another woman I can smell the slut all over you!' she yelled at him breaking their wedding picture.  Juan slapped her across the face knocking her to the floor.' She is not a slut!' he told her as he headed towards the door.' Have a great life Sherry, I won't be coming back. 'he told walking out of the bedroom and her life  'Fuck you! you son of a bitch!' she yelled still on the floor crying hysterical as her marriage just crumbled around her with out an explanation of this other woman just, have a great life.' Like hell you'll just walk out on me!' she said angered by being tossed away like yesterdays left over as she got to her feet running out of the house she could still see his car.  Sherry hurriedly got into her car squealing the tires as she backed out of the drive way. 'oh your bitch is going to have to fight for you if she wants you Mr. Juan!' she said looking in her rear view mirror seeing his hand print beginning to swell.' Bastard! Hit me will you?' she said following far enough behind where he could not see her.  She parked far enough so she could follow him into the hotel with out him seeing her. She watched the floor he took the elevator to. She walked up to the desk clerk a short elderly man that was slightly plump, wearing wire framed glasses, clean shaven and reminded her of a butler.' that man who just got on the elevator is Juan Garcia, my husband and as you can see by my face he has assaulted me.' She said breaking down into tears trying to finish her sentence placing her hand over her mouth as this seemed like a night mare to her.' please call the police I wish to press charges against him.' She told him looking at him through her tear filled eyes as her cheek was swelling and beginning to discolor.  'Are you alright other then your face?' asked the desk clerk who was concerned for her safety she reminded him of his daughter.' my name is Maurice, please come into my office where you will be safe in case they should come down.  So she is up there too. Sherry thought to her self.' Thank you.' she told him trying to smile. Fuck him in jail bitch. She thought following Maurice to his office where she waited for the police to arrive drinking the hot coffee Maurice had brought to her.  Juan and Orinda lay on the bed kissing when she looked at him rising up on one arm lying on her side.' Would you like to be with me forever?' She asked looking seriously.  'Yes Orinda you are who I want to be with forever.' He told her smiling touching her face softly.  'Would you be willing to join me in the Dark Side as a warrior to fight against our enemies?' she asked him running her finger along his shirt covering his chest.  He smiled taking her in his arms.' Baby I would go anywhere you wanted and be anything you wanted me to be, I would fight all of your enemies to protect you from harm that ever came your way.' He told her holding the side of her face kissing her.  Smiling she raised up adjusting herself to sit on top of him as he thought she was the most gorgeous woman in the lavender negligee smiling down at him as her eyes began to glow leaning down towards him as she opened her mouth to sink her fangs into his neck.  There was a loud banging on the door startling them both they looked at the door. Juan got up off the bed walking to the door when he opened it he saw Sherry with two very large police officers.  'Is this your husband who hit you?' The younger officer asked Sherry.  'Yes that's him!' she told him crying as she became upset seeing Orinda standing behind her husband.  'Your wife said you struck her in her face knocking her to the ground, is this true?' The officer asked while his partner watched the couple in the room.  'Yes I hit her! She called Orinda a slut! She is not one to be judging who is a slut.' He told them feeling justifiable in his actions as he shot daggers at his wife.  'Well you're married to Sherry Garcia, leaving her the day after your one year anniversary after spending the night with this one so I doubt that Mrs. Garcia is the slut sir. Turn around and place your hands behind your back your under arrest for assault and battery.' The older shorter officer told Juan.  'You bitch!' he yelled as the police grabbed him.  'I am very sorry officers, but I can't allow you to take him.' Orinda told them stepping to the side of Juan.  'Really? You can't allow us?' the younger one asked almost laughing.  'That's right and now you three will be leaving.' She said looking at the younger officer evilly as a flame appeared in her hand.  'What the hell?' the older officer asked as Sherry began backing up and running down the corridor.  she ran she hearing their screams as Orinda set them a blaze as she looked back terrified before she could even think the word help Orinda blasted her with a torch racing flame which broke her spell on Juan as he cried out Sherry's name when Orinda pushed him back into the room knocking him so hard he flew on the bed where she leaped on top of him in a matter of seconds .  'Your mine!' she hissed at him then sucked his blood from his body. She smiled at his lifeless body.' Welcome soldier 'she told him kissing his lips smiling then sent him on his way to the Dark side.  Maurice came to see what the disturbance was when he saw the charred remains of the police officers and Sherry Garcia as other guest stuck their heads out with horrified expressions.  'Call for help, sweet Jesus Satan is loose.' he said making the crucifix across his chest with his hand walking towards the open door when Orinda and Juan were staying in to find it empty as if no one had been inside at all.  Orinda dressed in a black shiny half shirt with matching slacks that fit very low on her hips and were wide at the leg's with a pair of black shiny opened toe heels, her hair pulled up into a tight pony tail, her make up almost made her look oriental with just the foundation and thick lined black eye liner. She sat next to a tall, thin African American man dressed very nicely in a yellow pull over dress shirt, white pants and white shoes. He must have been in his fifty's. he looked over at her looking at her body wishing women looked like that when he was younger smiling at her he thought to him self what the hell I will give it a shot to see if she likes older men. What his wife didn't know wouldn't hurt her  'Hello my name is Fred and could I buy a gorgeous lady like your self a drink?' he asked leaning more towards her looking into those beautiful eyes that seemed to make him desire her more.  'Yes please a screw driver.' She told him.  'If you have the screw I have the driver.' He told her smiling it was his oldest pick up line.  'I might want to borrow it tonight.' She told him smiling running her hand up his leg to the inner thigh and feeling his crotch. 'oh and such a nice size one too.' She told him smiling as he leaned over kissing her as his buddies watched in surprise that he was going to have her tonight.  What a lucky bastard Clifton a heavy man in Fred's age group thought to him self watching his friend getting more and more into kissing the gorgeous young woman. Five minutes he'll be leaving with her. He thought to him self smiling. And they did just as he predicted going to a hotel.  She undressed him kissing his body removing his clothing then getting on her knees to pleasure him orally. He was beginning to feel him self getting weak in the knees as the orgasm exploded like a volcano for this was the first time he experienced oral sex. He then undressed her caressing her breast, kissing her body laying her on the bed where he pleasured her with oral sex loving how her body moved as he tasted her sweet juices, how she massaged her breast then gripping the side of the bed when she exploded moaning such erotic pleasures as she had an orgasm. Surprised he was aroused again he lay on his back as she rode him slowly sitting straight up massaging her hardened nipples when he could not take it any longer throwing her on her back and entering her feeling more passion flow through his body then he ever felt with any other woman before. When he finally looked at the clock it was eight in the morning and he did not care that his wife was furious.  Thelma paced the floor as her and Fred's four boys ranging in ages of five years old to eighteen years old running through there small three bedroom white wooden house. By noon, her and her eighteen year old and sixteen year old son's became worried about Fred. Curtis,  Thelma's eighteen year old son went to his friends house's no one had seen him until he got to Clifton's house who had just read in the news paper of the two police officers and Sherry being torched to death so severely there were hardly any remains left of their bodies, the police were still looking for Juan Garcia and the mysterious woman he was with at the motel. Clifton told him the woman matched the description of the woman the police are looking for.  Curtis began calling the entire hotel from Clifton until he found the hotel he was at. Both men went there telling the desk clerk it was his fathers birthday and he was there to surprise him since he just flew in from Texas. The clerk figuring there wouldn't be any harm sent them up to their room. The men could hear the moans coming from inside the room. Fred had given her his word to join her in the Dark Side battle. Curtis banged on the door so loud the whole place went silent. Fred opened the door finding his son and friend standing there.  'What the hell do you two want?' he asked with just the sheet wrapped around him as Orinda lay in the bed naked.  'You need to come home now pop's.' Curtis told his father feeling betrayed by him.  'I am never going back son, tell your mama good bye for me.' He said trying to shut the door.  'Fuck you old man you tell her self. You were man enough to fuck a whore all night be man enough to break it off with your wife of twenty nine years your self!' he yelled as his father punched him.  Orinda had become aggregated with the whole situation. 'Hurry Fred we are not done.' She told him for she had just been ready to take his life when they were interrupted.  'No, but we are through Father!' Curtis told him as tears formed in his big brown eyes.  'Bastard!' Fred yelled as the two men walked away.  Orinda stood by the window watching for the two men as Fred stood behind her caressing and kissing her neck when she spotted them casting two huge lightening bolts down killing them both then turned to Fred with her eyes glowing sinking her teeth into his flesh. Then they both vanished. The official ruling for the cause of the two men being struck by lightening was due to a freak of nature since it was a sunny day with not a cloud in the sky.  Orinda showed up that night at another bar in an oriental opal colored satin dress with her hair up in a bun and wearing opal tear dropped earrings with matching shoes and hand bag. She spotted a very handsome man, he must have been in his forties and his body was so built. Well I will not mind seducing this one. She thought smiling to her self sitting next to him. He did not even look at her at all just looking straight a head drinking his bourbon on the rocks.  Orinda decided she would make the move on him.' Hello I am...' he stopped her before she could even say another word.  'Orinda and now we are leaving.' he told her grabbing her by the arm.  She was stunned as he led her out of the bar.' I am Knight Shadow well you may think now I am your night mare instead.' He told her smiling.  She looked at him realizing who he was.' The High Priest of the White Light warriors.' She said slowly, then looking almost relieved.' Please do vanquish me and put me out of my misery of this evil creature The High Source turned me into. I am a mountain Fairy I do not want to hurt people to make them join his forces.' She told him crying finally relieved to be released from him. 'God take mercy on the souls I have stolen through deceit and myself if you can forgive me Father.' She said looking up at the sky crying meaning every word she said.  Knight Shadow looked at her. 'Our Higher Power does not punish those who are good Orinda, even if they did acts of evil due to spells. So it is my wish that Orinda be released from this demons hell and let the Higher Power cleanse her soul as she wished.' He said as she vanquished from the street where they stood as everything stopped in time. It is said that a spirit of a mountain fairy can be heard and seen dancing and laughing through the mountains as she casts off a gold glittering aura.  As time grew closer for the battle of evil verse's good the world was becoming unstable not with just crimes but with mother nature her self as the Dark Side would send tremendous storms without warning. So many peoples lives were taken during these storms, the weather forecasters could not explain them. Natannie Bear sat in her apartment she shared with her boyfriend Ron Deutch and her sister Shadaisha Bear. She began to have a premonition of evil approaching. Natannie and her sister Shadaisha were identical twins, they had long black hair, brown eyes, they were average height and they both had athletic bodies. They both wore a charm given to them by their mother to keep the Raven mocker away. The charms were filled with a strong medicine made by a medicine man, who would sit at the doors of sick people to keep the Raven Mocker out of the home. The Raven Mocker would go in to the house invisible scaring the poor sick person so bad that they died. The Raven Mocker ate their hearts to add to his years by stealing their remaining years and it rejuvenated him. There is not any trace of where he removed the heart. A Raven Mocker is old and withered looking, they can also be female; they soar from the skies to where ill victims laying in bed with the cry of the Raven as it is diving only so much more intense that the ones who can hear The Raven Mocker their hearts and bodies are filled with fear. The only way to kill them is with a strong medicine once the Raven Mocker sees the person with the medicine he tries to flee from them for once they are recognized in their true form they die in seven days. Natannie and Shadaisha mother had the charms made when three Raven Mockers came and stole their fathers remaining years when he became very ill from a rare blood infection. The Raven Mockers came in a group of three where they actually would pick him up tossing him on the floor, his wife thinking he was having some kind of an attack since she could not see the Raven Mockers a husband, wife and her brother. A medicine man heard of the ill man hearing the cry of the Raven Mocker then knew where to find it. Unfortunately the medicine man got to the house to late. They had tormented the man so much he let go of the life with in him. When the medicine man saw the Raven Mocker's standing in front of the house they lived in next door of the man they killed the medicine man looked at them and they knew their days were numbered. Seven days later their bodies were found dead in their living room as each lay on the floor as if they were preparing to leave the house when they suddenly dropped dead.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© Natannie sat in her over stuffed black leather chair when she had another vision of thousands of Raven Mocker's flying down from the sky and preying on the sick in hospitals, in their homes, she could hear their raven cries it was becoming deafening to her ears where she sat in the chair dressed in her boyfriends boxer shorts and one of his FBI T shirts. She had her feet up in the chair holding her ears when Shadaisha came in seeing her sister looking as if she was in sever pain as tears rolled down her face. 'Natannie what is wrong with you?' she asked rushing to her sister touching her leg she felt and heard her sister's vision it caused her to drop to her knees.  'What is happening? Why are you seeing these evil creatures?' she asked Natannie for now she was frightened for her sister's visions always came true.  Finally the vision ceased she felt relief from the pain.' Evil is going to cast a horrible disease that can't be cured and people will get it so the evil can release all the Raven Mocker's down to steal their years from them causing their deaths.' Natannie told her sister crying as she spoke.' The disease is so highly contagious you just pass a person and you are infected with it.' Natannie told Shadaisha as they both cried for fear of the Raven Mocker's taking their years as they did their beloved father.  When their mother became ill the sisters and the medicine man sat around her bed preventing the Raven Mockers from entering the house as the girls wore their charms and the medicine man had his in his medicine pouch. The medicine man had long silver hair; he wore a wide brim hat, a white long sleeve shirt, with a multi colored vest, black jeans and moccasin boots. When he tracks a Raven Mocker and they die, he sits with the body until it is buried in the ground. It is there that the evil witches unearths the Raven Mocker and abuses his corpse for in the Raven Mocker's life even the witches feared them.  Ron came home from work finding the two women upset, hearing the story he found it hard to believe. Raven Mockers, it is just an old folk lore of the Cherokees. He thought to him self. Natannie told him more of her vision of the horrible disease that would kill hundreds of people and there was not a cure for it. Ron was tall and medium built, his hair was dark brown as were his eyes. He was an F.B.I. agent and found her hard to believe.  'Ok. Your telling me that thousands of these Raven Mockers will be attacking sick people from this disease that these evil ones are sending to us and then the Raven Mockers will steal what years of life the victim had left?' he asked her looking at her strangely.  'Yes that is exactly what I am telling you! The end of time is coming very soon.' Natannie told him looking very scared.  'So what can we do Natannie? Send some F.B.I. agent's into hell to stop the bad guys?' He asked her in a patronizing tone of voice.  Natannie looked at him seriously.' No Ron because there will not be an agency much alone agents. 'She told him looking at Shadaisha who believed in her sister's visions and knew she was telling the truth that the Great War was going to begin as told to them by the Chief of their tribe.  Natannie rose from her chair looking very sad into her sister's eyes. She knew they must start preparing for the Great War that their mother told them this was to be their destiny. In their bed rooms they prayed to the protector who at one time had been an injured wolf found by seven young girls who were trying to find their tribe before the approaching danger could find them. The seven girls forgetting of the danger tracking them nursed the wolf back to health who became their protector. When the danger found the girls, the wolf gave the eerie sounding howl of the wolf. Soon the wolf's pack had circled the girls keeping the danger from getting to them, which was the serpent, who could transform into human shape. The wolves defeated the evil creature before the tribe found the girls. Fearing for the safety of their daughters, they killed every one of the wolves. When the daughters told them of the horrible mistake they made they vowed to honor the wolf and their spirits became the protector of women.  Over their window was a Mandela to help bring good luck to the house, over there beds were dream catchers to catch the evil dreams into its webbing and allows the good ones to enter. There were spirit chimes and medicine wheels. Natannie and Shadaisha practiced their spiritual beliefs everyday.  Ron came into the room finding Natannie crying, seeing her cry tore his heart out. He walked to the bed where she sat taking her in his arms as he sat next to her.' I am sorry I hurt your feelings Natannie.' He told her kissing her forehead.  'It's not you Ron, but soon it will come to pass and you'll know I was telling the truth.' She told him holding on to him tightly.  As Natannie and Shadaisha slept, their parents came to them in their dreams. 'You our precious daughter's have been chosen to be great warriors. You will suffer sadness but it brings a visitor who will explain what you must do.' Their parents kissed both of their daughter's and then a beautiful female warrior took them back. dressed in a white suede halter top that tied around her neck and around her waist, with fringe dangling from the bottom edge of the top a short warrior's skirt that had the side opened at the waist, her head dress was all white with long feathers going down her back, white boot moccasins. Her hair was long and black she smiled at them as she departed with their parents.  That morning in the kitchen over breakfast, they told each other their dreams realizing they did come to them. 'Wonder who the visitor will be?' Shadaisha asked.  Natannie sipped her coffee, as Ron was dressed and ready to leave for work Natannie whispered. 'I don't know, but they will explain to us what is going on.' She did not want him to hear them as he came into the kitchen.  'I will see you ladies tonight.' He said smiling kissing Natannie good-bye.  Natannie sat in the living room at her computer writing a book on her heritage and belief, suddenly she had a vision of an old Indian man with long white hair, a band around his head, dressed in clothes made from buckskin. He was sitting in the dark with the fire as it cast mystical looking sparks into the air rising to the sky. He was chanting in the Cherokee native tongue. She wondered what it meant. She wrote down the words as she watched the vision as if it was on a screen in front of her. A beautiful white wolf appeared beside him, the wolf gave a howl into the night and then it looked as if it looked right into her eyes as the Indian man kept chanting never stopping. The vision disappeared as the wolf disappeared into the darkness.  Natannie went online to get the chant translated. She was confused as to what it said.  The great white wolf is your sister and you two shall become one before long. Natannie was very confused by all of this. What does it mean? She thought to her self.  Natannie's heart sank when she read that an unknown disease had already killed forty people in Europe and several cases had been located in the United States. There was not any kind of treatment for it. 'It is here.' She said a loud to herself.  The phone began to ring it was Ron he had heard the news and apologized for doubting her visions. He knew there was not anyway she could have known before today. Natannie hung the phone up.  'That is why I heard your death calls; you were stealing those innocent people's years.' She said looking out the window at the sky.  Natannie quickly dressed in a pair of faded blue jeans, with wide legged bottoms, a black pull over sleeveless half top, a suede belt with her native design and colors, long fringe hanging at the each end of it. Her brown suede moccasins, she put on her medicine wheel earrings and grabbed Shadaisha's earrings to take to her job where she was tending bar at the local pub down the street.  When she asked for Shadaisha they told her Shadaisha was rushed to the hospital, she became very ill and past out. Natannie knew what it was. 'No! You won't take her.' She said going out of the pub the owner looking at her strangely shaking his head.  As she ran down the street, she heard the Raven Mockers cries then the wolf howl as if to chase the Raven Mocker away. Natannie ran all the way there to find her sister in intensive care. They allowed her to sit with her. Natannie held her hand as Shadaisha fought for life. She could feel the Raven Mocker waiting at the door but the medicine in the charms was holding the evil creature off.  Natannie called Ron telling what had happened that he needed to get to the hospital quickly. He had permission for the helicopter to deliver him there so he could be by Natannie and her sister. As he past every old person, he would call them a Raven Mocker, he believed in her visions now. He was devastated by how fast the disease was taking her life. Two nurses came in to give her medicine to ease her pain and asked them to step outside while they changed her gown. Natannie looked back to see one nurse trying to take off the charm.  'No do not remove it! You will let the Raven Mocker in! She'll die!' She told them getting upset.  'Ok we will leave it on her.' They told her.  As they sat in the waiting room, the hospital called a code blue, doctors, and nurses went running to Shadaisha's room. Natannie began running from the waiting room down the hall where the two nurses stood looking at her very pale looking.  'you removed it didn't you?' she asked them angrily when she saw an old woman quickly walking down the hall.' Raven Mocker! You now have seven days of life!' Natannie yelled at the old woman who turned with the look of knowledge to what she just yelled at her.  'My sister is dead! Because of you!' she yelled as tears ran down her face.  'It was the disease.' One nurse told her.  'Check her chest cavity her heart will be gone because they are feeding on the people's hearts stealing their years.' She told them crying. 'I mean it! I want a fucking autopsy done do you understand?' she cried out at the hospital staff.  Ron waiting with Natannie while they did a special rush autopsy on Shadaisha. The doctor could not believe that she was telling the truth, Shadaisha's heart was gone.  'In all my years as a doctor I have never encounter such a case, there was not one trace of evidence that the heart had been removed.' He told Natannie and Ron. He reminded Ron of Quincy the television show, in looks and actions.  There was an order placed for all the patients who had died to have their chest cavities check where the same thing happened their hearts were gone. Natannie gained the ability to detect a Raven Mocker calling them by Raven Mocker with only seven days to live. She wore both charms of the medicine, and mourned her sister deeply.  A month had gone by since Shadaisha's death; Ron had already left for work. Natannie stood by the fireplace looking at Shadaisha's picture, she heard Shadaisha's door opening. Natannie turned to see who was coming out of it when she saw the white wolf coming into the living room. Natannie stood still not fearing the wolf at all. The wolf sat down in front of her. Natannie looked at her smiling.  'Welcome home my sister.' She told the wolf that had beautiful blue eyes.  The wolf transformed into Shadaisha spirit. She was dressed in a beautiful white out fit; it resembled the fur of the wolf. The top was a vest, and the bottom was the warrior's loincloth, with a flap of white soft material in the front and back. the head dress was all white except around the band was designed with turquoise and silver beads, she wore a silver and blue choker around her neck and both of her wrist, a silver slave bracelet around her upper arm, her moccasin boots matched her out fit.  'Natannie the time has come for us to be joined as one.' Shadaisha told her as she walked towards her and then her spirit entered Natannie's body.  Natannie felt a surge of energy and knew she now had special powers. Someone knocked on her door; she walked towards the door knowing it was the one who would explain to her what was going to happen to them in the fight against evil. She opened the door to find a beautiful woman with long dark brown hair.  'Natannie Shadaisha I have been waiting to meet you.' Mystical Shadow told her.  'You called me Natannie Shadaisha why?' she asked the mysterious woman.  'You carry your sister's warrior soul don't you?' She asked her smiling.  'You're a witch.' She told her suddenly knowing who she was. 'The High Priestess of the white light.' She whispered.  'Yes, we're not too much different in our beliefs of spirits, magic, charms, potions, visions of things to come.' She told Natannie.  Natannie thought and she was right, 'ok you got me on that one we do have similar beliefs.' She told her.  The two women sat down and began to talk about the up coming war in one week. As they were discussing things, Natannie had a vision of Ron attacked by a huge Demon in an alley. She suddenly transformed into the wolf running through the closed door.  'I am right behind you girl.' Mystical shadow told her as she vanished.  Mystical shadow appeared in the alley as the wolf was crouched and growling at the demon known as Apparatus. He was seven feet tall, weighed four hundred pounds and looked like a horned demon with red glowing eyes, and claws for fingers. He looked at Mystical shadow who was smiling at him as he held Ron up in the air by his neck.  'Put him down now.' Mystical shadow told him.  Natannie appeared now as Shadaisha throwing a flaming arrow into his chest causing him to drop Ron on the ground. Through her powers she now had she floated Ron behind her and Mystical shadow.  Ron could not believe what he was seeing when he heard Mystical shadow began to chant her spell. 'I mystical Shadow the High Priestess of the White light order this foul smelling creature to be added to a new feature and that is in the lake of hell for eternity he'll spend his term in his fiery jail.' She said as she blew him up.  Ron looked and saw his body laying where the demon had dropped him, but how could I be here, and laying there? He asked himself when the realization hit him, he was dead, and 'I am dead!' he shouted in a panicked voice.  Mystic Shadow looked at Ron. 'Calm down and step back into your body, I will heal you.' She told him. 'Hurry I have three minutes left to bring you back.' She told him as he stepped back into his lifeless body. Mystic shadow laid her hands on him as a bright light glowed around them for a few minutes and he was alive again.  Before the three of them left, the area Mystic shadow left two dead clones of Ron and Natannie. She saw who was behind this; it was the director of the FBI. He knew of Natannie and Shadaisha becoming one powerful warrior, knowing that she would see the vision and rush to help Ron, the one thing he did not count on was Mystic shadow being there. Mystic shadow took them back with her to protect them from the Dark Side.  Natannie changed into a white dress with a light blue trim in the shape of a V from her neck to her cleavage, the fringe trimmed the out lining of the V, a single feather in her long black hair on the left side, the sleeves were wide like wings with white fringe hanging from the bottom of the arms and the bottom of the hem of the dress, that was just below her knees. Her white moccasins boots were below her knees trimmed in fringed, and lace up the front in white suede. She looked beautiful.  Mystic Shadow watched as the warriors trained Ron for combat and Natannie laughing when he tripped trying to avoid the fireballs shot at him. Mystical Shadow slipped away with out being missed as she popped into the director's office as his mistress Alison.  'I have been waiting for you, what took you so long to show up?' he asked feeling irritated because his wife could show up any minute.  Mystic shadow smiled as she thought of the woman being tied up by magical rope.' I am sorry I got tied up in traffic.' She told him as she flung her blond hair back wearing a red top and a tight white skirt showing the out line of her red thong as she walked over to him unbuttoning her shirt sitting down on his lap. As he, UN snapped the front of her bra caressing her breast.  'These were definitely worth the investment to enlarge them.' he them began kissing and licking her nipples. He was bald; he was over weight with big bulging eyes. 'I have to have you now.' He told her ripping her panties off and entering her as he laid her on his desk. It was only a few minutes and he reached a climax. 'Well here is one hundred dollars and tonight you have to be with the assistant director when they come for him. Before the week is over we will have replaced all the mortal leaders before the war even starts.' He laughed as he kissed her good bye.  Mystic shadow returned to her own body as she popped into the woman's apartment. She went to the closet, placing her hands on the woman's temples extracting the demon from her body. The woman was dead that the demon had replaced.  'Say good bye chucky baby.' She told the green skinned demon, with purple glowing eyes, long claws and webbed feet, its hair brown and stringy with ears that looked like bat wings. Mystic Shadow vanquished the demon before it could even think.  Mystic Shadow went to the home of assistant director where she explained to him what was happening, she took him back with her replacing a clone of him to be killed. The warriors were sent through out the world to rid the powerful offices of the demons and replacing them with clones.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the office of the director unbuttoning her top as always when she stopped. 'I want to give you a blow job.' She told him licking her lips slowly as soon as he had removed his penis from his pants she blew him up. 'Oops! I got confused I meant I wanted to blow you up.' She told the ashes that were left behind. On her way out she left behind the clone of the dead director.  Mystic Shadow appeared in the office of the President of the united state, he was the first African American to be elected to office just three months ago and a week later the Dark Sides leader had taken over his body. She appeared as the director's mistress. She was dressed in a black leather jacket, short skirt and black boots.  'The director sent me here to make sure you had everything you needed.' She told him smiling.  'Come here and let me see you up closer.' He said smiling as he walked around his desk.  She walked up to him when suddenly he grabbed her kissing her as his tongue ran into her mouth. She realized he had tied her in chains.  'Mystic Shadow , how nice of you to come to see me, pleasure me you will since your husband took my Queen away from me.' He said smiling touching her breast. 'Now I will take his in every way before killing you.' He held her tighter against his body when they were in his dungeon in his room. He laughed as he transformed into his hideous grotesque self.  He had somehow frozen her powers her heart began beating fast. He ripped her clothes off as well as the chains throwing her on his bed; she began to scream as he tried to enter her body to rape her. Mystic Shadow was powerless and helpless.  Suddenly she recognized a voice yelling for the demon master to release her. Flame Caster had heard her screams before the demon master could reach Flame Caster he blew him up in one huge fireball and quickly wrapped a blanket around Mystic Shadow as they vanished from the dungeon. Once back home her powers slowly returned to her as she and the other seven witches made potions, spells, training harder then they ever trained for any battle. They knew some were not coming back, that they would be going home.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 26 by Erotica_Writings Â© The night before the battle was to take place they threw a surprise birthday party for the twins. The eight original witches dressed in their traditional sexy gowns of the same design just different colors.  Mystic Shadow wore a white opal gown that would change different shades as the light hit it just right. Mystic Caster wore a black sequined gown, Mystical Lightening wore a half black and half white opal dress in honor of her mother and grand mother, Natannie wore a long white gown made of suede, with thin straps across the shoulder and criss crossed in the back. Fringe was embroider across the top of her breast, with white suede hills with fringe across the toes, a single feather in her hair.. The men were all in black tuxedos.  Knight Shadow and Mystical Shadow danced as they did when they first met. She would rub her body very seductively, up against his then grinding down to the floor and he'd pull her up slowly, close to his body with his face inches away from her lips. As the party was going into the night Knight Shadow and Mystic shadow appeared at the lighthouse where they spent many hours there before. As they sat on the bench, she straddled his lap facing him as they made love to each other as they did years ago with her kissing him hungrily. He kissed her neck softly, as she moved her hips slowly; he ran his hands over her dress feeling how she still reacted to his touch with a slight moan from deep with in her. He was her love and only love. He felt her passions getting more intense as she ran her hands over her breast, down her stomach with her eyes closed, her lips partly opened moaning , it drove him wild with desire as they both experienced the most intensified orgasm ever.  They returned to the party everyone was eating and drinking, Knight Shadow and Mystic Shadow gave Flame Caster and Mystical lightening each a pendant with a note attached that after tomorrow it will all be explained to them the importance of the pendants. Mystical Caster turned to Lightening Caster as he held her tightly for they both knew what the pendants meant. Mystical Caster cried into her husband's chest.  That night after the party was over each of the original witches, warlocks all relived moments in their lives that meant the most to them. Mystical Shadow smiled 'my fondest memories were all of Knight Shadow and our love we shared for each other.' He took her hand kissing it.  'I will love you my sweetest dream beyond eternity.' He said, as his eyes got a little misty.  They all went to bed to sleep before the last battle they were to fight ever again. That morning they all were in their warrior outfits, Natannie came into the room her face half white wolf and half woman she wore the outfit she wore the day they battled the demon who killed Ron, and Mystical Shadow had brought back to her.. Ron followed behind her dressed in the warrior's uniform of the White Light.  They divided into different sections each group would go into a different part of the world to battle the Dark Side. Mystical Shadow and Knight Shadow with their original ten warriors, Rain Caster, Enchantress Caster, Dream Caster, Destiny Shadow, Crystal Caster, Jada Caster, Coral Shadow, Mystical of Light. Were ready to go fight for the good and freedom from hell for the mortal's they had been protecting for years.  Natannie was surrounded by wolves, and Indian warrior's from different tribes along with their Chiefs, and medicine men that carried pouches full of their medicines to kill the evil they had to battle. The Furies were there to battle the evil mortals on earth.  Mystical Lightening, Flame Caster, their Parents Mystical Caster, Lightening Caster, Guardian Caster, Shadow Caster were all waiting to depart. Fire Caster arrived with the spiritual Warriors and now they would all depart in their directions to battle all over the world.  As all the warriors appeared in the skies the mortals looked in horror as they watched demons, and foul creatures appear in the sky as both sides faced each other in a line . The battle began when they heard the scream of the Banshee guided by the Miracle Child streaking through the skies over the earth. The demons and the warrior's threw lightening bolts, firebombs and potions, while the evil mortals were slewing the innocence in the streets, their homes and churches. The twins traveled from country to country destroying every evil demon, creature and evil mortal they came across, while Natannie and the tribal warriors killed thousands of the Dark side with their flaming bows and arrows soaked in the medicine men's potions. Mystical Shadow began to spin as if a massive tornado spraying the potion on the Dark Side Warrior's. Gore warrior's demon spirit looked at her with a smile. 'Your time is up here.' he said laughing and hit her with a huge lightening ball injuring her fatally. Falling to the ground she knew she was dying. A pack of wolves slowly surrounded her keeping evil away from her. Knight Shadow flew down to where she lay, taking her into his arms and holding her tightly. 'Cheyenne.' he said as tears filled his eyes. He knew that her life drained from her body. He softly ran his hand through her hair.  She looked up into his eyes with so much love and admiration. 'I love you my sweet husband, don't mourn my death, but celebrate my new adventures in another world. 'She told him as blood began to run from her mouth.  The wolves stood in a circle around them just as a lightening bolt struck Knight Shadow;  ' Thank you.' he said as he lay down beside Mystical Shadow holding her tightly as they life's were slipping away in each others arms. The wolves stood stead fast as red beams shot from their eyes killing the demons and anything else that was evil coming near the fallen High Priest and High Priestess.  'I told you that you couldn't get rid of me that easy.' He told her kissing her.  She smiled weakly looking into his eyes. 'Even in death we will be together, I wouldn't want to leave this world without you.' She told him laying her head down on his shoulder. Tears rolled slowly down her face.  The other warriors saw the angel of death coming to collect Mystical Shadow and Knight Warrior, Mystic Caster saw her parents laying there on the side walk, she began screaming hysterically and blowing demons and evil that crossed her path into oblivion. She flew down to them crying. 'Oh no, please don't leave me now.' She cried as the wolves allowed her into the circle. 'Mom, dad, I love you both with all of my heart.' She said kissing them both good- bye. She cried kneeling next to the angel of death who wore a golden suit that matched his golden hair. A golden brilliant glow emulating him.  'It won't belong before I have to take them, you better call the others so they can say fare well to them. 'He told her in a soft-spoken voice.  Mystic caster looked so lost. ' No please don't take them.' she pleaded to him.  'You need to call for the others.' The Angel of death told her without any emotions.  When everyone gathered around them Natannie prayed a native prayer for them' For Tache Ushte and Tache Che ^^ Techihhila' she told them kissing them good-bye.  'What did you tell them?' Mystic Caster asked her.  'May the great spirit watch over you always.' She told her as tears fell down her face watching her new friend let go of life. She felt like a sister to her in the short time span they had together.  Mystical Lightening and Flame caster arrived seeing their grand parents mortally wounded, they were so shaken up by it. Mystical Lightening tried to heal them with her tears.  The angel of death stopped her by grabbing her arm. 'It is their time to go home now, your tears only heal those who the Higher Power has not called home to him.' He told her seeing how devastated she was, she looked shocked realizing her special gift could not heal them.  Flame Caster took his grand mothers and grand fathers hands. Mystical Shadow told him.  ' Never let the pendants leave you, finish our work here, do not allow our deaths to be in vain.' She told him as a tear ran down her face.  'Grand mother.' He said just as the other ten warriors were killed by the demons.  'Everyone is here now; it's time to go home.' The angel of death told them as he rose from his kneeling position.  They watched their glittering soul's race to heaven with the Angel of death. The wolves howled their eerie sounding howl as the souls left each of the twelve original warrior's bodies.  Flame Caster & Mystical Lightening were so filled with grief that thousands of lightening bolts were striking everywhere in the world. killing the Dark side and evil of all kind, tornados crossed the world leveling buildings that were owned by the Dark side, a nuclear bomb more powerful then all of the governments nuclear technology destroyed all of the Dark sides caverns and dungeons. Nothing was left of what once had been the Dark side and the evil working for them.  All of the warriors went back to the palace where Charmelmystic met them.  'Your Grand parents are fine and so are their warriors.' She told them smiling lovingly at everyone. 'Mystical Lightening and Flame Caster are the High Priest and Priestess, everyone who fought in the war today may make this your permanent home and continue on working for the Higher Power.' She told them, as her smile was so angelic looking.  'Why couldn't we see them one last time?' Mystic Caster asked as tears fell down her face. 'I miss my mother so much, I need her to come back here, to our home. 'She cried into Lightening casters chest. 'Oh mama, please come back to me.' she pleaded.  Charmelmystic looked at her grand daughter with such sadness. 'They need this time to make the transitions, one day they will visit you.' she told them, she knew the pain that Mystic Caster felt and it broke her heart. Knowing there wasn't anything else she could say or do; she blew them all a kiss and vanished into a golden sparkling mist.  It had been a year since the passing of the twelve warriors of the white light power; Flame Caster went to the lighthouse where his grand parents always went. He sat quietly as he watched the light house turning into the night. He kissed twelve roses and threw them into the water when he heard the sound of voices laughing, when he saw twelve sparkling energy balls chasing each other and vanishing into the night. He smiled knowing they had come to tell him they were happy. At that moment Ninja appeared next to him on the bench. 'I know boy, one day we will all be reunited again.' He said petting Ninja and then they disappeared the only thing left were three sparkling lights above the water. 'Dumb dog, Let go of my pant leg Ralph!' Mystic shadow can be heard saying from time to time.    "
"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings Â©  On the table were breads, fruits, in the middle of the table laid Fredrick's wife, her throat had been slit and her body was slit down the middle.' Eat my queen I have waited so long for you.' He told her.  Cheyenne walked to the dead woman where she reached in and grabbed her heart as she began to devour it, blood ran down her face.' Perfect you remembered how I liked it after three hundred years.' She laughed wickedly eating the heart.   Soon the others began to feast on the dead woman's body as they rejoiced the return of their queen. Otis stood next to her and ran his hand down her back softly. She looked into his eyes with the knowledge of a secret they both shared. Fredrick would be leaving again to prepare a new place where they would continue their plan to capture the world.  'Gore warrior you are to protect my queen as long as I am gone and to see she wants for nothing.' He said to Otis as he kissed her on the lips. 'I will return in three days my queen.' He told her as he was leaving.  'I am sure I will be in good hands.' She said as she looked deep into his eyes. 'Meet me in my room.' She whispered to him.  Once in her room she waited for Otis to join her, she slipped out of her clothes and laid on the bed nude until he came to her. He walked into the room and smiled.  ' I have waited three hundred years to be reunited with you.' He said removing his clothes.  'Have you arranged for his demise so we may rule our kingdom together?' she asked watching him remove his clothes.  'Yes my Queen. 'He told her joining her in bed.  'Feed me my love as I have a burning with in for you to put out.' She told him as he raised his body over hers.  'I will pleasure you my queen.' He said as he roughly took her in a heat of passion.  'Kill him tonight! I order you as your queen to do this task I have given you.' She whispered in his ear as he ravished her body sending her into a frenzy of orgasms.  His face began to turn into a grotesque monster as Cheyenne's eyes began to glow green. 'Where is my child?' she asked Otis after their mating.  He rose from the bed and began to dress, he looked at her and smile.  ' The Princess of darkness has not been born yet, but soon very soon you will have her in your arms.' He told her.  'Why is the woman who has her in her body not here so my child can be getting the foods it need?' she questioned him.  'Fredrick wanted to wait until we got the woman that you are the hostess of her body.' He told her as he was getting ready to leave.  'Go now and I will decide how long this woman will wait before I have her here.' She told him.  The Queen of darkness put black tight pants that exposed her ass cheeks, with a halter top and black boots.' I think I will go adventuring out today.' She said looking in the mirror at her self. Then she disappeared into green smoke.  She appeared in front of Cheyenne's and Hanks house where she saw Kimberly eating ice cream on the porch as she stood behind the trees. I will take pleasure cutting my child out of your nasty fat body. She thought to herself when a hand touched her shoulder. As she turned it was Saunders standing in front of her. She smiled looking into his eyes as her eyes glowed green preventing him from moving. She ran her hands over his chest.' I am hungry 'she said licking his neck with her tongue. She wrapped her arms around him, she was ready to feed on his neck, but a bitter sweet memory of him and her playing football with other police officers flashed through her mind making her turn away and vanished before she could kill him. Back in her room she looked in the mirror. ' So Cheyenne you are a strong willed woman, but I will over power you and destroy you forever!' she said throwing herself on the bed frustrated that Cheyenne was able to stop her from completing her feeding on the man.   Cheyenne smiled at her floating above the bed. 'Then be prepared to battle to the death, I will not give up so easily.' She said with her arms folded looking at the Queen of Darkness pouting on the bed.  The queen of darkness smashed the mirror on the dresser with a lamp, 'Bitch!' She snarled and walked out to where the others were, singling out one of her own men.' Come to my room now.' she told him looking around to make sure no one noticed her and her own warrior going to her room.  In her room the man stood before her as she wrapped her arms around him.' Pleasure me the Queen of darkness now. 'She said as she was tricking him into bed with her.  Feeling frustrated and defeated out one killing by Cheyenne the Queen of the Dark side straddled her warrior as he caressed her large breast, she moved her hips slowly on him, she lowered her face to his kissing him, licking him, and once she was at his neck she reached her orgasm and then biting into his neck she began sucking the life out of him, she then continued to eat into his throat satisfying her hunger. When she had finished she looked at his body with out life.' Mmmm finger licking good.' She laughed wickedly as the man's body disappeared with one swipe of her hand and her eyes glowed a bright green.  Saunders stood looking around wondering what had just happened. Where had the woman disappeared to, she had been at this very spot. Dumb founded he went back to the house where Roger and Hank were reading up on the super natural.  ' Something weird just happened to me, a woman half dressed was watching the house and when I grabbed her she disappeared. The strange thing was I almost felt Cheyenne was there.' he told the men feeling a chill run through his body.  'Hank looked at him.' What did she look like?' he asked trying to under stand what was happening and where was his wife.  Like Cheyenne only with long black hair, her eyes glowed green then everything seemed to stop and she was gone.' he told him looking more confused then before.  Roger put his head down. 'God please help us before it is too late.' He said feeling totally lost as well as Cheyenne being lost to him forever.  Suddenly the whole house began to shake around them.' What is happening?' Norma asked jumping up from the couch.  Kimberly began to violently vomit green slime, her body began to twirl in a circle she disappeared into thin air before their very eyes.  Norma screamed as her body was too paralyzed to move.' Oh my Sweet Jesus saves us!' she screamed out.  The rumbling finally subsided; they all looked at each other not believing what had just taken place. Saunders went to the place Kimberly had been sitting.' She has been taken as well.' He said looking at the others.  Norma was screaming hysterically.' They are going to get all of us one at a time!' she said falling to her knees.  Roger went to her and he picked her up off the ground.' Pull your self together! We have to get out of here.' he told them.  Hank looked at him.' Where the fuck are we going to go?' he yelled not knowing how to feel or act.  There was a loud banging at the door; they all looked at it not knowing who could be on the other side. Hank walked slowly to the door as he opened it slowly he saw Aggatha standing at the door.  Hank swung the door open causing the woman to be startled.' What the fuck do you want?' Hank bellowed at the elderly woman.  'Please if you want your wife and friend back you need me.' She said holding up her hand that displayed a cross in her palm almost as if it had been branded there.  Roger came up behind Hank.' Let's hear what she has to say since we have no other avenues at this time.' He told Hank grabbing him by the shoulder.' Come in Aggatha.' He said pulling Hank away from the door.  The woman walked through the house looking around.' I feel much love here; I feel your wife's soul has escaped here for safety since the demonic has no love, only lust.' She told them.  Hank's face turned white.' she's dead?' he said softly.  'No she has just escaped here so her soul would not have to dwell with evil every second.' She explained to them.' today when her friend there Detective Saunders was about to be attacked and killed she jumped back inside of the Queen of darkness evidently she won seeing he is still alive.' She said looking at Saunders.  'You work for them why should we believe you?' Hank asked.  ' No I work for the power of the white light as some of you know it as God and it was Roger's and Norma's cry out to him for help that he sent me to you' she explained as she looked at Norma.' There is only one way to convince you, I will allow you to see Cheyenne.' She said turning off the lights.  Suddenly a bright white light lit up the whole room Cheyenne appeared dressed in a long white gown, bare foot, her long blond hair flowing, she smiled down at them. 'Aggatha is good, but she is right they have to be stopped soon or I will not be able to get back into my body and they will have won. You must save Kimberly's unborn child, they want to turn it evil to destroy everything good on earth.' she smiled looking so angelic.' I love you all and its that, that gives me the power I need to fight back.' she said as she faded away.  Hank looked at where Cheyenne had been.  ' Cheyenne don't go!' he cried out to her as she faded away into thin air.' How do we defeat them to get her back?' he asked Aggatha.  'You must have them all in one area of a room where they cannot escape us, if one slips through it will not stop.' She told them.  'What about the baby?' Roger asked.   'If we obtain the child soon after birth we can save her from evil.' She said as she stood with her hands folded around a rosary.' We need to get started to find where they are.' She said going to the kitchen table.  'What you don't know where their at?' Saunders asked.  'If I did I could have destroyed them long ago, so now we must do it together,' she told them folding out a map.  'What are all these marks on the map?' Roger asked her.  'These are abandoned old mansions, the ones marked have been checked, and we don't have time to waste, we must find the right one.' She said.  A white feather floated down onto the map, they all looked at each other.' Cheyenne must have sent this, she is growing weak. Does anyone know of this place?' Aggatha asked.  'It's the Feinstein's old mansion in the middle of the woods, legend has it that the husband killed his family and disappeared from sight never to be found.' Roger told them.  'Roger his first name was Fredrick, he was having an affair with a woman practicing witch craft. His wife's heart and all of her organs had been eaten from what rumors have it.' Saunders said.  'Why didn't we notice him from the pictures we got of Harrelson?' Hank asked.  'He would be two hundred years old Mr. Thompson.' Aggatha told him.  'He holds his age well. ' Hank replied.  'I must remind you that if the body it's self is shot or anything of that nature the human sharing the body will parish also.' She told them.  'So how do we kill them with out killing the victims?' Saunders asked.  'With this vial of potion I have here.' She told him holding a gold and black vial in her hand.  'This is in the movies for Christ sake.' Roger told her.  'No only wooden stakes and silver bullets are. If this potion is placed on the weapon it will kill the demonic beings as well as the human.' She told them.  'So how do we get this stuff on them? Walk up to them telling them to hold out their arm?' Hank asked Aggatha.  'When attacking you must splash it on them anywhere you can make contact.' She told them.  'So when do we go?' Hank asked her.  'Tomorrow after we have pulled the land records, we need the lay out of the house so we are not wasting time searching every inch.' She told them.  ' We should all sleep in this room together so we make it through the night with each one of you wearing these amulets to help protect you.' She said handing out the amulets.  They slept on the floor on pellets as the elderly lady sat up watching over them as she said prayers that sounded to the others as chants. She never slept as she was protecting her innocents from evil attacking them as they slept. Cheyenne's spirit could be felt in the house for Ralph and Ninja lay by the rustic table near the chair she always sat in when she was home.  The Queen of darkness was becoming restless when Otis came back.' I need to be fed now.' She hissed at him.  'Well my Queen here is the heart of Fredrick you can start with then I will take you to find new meat.' He told her smiling.  'You accomplished his demise! Come and share his heart with me so we both acquire his powers.' She told him as she held the still beating heart in her hand smiling at it so wickedly.  As the two demons devoured the Prince of darkness heart the wind began to blow harder , lightening was crackling all over the room, they both began to glow a brighter green they began to scream a horrendous scream as their bodies began to turn into demonic creatures more grotesque then they were before.  The Queen of darkness feeling the new powers serge through her looked at Otis.' I wish to go test them now.' She told him. 'As soon as my child is born she will be the Princess of Darkness.' She said laughing.  'Lets go, I know of a bar in town that even the law officials want to be rid of.' He told her as they left  .' I guess we will be helping them.' She told him as they left to go to feed.  As they arrived at the small biker bar the queen of darkness and now the new prince of darkness changed their attire to fit into the biker crowd .' how do I look?' she Asked Otis.  He looked at her in black shorts cut above her ass cheeks, thigh high boots, a top made out of only strings with just enough material covering her large hardened nipples, her long black hair hanging loosely.'  'You look great.' He told her as he stood before her in a black Harley shirt, black vest with a patch that said ' DEMONS', blue jeans with boots, a wallet hanging from a chain off of his belt.  'Lets go I want to feed.' She told him.  Once inside she spotted two women sitting at the bar these were to be hers. She sat next to the one with large breast, her hair was long and red, her jeans fit her body tightly, and she wore silver jewelry.' Hi' the woman said as she sat next to her.  'Hi I am Cheyenne.' She told them looking at the woman's large breast.  'Like what you see?' she asked  'I like what I see very much.' She told her smiling as she touched the woman on her shoulder letting fingers slide down to her cleavage.  The woman's friend leaned over to introduce herself to Cheyenne.' Hi baby I am horny and I just love what I see of that package of yours.' The woman told the princess of darkness.  'Really, well let me get a better view of you.' She said as she walked over to her bar stool. As she looked over the slim blond wearing a red dress with strings on the sides holding the dress together, she touched her small breast softly then leaned over softly kissing her neck. The woman responding to her advances opened her legs so the queen of darkness could touch her bare crotch.  ' Mmmm horny I think you will enjoy my eating you.' The queen of darkness smiled as she moved her hand under the woman's dress feeling the woman's moistness as her hips began to move to her touch.  The others in the bar were yelling for a three some between the three women as the one with the large breast removed her top as the princess of darkness began to lick her hardened nipples. Everyone was encouraging them to continue with the sex acts. The Queen of darkness looked at the large breasted woman who removed the Queen of darkness clothes for her. The woman grabbed her as she felt of her breast, kissing her softly. The Queen of darkness then dropped to her knees where she began to give the smaller woman oral sex as the men and women were going wild. With out the others realizing it Otis had locked any way out of the bar.  Otis had a woman on the pool table performing anal sex on her. A large male biker grabbed the Queen of darkness kissing her as he caressed her large breast.' You bitches are driving me crazy.' he said as he roughly threw the Queen of darkness on the bar, he entered her body as she moaned from the pleasure. The women and the men began to have sex with each other like they were under a spell of some kind. The man who was with the Queen of darkness was just getting ready to explode in side of her when her eyes began to glow as she bit out a piece of his throat then spitting it on the smaller woman who was oblivious to what was taking place around her. Otis had turned into his demonic self and ripped the woman's heart out of her chest, He began to eat it as he exploded his juices with in her. The others in the bar were oblivious to what was happening to their friends. The Queen of darkness grabbed the large breasted woman 'pleasure me now!' she ordered her. As the princess of darkness lay on the bar having sex with the woman while the smaller woman was kissing and caressing her breast. She grabbed the smaller woman ripping her heart from her chest continuing her sexual frenzy with her friend as she ate the other woman's heart. After the hour of sex and feeding frenzy everyone in the bar was dead. She approached Otis. 'Pleasure me my prince.' She said laying on the pool table where they began to have sex amongst the blood and gore. He entered her giving her the orgasm she wanted now that she had been fed to satisfy her hunger.  The next day Hank was able to get the lay out of the house so they could study it.' When are we going?' he asked Aggatha.  'Tonight we must attack at midnight.' She instructed them.  The day seemed to go by so slowly for them. Norma turned on the television set to the news where they saw the Prince and Queen of darkness had attacked the bar the night before.  The news reporter a young Latin male was recanting what the owner of the bar found when he opened the doors for the cleaning crew. 'Last night at a local tavern frequented by local bikers the authorities were alerted to a bloody massacre by the owner of the establishment and the cleaning crew that happened upon the grizzly scene of the blood and mutilations of the patrons along with the bar matron. One witness was heard saying that the body organs were gone from the victims as if they were had been ripped out of their bodies. At this time there aren't any suspects to this bloody massacre. Stay tuned for further information.'  Roger and Saunders looked at each other.' We have to stop this before they kill everyone.' Roger said unsure tonight would even work that they may end up amongst the victims.  'Oh my God how are we going to carry this out?' Norma asked.  'With the help of the almighty, that is how.' Aggatha told her.  Hank sat in his bedroom listening to Cheyenne's favorite song, He stopped loving her today. He sat hunched over holding her picture in his hands the tears fell like tender rain drops onto the picture. Roger came into the room, he knew the big mans heart was being torn apart. He sat next to him on the bed putting his arm around his shoulder.' I am not going to tell you we will get her back alive Hank, because I just do not know, in fact, I do not know if any of us will make it out alive. What I do know is that you have to use the love you two have for each other to help fight this thing.' He told him as he tried to comfort him and be honest at the same time with him.  Hank took a deep breath looking at Roger.' I guess you better use that love that fills your heart for her too it will have twice the fighting chance.' He said handing him her picture.  Roger smiled fighting back tears.' Well then with the two of us fighting for her she's got one hell of a fighting chance.' He told Hank trying to force a laugh as he looked at her picture wishing she was here and safe.  Saunders had seen what had just happened between the two men, she is some kind of a woman that is for sure. He thought to himself as the men entered the room.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Kimberly was tied to a bed in a room where the queen of darkness came to her with a plate of spleen, hearts and intestines.' I have brought food for my child to feed on.' she told her.  'Your child? No, it is my child.' Kimberly told her.  'You fat ugly bitch that child you carry was fathered by Fredrick to be the ruler of the dark side.' She yelled at Kimberly as she grabbed her face digging her nails into her flesh.  'You've made a mistake; the father is James Weston from Tennessee.' She told her crying.  'No you ignorant sow; it was Fredrick using another human form to impregnate you.' She told her. 'I will take great pleasure in killing you myself tonight after my child is born. Now eat!'  Kimberly looked at the human organs on the plate and began to gag.  ' I can't eat that!' She cried pushing the plate away from her.  'Yes you can and will!' she yelled shoving the heart into her mouth.  ' Now eat it or I will kill you now!' she ordered.  Kimberly tried to eat it, she gagged with each bite feeling as if she would vomit at any second as the woman kept shoving it in her mouth.  'You will eat every bite of this food, and then we must prepare you for its birth' she told her shoving the intestines in her mouth.' Eat it!' She yelled grabbing her by the face digging her long sharp black nails into the sides of her cheeks again. The woman grabbed a glass of blood after she ate everything on the plate.' Drink this; it is the blood of her father... Fredrick.' She told her pouring the glass of blood down her throat. The Queen of darkness ordered her people to take her to cleanse her body so the birth may begin.  Kimberly began to cry.' It's not time! I am only six months pregnant, you will kill the baby if you take it too early!' she pleaded trying to spare her life as well as her child's.  'Shut up you fat ugly cow!' the woman screamed at her. 'Now take this repugnant creature so my child may be born.'  They took Kimberly to a room full of lit candles, she was placed on a table screaming, and under it was a large circle with a star in the middle. Kimberly was crying hysterically as they gagged her mouth and tied her arms and legs apart on the table. The people in the room surrounded the table as they began to chant words that Kimberly could not understand.  The Queen and Prince of darkness stood beside the table in long black robes with hoods over their heads. 'Let us begin the birth of the child.' Otis spoke in a demonic voice.  Kimberly began screaming as the large knife began to cut into her flesh, the pain was unbearable for her, her screams could be heard through out the entire house and woods. It was not long before they lifted the child out of her womb and wrapped it in a black cloth. The Princess of darkness turned to the unconscious Kimberly with the large dagger and with one swipe slit her throat. 'Feast my people and rejoice the Princess of darkness birth,' she said holding the baby in the air over her head. Kimberly's lifeless body was then devoured by the demonic creatures surrounding her.  The Queen of darkness held the child in her arms proud that she had gotten what she wanted most .' you my child will rule all of the dark side bringing death, plagues, chaos amongst the earth.' She said feeding the child from her breast that had filled with milk.' Yes my little princess feed from mother.' She told the baby as her eyes glowed  It was time to go to the old mansion to do battle with the demons; the ride was quiet as they prayed to the heavens protect them. They parked the car on the side of the road by the woods as they began their journey. As they were walking all of their flash lights went dead.' What caused that to happen?' Norma asked.  'Evil is trying to stop us.' She told them as she kept walking.  'How will we see our way through the woods?' Saunders asked he was unable to see two feet in front of him it was so black.  A brilliant light glowed above them as Cheyenne motioned for them to follow her. She led the way to the abandoned mansion. They were following her through the halls until she disappeared from sight.  'Where did she go?' Hank asked trying to find her.  'Where she is needed the most.' Aggatha told them. 'We must hurry.' She told them.  They could feel the evil around them as they walked down the hall to a large wooden door. Aggatha opened it slowly.' Their in there, Norma no matter what, keep this door locked letting no one out. Here is a vial for you, do not use it all at once, a few drops on their skin will release them from the bodies and back where they belong.' She said handing each one of them a vial with the potion.  They entered the room; the demons began walking slowly towards them, hissing at them with their distorted faces. Aggatha began repeating a verse.' With this potion, send these demons from whence they come, setting their trip to hell in motion.' She kept repeating it repeatedly.  The drops hit each demon; they fell to the ground returning back into the women who were abducted. When Hank hit Otis with the potion who was now in his pure demonic form, with huge ears, his body was like a lizard with a long tail that he would whip around his body, smoke rose off his skin as he screamed out in torment then burst into flames. They saw Cheyenne's body fall to the floor before they could hit the Queen of darkness with the potion, Cheyenne had been able to pull the evil witches soul from her body and they battled. The Queen of darkness was trying to destroy her so she could remain in Cheyenne's body.  The Queen of darkness was throwing balls of fire at Cheyenne and at everyone else in the room. They sought cover from her. Cheyenne began to repeat the verse that Aggatha was repeating as she raised her hand with a snow-white glowing ball in her hand hitting the Queen of darkness with it causing her to explode into a ball of fire, all the demons followed her into the ball and exploded.  They all watched Cheyenne's soul hovering above her body lying on the floor then slowly she went back into her body. She laid their still without any movement from her. Hank ran to her picking her up into his arms.' Don't you leave me now Cheyenne, come back baby I love you.' He said cradling her in his arms.  Cheyenne looked up into his eyes smiling; she was weak from her battle.' I love you Hank,' she whispered wrapping her arms around him.' I felt so much love coming at me from all directions making me stronger to beat the Dark Side.' She told him with her eyes closed a look of peace on her face.  Hank looked at Roger.' It was mine and Rogers love for you that you were feeling that gave you the strength.' He told her giving Roger the credit he deserved.  Hank helped Cheyenne to stand up and she hugged Roger, 'I will never let you take that love away from me, as I will never take my love that I have for you away.' She told him kissing him softly on his lips. She looked over to where Kimberly's mutilated body still lay on the table.' Oh sweet Jesus!' she cried out.' They killed her, I wasn't in time!' She cried into Rogers's chest.  They heard the baby crying under the table.  ' It's still alive!' Aggatha said as she reached under the table.' We must get her to the hospital quickly.' She said looking at Cheyenne.  ' You my child have been chosen to watch over her and to protect her.'  Cheyenne smiled taking the tiny infant in her arms.' I will protect you little one, we all will be here to protect you.' She said smiling down at the newly born infant not weighing more then a pound.  They all waited at the hospital where the baby was placed in NICU until they could get her weight from 2 lbs to 5lbs before she could leave the hospital.  As they were leaving the hospital Roger looked at Aggatha.' Where do you go from here?' he asked looking at the sweet old woman.  'As it turns out I am seeking a nanny job.' She said smiling at Hank and Cheyenne.  Everyone yelled at one time.' Your hired!' they all began laughing as the other women's families showed up to be reunited with them.  'Remember we all must keep quiet of what really took place.' Aggatha told them.' Or they may remove the child from us and that cannot happen if we are to protect her.'  Hank, Cheyenne and Aggatha went back to the house Aggatha looked at Cheyenne from the back seat.' Cheyenne we will need to talk because my child your life is no longer as it once was. You and the other women have been chosen to fight off evil for ever, not just this one time. Every day that passes you will notice more powers given to you.' She said trying to break this to her easy.  Cheyenne turned to look at Aggatha from the front seat. 'What are you trying to say Aggatha?' she asked feeling this was something she really didn't want to hear.  'I was around when Fredrick killed his family those many years ago.' She told her seeing the confusion in her face.   'Your over two hundred years old?' Hank asked with a look of disbelief.  'We will talk more at the house.' Aggatha told them.  The rest of the ride was silent as they each wondered what was going to happen to their once normal lives.  Once inside the house they all sat at the table, Aggatha taking a deep breath.' The good thing about this Cheyenne, you and the other women will never age. You have been chosen since birth to defend goodness against all evil.' She said trying to make this is easy on her.  'Never age? But we all age, how else do we grow old and die?' she asked her beginning to understand, but not really wanting to accept what has happened.  'Yes mortals live and die while there are some who die and are chosen to come back to conquer evil.' Aggatha told her wishing she could take her into her arms.  With a look of fear on her face. 'I am dead is what your telling me?' she asked.  'You were dead, but you were sent back with certain conditions and powers.' She told her.  'What about Hank? I will have to go through eternity without him?' she said as tears came to her eyes.  'Only after he lives and dies from old age, you will be able to live a normal husband and wife relationship until then.' She told them.  'How will I know when I get these powers and how to use them?' Cheyenne asked.  'You will know when you obtain them and it will be natural to use them to you as if you always had them.' She explained.' We will tell the other ones tomorrow. Oh and we all must relocate to another location.' she told them as it all sank into Cheyenne's and Hanks minds.' As for the child we must be grateful that she did not have time to suckle from the breast of the Queen of darkness other wise her blood would have been past through the milk to the infant and we would have had to kill her.' Aggatha said as the thought was distasteful to her.' Even though Fredrick's blood flows through her body he was not always evil, there was a time he was good and the only woman he ever loved through all these years was a powerful warrior of the white light as he him self was.' Aggatha told them as tears wailed up in her eyes. 'Then he became greedy and wanted more and turned to the Dark Side as their leader.  'What became of the one he loved?' Cheyenne asked Aggatha.   'His love for her was not strong enough to keep him from killing her.' Aggatha said thinking of that horrible night.' Enough, you will learn more later.' She told Cheyenne.  Cheyenne and Hank retired to their bedroom, Cheyenne was reluctant to have sexual relations with him after her ordeal with the demons sexual rituals they had put her body through, she could still see Gore warrior's face pleasuring himself using her body to do it.  Hank became upset with her resisting him. 'Are you trying to tell me I remind you of him?' he asked feeling angered by her refusing his sexual advances.  'No damn it! I do not want sex with anyone!' she yelled smashing her vase with the carnations with just one glance at it. 'Well I guess I have a power now!' She said going to the patio to sit and think.  Roger lay out on the couch listening to the argument wishing he could comfort her, but knowing he could not do anything without provoking Hank.   Six years later.  The whole household was preparing for Gina's birthday, Norma baked her a birthday cake in the shape of a teddy bear. The other women were busy decorating the house with streamers and balloons, the men had bought her a brand new bicycle, with a baby doll in a small cradle .Aggatha brought the child down stairs dressed in a white lace dress, with white anklets around the tops of them, her long brown hair was in long curly ringlets.  'Here is the birthday girl.' Aggatha said as she brought Gina to the kitchen where her cake was waiting with six candles on it.  Gina looked at the cake smiling as they lit the candles for her.' Do I get to blow them out now?' she asked so sweetly.  'Yes Gina, blow out the candles then make a wish.' Norma told her as everyone stood around the table singing happy birthday to her.  Gina blew out all the candles on the cake then sat in a chair for her cake and ice cream.  ' Hurry so I open my gifts.' She said smiling.   Norma fixed everyone a plate of the cake and ice cream, as everyone was about to eat Gina threw her plate on the floor.' I hate strawberry cake you moron!' she yelled at Norma.  'That is enough Gina!' Cheyenne yelled at the little girl with a very stern expression.  'I am so sorry Cheyenne.' She said looking at her sadly.  'Maybe we shouldn't give you any gifts for your actions here at the table!' Cheyenne fumed as she scolded the child.  Gina looking at her lap with tears flowing down her cheeks.' Please Cheyenne please! I will eat the cake. I am sorry grandma for being bad.' Gina said looking up from her lap.  'You better eat every piece of cake and ice cream, then maybe and only maybe you can have your gifts.' she told her.   'Now before you eat you will clean up that mess you made.' She told the child pointing at the broken plate on the floor.  Gina cleaned up the mess she made from her temper tantrum; she then sat at the table eating her cake and ice cream. After everyone had finished they led Gina into the living room with a scarf around her eyes so she could not see her gifts waiting for her. Gina opened all her gifts with excitement; she hugged the baby placing her in the cradle. When she saw her new pink bike that had a bell , a white basket and pink and white fringe hanging from the handles she was very pleased.' Oh thank you!' she said with a huge smile.' You're the best family!' she told them looking at her new bike. 'May I ride it now?' she asked them with an angelic expression.  'Change into your play clothes first.' Lindsey told her.  'Alright!' she yelled excited to be able to ride her new bike.  The rest of the afternoon Gina rode her bike around the grounds of the farm. She would laugh as she tried to run the chickens over with her bike. She spent the day tormenting the animals when no one was watching her, Ralph and Ninja lay under the tractor growling and hissing at the child.  That night Gina was to start school the next day, which the rest of the household was grateful it meant they would have a break from the high-strung child.  Morning soon came and time for Gina to get ready for her first day of school, Norma dressed her in a red corduroy dress that buttoned at the shoulders, a white long sleeve shirt, with white knee high socks and black paten shoes, and her hair was pulled up in a pony tail. When Gina entered, her class she was seated next to a little girl with blond curly hair named Sammy who was dressed in a pink ruffled dress, pink anklet with black paten leather shoes.   Gina saw the little girl's necklace with a ruby stone and Gina wanted it.' I'll give you this candy bar for your necklace.' She told Sammy.  'No my grand ma gave it to me before she died last year.' She told Gina.  Gina gave Sammy a dirty look for she wanted that necklace. At recess, Gina played with Sammy on the swings when she saw some woods.  ' let's go into the woods and look around,' she told her new friend.  'Ok, but not too far or we will get into trouble.' Sammy told her as they ran into the woods just as the recess bell rang for them to return to class.' we have to go.' She told Gina turning around to go back to class.  'Wait what is over in that tree?' Gina asked walking over to it as Sammy followed behind her.  Mrs. Harris came to the edge of the woods 'come out of there and return to class!' She yelled into the woods.  Gina came running out of the woods.' Sammy is still in there, I told her to come on but she went running deeper into the woods!' She told the teacher acting so concerned.  'Well come on Gina, I will tell the principle he will go find her.' Mrs. Harris told her as she put her hand on Gina's back leading her towards the school building.  As they were walking Gina looked back over her shoulder.' I wonder what she is doing in there? ' Gina asked the teacher.  'Getting into trouble that is what she is doing.' Mrs. Harris told her.  Once back in class Gina kept looking at the door but no one ever came in. the school bell rang at the end of the day.' Why didn't Sammy come back to class Mrs. Harris?' she asked her teacher as she was grading papers.  'She probably spent the rest of the day in the principles office.' She told her not looking up from her paper work.' Now go on your parents will be waiting for you.' Her teacher said never looking up once.  'See you tomorrow Mrs. Harris.' Gina told her with a huge smile on her face until she ran to the hallway where she saw three police officers standing in the hallway. Gina quickly ran out side to catch her ride home with Hank.  Hank saw the police cars as he pulled up in front of the school; he waited outside the car until he saw Gina.' How was school today?' he asked her as he opened her car door.  'Fine I got to swing on the swing set today. Do you think we could get a swing set at home Hank?' she asked him as they drove past the police cars.  'We will see what kind of grades you have on your report card and if they are good then yes.' He told her as they drove home.  When they pulled up in front of the house Roger was sitting on the front porch.' Gina I need to ask you a question.' He told her.  'What do you want to ask me Roger?' she asked him as she sat next to him on the bench swing.  'You told your teacher you saw Sammy running deeper into the woods at recess.' He told her taking her hand.  'Yes we heard the bell and I told her we better go back, but she went running more into the woods saying she saw something, then Mrs. Harris called and I told her Sammy just kept running into the woods.' She told him with wide eyes.' is Sammy in trouble?' she asked him.  'No Gina, Sammy is not in trouble, did you see anyone else in the woods?' he asked her looking at her face.  'No Roger I didn't see no one else.' Gina told him with a curious look.  'Sammy got hurt in the woods today and she won't be going back to school anymore.' He told her as he was filled with sorrow.  'Why won't she be going back to school?' she asked Roger looking even more curious then ever.  'Sammy went to heaven today.' Roger told her as gently as he could as tears came to his eyes remembering how her tiny body laid lifeless and mangled.  'No! She was my friend!' Gina yelled as she ran to her room slamming the door behind her.  Hank looked at Roger, 'what happened in the woods?' he asked knowing there was more to it then Roger could tell Gina.  'Someone with brut force smashed that child's head in with a rock.' He told Hank shaking his head.' you could hardly tell she was human. Her tiny face was smashed in so badly.' He said breaking down into tears.' I am going to find that bastard who did this to that kid and I pray he tries to smash me with a rock!' Roger said with his hand on his gun and the look of hate in his eyes.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 05 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Gina laid in her bed smiling as she dangled the ruby red necklace over her as she watched how the light made it sparkle. She quickly got up and hid the necklace deep in her toy box. 'No one will find you in here,' she said then going back to her bed when she heard someone coming.  Cheyenne walked into the room seeing the child lying on her bed crying.' Are you ok sweetie?' Cheyenne asked sitting on the side of the bed stroking Gina's hair as she lay on her stomach crying.  'Why did she have to go to heaven for?' she asked Cheyenne.  'That is where good people go to live when they die here on earth.' Cheyenne explained to her.  'Leave me alone I don't want to talk to anyone.' Gina told her.  Cheyenne left her alone as she went to her room where Hank was sitting.' Who would kill a child?' he asked trying to find an answer.  'Someone very sick or very evil did this.' Cheyenne told him.  'Have you had any visions?' he asked her.  'No not this time.' She said sitting on the bed with her head down as she failed an innocent child whose life was taken before her time was up on earth.   'Why did I not get a vision? Why was that child sacrificed to evil?' she cried out in pain as tears streaked her face.  'I am going to go shower,' she told him patting his hand letting him know she was ok. As the hot water ran down her face it felt so relaxing as she opened her eyes the water had turned to blood running down her body.  ' Oh my God!' she said realizing it was an illusion trying to tell her something. I need to go look around the area where the child was murdered. She thought to her self. The water began to run clear then. Realizing this is what something was trying to tell her.' ok I got your message loud and clear.' she said as she finished showering. Cheyenne grabbed a pair of black jeans, a white blouse with black stripes; she put on a pair of black boots that just fit around her ankles. She wore her hair up a ponytail as she noticed her hair was starting to turn dark brown. 'Want to ride with me to the crime scene Hank?' she asked as he was lying across on the bed on his back in just a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers.  ' Sure let me put a shirt on.' He told her putting on a blue t-shirt.  As they were going out the door she grabbed his ass.' We may not make it to the crime scene you keep that up.' He said smiling at her.  As they drove to the school, Cheyenne thought to her self what am I suppose to find. They saw Roger and Saunders standing by their car. Cheyenne got out of the car walking up to the two men.' May we see the crime scene?' she asked as she saw how disturbed they were by the looks on their faces.  'Yeah maybe you can figure out who did it so we can accidentally slip a rock into the monsters skull!' Saunders told them hoping that Cheyenne would see something they could not.  As the four of them walked to where the murder happened Cheyenne saw the rock was still there that had been used to kill the child. The crime scene unit had not removed it yet, she bent over to pick it up. As soon as Cheyenne picked it up she suddenly fell to the ground backing up as fast as she could as if she was trying to escape from something horrible, she began screaming and covering her head with her arms as if to stop something from hitting her.' No! Please!' Cheyenne began screaming, her body jerking uncontrollably then she past out as a trickle of blood ran down from her mouth.  Hank held her in his arms.' She must have seen something that scared the hell out of her.' He told them trying to revive her.  'Out of all the years I have known this feisty lady, this is the first time I have seen her so scared.' Roger said feeling relieved when he saw she was coming too.  Cheyenne opened her eyes they were wide full of fear as her body was still slightly shaky.' It was a demon.' She told them as she cried feeling the pain of the little girl.  'Why were you so scared?' Hank asked her.  'I went into Sammy when she was being murdered, she was so frightened.' Cheyenne told them as tears fell from her eyes.' It was so ugly, green, with red glowing eyes, it had fang like teeth, long fingers nails, it just kept bashing at her head, and it took a necklace off of her neck before it finished killing her.' She said crying as she saw the death.' I guess I past out because that was when she died.' She told them using the hanker chief Roger handed her.  Cheyenne stood up looking around the woods.  ' Where ever your hiding demon from hell I plan on killing you slowly before sending you back to the fires to burn for eternity!' she yelled almost as if she wanted it to appear so she could battle it now.' I will have my day with you since I have seen you! Appear before me I demand you!' she said looking around.' You coward! Your not even worthy of being a demon!' she yelled trying to provoke it to appear in front of her. Tears ran down her face out of anger, frustration and pain from the small child's grizzly murder.  Hank put his hand on her shoulder. 'It's not going to appear Cheyenne.' He told her trying to calm her down.  'It killed her over a damned necklace!' She told them.' I plan on giving it a necklace to carry to hell with it.' She told them, she felt so angry.  Gina heard Cheyenne summoning her to appear before them and hid from her.  Hank took Cheyenne back to the house where the others were waiting. Cheyenne looked at the other women.' we have a demon that killed a child over a necklace. I want this one so bad I can taste it!' she told them as she was filled with anger.  Gina sat at the top of the stairs listening then hurried back to her bedroom.' Cheyenne can not find out it was me, not until I am older then I will destroy them all.' She said to herself sitting on her bed grinning as she thought of their destruction.' I will revenge my parent's death and rule my kingdom as it is meant to be.' She said lying down on her bed.' I will have to create a diversion.' She said smiling so evilly.  The next few weeks everything was quiet even Gina who was being very well behaved. Cheyenne and the other women worked out everyday to keep them selves in shape. A young man with black hair, blue eyes and muscular build, came up to the house with his shirt hanging out of his tight blue jeans, his cowboy boots had cleats on them. He singled Cheyenne out of the group.' I was wondering if you had a few odd jobs I could do and a place to lie down at night, the barn would be great.' He said looking deep into her eyes like he was reading her soul.  Cheyenne felt herself not being able to take her eyes away from his as if he was putting her in a trance as she looked back into his eyes her words were slowly spoken. 'We can find something for you to do here,' she said still not taking her eyes from his.  'May I sleep in your barn?' he asked as he smiled showing the whitest teeth she had ever seen.  'Yes of course you may.' She answered as she was acting even stranger now.  He held his hand out for her to shake it; as soon as their hands met she had a tingling sensation going through her body.' Thank you misses. Sorry I didn't get your name,' he told her.  'It's Cheyenne,' she said still in a trance like state.  'If it would not be too much trouble could you show me where I will be sleeping and what ever you wish of me to do for you?' He told Cheyenne as he eyed her body up and down smiling as if he was taking her clothes off.  'Yes come with me.' She told him as she walked to the barn as he had his hand on the small of her back.  The other women watched as Cheyenne walked away with the man.  ' We better go tell Aggatha, Cheyenne acts like she has been put in a trance or something.' Gloria said worried about the presence of this man.  The women ran to the house where Aggatha was cooking dinner  .' Aggatha! Something is wrong with Cheyenne! This guy came up here and she acted like she was in a trance as soon as their eyes met, she is letting him sleep in the barn and work here.' Gloria told Aggatha talking so fast the woman had a hard time comprehending what she was saying.  Aggatha looked strange at the women.' Oh no it must be a warlock sent here to destroy Cheyenne since she is our strongest with the most powers.' She told the women. 'Are they in the barn now?' she asked in an agitated voice.  'Yes.' The women said in unison.  Aggatha ran to the barn where she found Cheyenne in the arms of the man as he was kissing her and holding her body tightly against his. Running his hands down her back, pressing her hips against the erection he was getting.  ' Take your hands off of her Justin!' Aggatha demanded.  Justin looked up at Aggatha from kissing Cheyenne who did not try to break away from him.' I don't think she wants me to let her go mother.' He said smiling down at Cheyenne as she was breathing heavily looking at him as he pulled her tighter to him and she began to lick his neck. 'Can't you see your stopping me from giving her what she wants?' He taunted Aggatha as he laid Cheyenne down on a haystack and placing his body on top of her.   'I should have destroyed you when I had the chance!' she told him.  'You couldn't kill your own son now mother could you?' He said taunting her even more. 'But if you want to watch us take a seat.' he told as she was kissing his neck as she ran her hands over his body.  'You have her under a spell take it off of her now Justin!' she   ordered her son.  'You should have joined forces with me and father instead of taking the side of the white light!' he yelled as he flew Aggatha up against the wall with one swipe of his hand.  'This is your strongest warrior and I am going to make her my bride to lead the Dark Side by my side.' He said running his fingers down Cheyenne's cleavage as she moaned from his touch.  Aggatha picked herself up summoning the other women who appeared by her side.' You must destroy him to break the spell he has put on Cheyenne.' She told them.  He laughed at them.' You bitches could not hurt anyone,' he laughed as he licked Cheyenne's neck while she was becoming limp in his arms.  'Cheyenne Hank loves you! Fight for him if nothing else!' Tammy yelled at her seeing she was becoming weaker in his arms.  This angered Justin he turned towards her sending her flying through the air in to a wall.' Shut up you bitch!' he ordered as he turned demonic looking.  The other women began to walk toward him when they saw Cheyenne began to move, her eyes then opened as she looked at Justin.' You have just met your match mother fucker!' she yelled at him then sent him into the wall behind him with using both of her hands without touching him. Not giving him a chance to get his senses, she sent him flying across the room. With one leap she jumped up in the air flying on top of him where they fought, as he got on top of her with his hands strangling her Tammy flew through the air hitting him directly in his head with her feet sending him flying off of Cheyenne. The women all stood together in unison.' return to the lake of hell where you whence came never to return to a place that the good and innocent dwell.' They said as they held their hands straight out at him watching the flames of fire suck him into its hole.  'Why did you not kill him?' Aggatha asked Cheyenne.  'He is your son; if you couldn't destroy him then don't expect us too. He won't come back here again.' She said as she looked disappointed at Aggatha.' Why did you lie and tell us we were Guardian angels when in fact we are witches?' She asked the elderly woman.  Aggatha looked at the women.' I did not think you could handle knowing the truth, but there are good witches who help the innocent mortals and supernatural beings that are not evil. How did you figure it out?' she asked  'I have all my powers now that is how I broke his spell on me.' She told her.  'Cheyenne you have been chosen to lead the good from birth. None of your parents were normal mortals that is why they took you eight because you were meant to be powerful warriors to save us when the time of the war of good verses evil.' She explained.  The women looked at each other.' but they can place spells on us?' Lindsey asked.  'We are just as vulnerable to spells as any other person or witch.' Cheyenne told them.' Let's go to the house.' She told them as she walked with her head down.  At the house Cheyenne was angry with her parents.' Why didn't they tell me?' why did they leave me in an orphanage?' she asked aloud.  All the women realized they were all placed in orphanages.' Why did our parents give us up?' they asked.  Just then a bright light came into the room it was the parents of the eight women.' oh, our sweet daughter we had to place you there before we were destroyed that night. We did it to protect you as did the others parents place the other girls. Fredrick had us all destroyed except for Aggatha who they let live thinking she was one of them. She did well keeping her secret until she knew you were ready to take over then moved you here.' Cheyenne's mother told her.  'To Salem for Christ sake where they killed people who they thought was witches? This is where you had her to bring us?' Cheyenne cried out.  'This was our home at one time and this is where you eight girls had to come to get your powers. Someone leaked it out to the Dark Side you girls are here. But who?' her father asked wondering who could have betrayed them.  'I suppose the one who I will be doing battle with in the future.' Cheyenne told them.' Some where there is a Princess of Darkness I will be fighting, just when I do not know.' She told them.  'We must go now; take care of your selves more will come to stop you.' Tammy's mother told them.  The women looked at each other knowing the truth, but it did not make it feel any better. Cheyenne went to the basement where she found a hidden door inside were oils, charms, candles, the tools that they would need to help them survive. She felt like she had been here before for it seemed so familiar to her when her cat Ninja ran up to her rubbing her legs.' Well boy they say witches have black cats and here we are.' She said picking the cat up in her arms.  The other women came into the room with her.' Wow look at this place.' Alicia said touching the oils.  'We use a drop of the oil in our baths it will help to give us protection against our enemies.' She told them.  'Why didn't it protect our parents?' Gloria asked.  'It was meant to be.' Cheyenne said as she found charms.  ' These must be meant for us since there are eight of them here.' She said handing each one to the women.  'Another form of protection for us.' Lindsey said.' It makes me mad that we were lied too.' She said placing her charm on her neck, as did the others.  'When do you think it will take place?' Tammy asked.  'In ten years we go to battle.' Cathy said.  'And they will keep coming before that time to destroy us.' Patty told them.      "
"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Cheyenne Sat quietly in the window as the snow glistened the ground remembering the day this all started........  The year is 1972 Cheyenne and Hank Thompson pulled their car up in front of what appeared to be a normal looking house set in a quiet neighborhood, they were not prepared for what was waiting for them on the other side of the door. An elderly lady dressed in a long black dress, black shoes, and her gray hair up in a bun greeted them. She looks like she should be in a horror flick Cheyenne thought to herself as she shook the womanâs hand.   'Come in please 'the woman spoke in almost a whisper.  Cheyenne wore a mid calf straight white skirt, a matching white cropped jacket, a light blue blouse, revealing her hour glass shape, She wore white heels, Her blonde hair worn up in a bun on top of her head, She looked at her husband Hank hesitantly as they entered the house.  'Please follow me Mrs. Harrelson is waiting for you in the den Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.' she said turning to lead them down the hall way.  'How did you know our last name?' Cheyenne asked since they had not told her who they were.  The woman turned towards Cheyenne with a humble smile. 'You are the only appointment for today my dear, so I just assumed it was you at the door,' she continued to walk down the hall slowly.  'Oh.' Cheyenne replied as she looked at the familyâs portraits hanging on the wall.  Hank a quiet man was observing their surroundings and the fact that all of the drapes were pulled shut prohibiting sunlight from entering the house. He unbuttoned the top button of his white dress shirt, he smoothed out his black dress slacks, wishing he could take off the gray jacket as he walked down the hall way, his black dress shoes could use a good shining, but he didnât have time since he woke up late this morning. God this place is depressing, he thought to himself as he smoothed his short graying hair.  The woman opened the door to the den where a young frail looking woman sat behind a large red oak desk with just a small gold desk lamp lighting the room.  'Your appointment is here Mrs. Harrelson.' The woman informed the other woman.  Cheyenne noticed how beautiful the woman was with her long red hair hanging loosely to her waist, her eyes were an Icy blue, Cheyenne noticed that with her pale white skin, the red lipstick complimented the emerald green dress she wore. Her eyes held a sadness that grabbed Cheyenneâs heart when she looked into them with her own dark brown eyes.  'Thank you for coming to see me, the sun light gives me intolerable migraines in case youâre wondering why I keep my house so dark.' The woman said as she rose from the huge brown leather chair behind the desk.  'Itâs a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Harrelson.' Hank said shaking her hand.  'Please sit down.' Mrs. Harrelson told them pointing to the two brown chairs in front of the desk.  'I want to hire you to find out what my husband is up to. You see our bank accounts are missing money , he stays away for days at a time, he says it is business, but I feel it is something more than that. I do not believe he is seeing another woman, but he has to be up to something that could cause harm to everyone around him.' Mrs. Harrelsonâs voice stayed very calm and even toned as she spoke.  'Do you have any idea as to what it could be that he is doing?' Hank asked as he sat back in his chair.  'Young women seem to disappear during the times he is gone, I can give you the dates when he has been away to help you find out if he is the one behind these womenâs disappearances.' Her eyes began to tear up as she spoke.  'You mean the rash of women that have vanished from parking lots in the last six months?' Cheyenne asked as she looked at Hank with a confused expression on her face.  'Yes.' Her tears streaked her face as she looked down at the top of her desk.  'Why didnât you just call the police?' Cheyenne asked as she crossed her legâs, she could tell the woman was in severe pain, was it from her migraines or the thought that her husband had something to do with six women disappearing without a trace of them anywhere.  'The police would have questioned him and he would have known that it was me. I donât want him knowing any of this if itâs not him.' her eyes were wide as she spoke.' Here is a note book of the dates when he left, where he was supposed to have been at on those dates. The rest you will have to find out your selves, I am willing to pay you one thousand a day that should cover any expenses and then five thousand when you know if itâs him or not.' She told them as she ran her hand over her forehead to help ease the pain of her migraine.  Hank cleared his voice as he looked at the woman.' We can start tomorrow if that is soon enough for you?' he stood up looking around the richly decorated den.  'Yes and thank you.' She told them rising up from the desk.' you will keep me informed on a daily basis correct?' she smiled at them as she held her hand out to shake theirs.  'Yes at the end of each day around six oâclock and no later then ten oâclock one of us will call you.' Cheyenne told her straightening out her skirt as she rose from the chair.  Hank and Cheyenne entered the hall way and they were met by the gray haired woman.' I will show you out.' She told them as she showed them to the front door.  Man she is creepy, Cheyenne thought to her self as she followed behind the woman. Cheyenne could not wait to be in their car for she felt something would jump out at them from behind a door as they walked by.  Once inside of the car Cheyenne was relieved to be away from the eerie little old woman.' Do you think she might be right?' she asked her husband as they drove slowly down the road.  Hank was looking at the houses around them. 'I donât know, but we were hired to find out and thatâs what we will do.' He said as he turned the car on to Federal highway.  'They have money thatâs for sure; you arenât middle class living off Bay Shore drive.' Cheyenne said as she thumbed through the note book.  At the office Cheyenne thought how Mrs. Harrelsonâs den made the office look drab with the white walls, the two brown desk and one window that Cheyenne could look out to see cars traveling down Federal high way. Cheyenne looked at the gray filing cabinets that held the clients they had acquired since they opened a year ago.  We will have a view of the ocean one day, she thought to herself.  Hank checked out the hotels that Fredrick Harrelson was suppose to stay at during the last six monthâs while Cheyenne through some of the old news papers still in their office on a table in the corner. She looked through the news archives to see if the dates matched with the dates the women who had disappeared off the face of the earth.  'Hey babe one thing they all had in common they were single, in their forties, and had brown hair, they were all very beautiful.' Cheyenne told him as she read each story.' Cheyenne noticed all the women had disappeared in the afternoon. ' well we know he strikes in the afternoon.'  'Or she.' Hank said looking up from the note book.  'Or what she?' Cheyenne asked looking at her husband puzzled by what he said.  'It could be a she, we donât know if this guy is connected in any way to these women disappearing Cheyenne.' He told her never looking up from the note book. 'I guess I should fly out to Colorado since that was the first trip he made six months ago right at the time when the first disappearance occurred, maybe I can find out something on this guy.' He told Cheyenne as he picked up the phone.  Cheyenne looked at the photo of Fredrick Harrelson that his wife had also supplied in the note book. He looked very handsome with chiseled features, slightly graying hair and not one hair out of place; he was fifty years old, married to his wife who was only thirty six years old, His eyes were almost black as coal, she felt like he was watching her through those eyes of the picture. These people remind me of the old horror movies with Bella Lugosi. She thought to herself as a shiver went through her body.  Hank interrupted her thoughts. 'I leave Ft. Lauderdale at seven oâclock in the morning.' Hank told his wife as he came up behind her as she sat working on the case he kissed her lightly on top of her head.  She swirled around in her chair. 'How long do you think you will be gone?' she asked.  'I will try to come back home just as fast as I can.' He knew how much she hated being alone in the house. 'Ralph will be there with you to keep you company.' He told her as he smiled trying to reassure her.  'Now youâre a comedian, Ralph is the only German Shepard who is scared of his own shadow.' She said with a smile thinking of their big bad dog who would give them away to a burglar as long as they did not hurt him or take his food.  'You can come with me.' He said smiling down at her.  'No way am I getting on a plane! Besides I need to do my research here, I just need to figure out how to talk with the Detectives with out giving away our client.' Cheyenne said as she looked at her husband with a puzzled look hoping he would have the answer.  'I am sure you will figure it out baby.' He told her knowing that she could pull it off.  Cheyenne was not surprised that this would be his answer to her. What did she expect he left almost every decision to her to make. She looked at him sarcastically.  ' Thanks for the confidence there slugger.' She said laughingly as she turned her back to him and began reading the papers about the women.  That night at home Cheyenne stepped into the hot shower awaiting her aching body, the hot steamy water felt great on her skin as she soaped up her body into a rich lather and loving the smell of the foamy soap .Cheyenne felt her skin become covered in goose bumps and that same eerie feeling she had earlier today had returned. Hank was busy packing his suit case while she showered and hoping he would not be gone for more then a few days on this trip. He would have to travel to all three states that Fredrick Harrelson had been to in the last six months on his business trips. He loved their small ranch house that he and Cheyenne bought eight months ago, it was quiet and out in Coral Springs. He knew Cheyenne would be alright while he was gone; he just hated having to leave her by herself when he had to travel out of town on cases. He ignored Ralphâs growling at the window as he laid at the foot of their bed.  Hank looked around their bedroom that Cheyenne had decorated, building the entertainment system and dressers into the walls gave them more space. Hank looked around the room feeling a strangeness he had never felt before, as if eyes were upon him, Hank shook it off that Cheyenne's wild imagination was rubbing off on him. He looked out the French colonial windows with black shears; he bumped into the small round table draped in a pink table cover holding a black and pink vase with pink carnations. He stepped backwards thinking he had seen someone in the shadows outside, he stepped out onto the patio to see if his eyes were playing tricks on him.  Cheyenne stepped out of the glass encased shower, sitting next to it was a deep round Jacuzzi tub with candles sitting on the step leading into it. She had designed the tub & sinks in pink pearl with gold faucets, the bath room gave her many a relaxing night where she could unwind. She wrapped the large white towel around her body, wrapping her hair up in a smaller white towel, she sat at her make up table in the corner of the bathroom as she applied make up to her face, she blow dried her hair then splashed perfume lightly over her body, she slipped into her black satin night gown with black lace across her breast and lace straps across her shoulders. She slipped into black spiked heels entering the bedroom, but she found Hank sitting on the patio leading out of the bedroom.   There was a patio table with chairs, in the mornings they drank coffee there. Cheyenne turned on the stereo playing the song look at little sister, swaying her body to the music in front of Hank rubbing her hands over her body, she straddled both of his legs moving her body seductively over him, he took her in his arms kissing her passionately.  'I want you right here and right now.' He told her caressing her breast.   'Mmmm take me now.' She whispered as his fingers found the wetness between her thighs.   'Ahhhh yes' she said as he unfastened his pants going deep inside of her body. She moved her body to the beat of the music playing on the stereo, her movements were causing his thirst for her to grow hotter and wilder as he grabbed the back of her hair and rammed himself deep and hard inside of her sticky sweet juices until they both exploded into a powerful orgasm. 'God the star spangled banner baby!' she laughed as she laid her head on his chest.  'Wow star spangled banner huh?' he laughed as he took a deep breath.' Sure you donât want to make fire works in Colorado?'  She smiled looking into his eyes.' No.' she said smacking his cheek softly.  That night they slept in each otherâs arms until the clock woke them at five oâclock in the morning. Hank did not want to be late for his flight. The hardest thing she had to do was to leave him at the air port; on the way home she played the song Baby I want you by Bread. It was a lonely ride home for her. She entered the house greeted by Ralph barking at her.' You are supposed to greet me with licks and a wagging tail dummy, not bark at Me.,' she said as she patted the dogs head. The living room she decorated with a country style. Pictures of horses running hung on the brown wooden walls. The fireplace had a large rug in front of it on the wooden floor. She hurried into the bedroom to dress to go to the police department to see what she could learn. She wore a pair of blue jeans with a black T-shirt, a blue denim jacket with brown boots. She wore her blonde hair worn down and parted in the middle. Her make up was applied in light brown shades, she lightly applied blush to make her cheek bones stand out.  She drove to the police station to speak with the detectives in charge of the case; she waited in the lobby for the detective to meet her. She felt a strange sensation in her stomach when she saw her ex boyfriend of three yearsâ¦ Roger Oâberst, he was the man Cheyenne had loved for three years and he was the man who broke her heart just before meeting Hank.   He walked up to her smiling and she could feel the heat rising in her face seeing him for the first time since their break up. She noticed he had not changed much since they were last together, his temples had started to gray ever so slightly but he still had dark brown hair, his brown eyes were almost hypnotizing and penetrating when he looked into her eyes. He was tall with a thin build, but muscular in stature. Great, this is not what I needed! Running into Roger today! she thought to herself as he stood smiling down at her.  'Cheyenne why are you here?' he asked taking her hand into his.  'I am waiting to speak to someone in charge of the case of the missing women from the parking lot that is all.' She told him feeling very nervous around him. She looked anxiously at her watch.  He smiled 'Well would you want to talk over coffee?' he said with a smug smile. His charm could be very disarming to someone who did not know him.  Looking at him wide eyed trying to keep her cool with out blowing any chance of getting what she needed to help their case. ****! Now what am I suppose to do? She thought to herself.' Coffee sounds great Roger.' Her smile was so friendly, but inside she felt like daggers were waiting to shoot through her body and straight into his ass. She giggled to herself thinking how funny that would look.  'Good weâll go in my car to the doughnut shop on Atlantic boulevard then.' He said guiding her out side to the back parking lot where his white crown Victoria was parked.  'I can just follow you in my car Roger.' She told him as he unlocked her door.  'Nonsense Cheyenne, itâs been along time since I have had the pleasure of your company.' He smiled as he shut the car door for her.  God he really adds extra charm when he is up to something. She thought to herself as she watched him get in the car.  'How is married life Cheyenne?' He asked putting his arm on the back of the seat as he backed out of the parking space.  She looked out the car window.' Good Roger.' She did not want to talk about her life with him.  'Could have been us you know Cheyenne.' He looked at her as they sat at the red light.  Cheyenne began to laugh, 'Oh please Roger! The only commitment you wanted was the commitment of sex and nothing more! If you could have had a harem you might have been happy for awhile.' She sat shaking her head as she smiled out the car window.  'Sounds like you are still jealous babe.' He smiled as he knew how to push her buttons.  'Oh Roger please! Donât sound so foolish ok?' She said smugly crossing her arms as she remained staring out the window. Us and how many others would their have been too? She asked herself as they pulled into the parking lot of the doughnut shop.  Cheyenne could not wait to get back to her car and away from him, she just needed to see what he would tell her if anything.  They sat across the table from each other sipping the hot coffee it actually helped to ease her tension.  'What is your interest in this case Cheyenne?' he asked looking deep into her eyes.  'Well we have a client who hired us to find out what her husband is doing when he is away on trips.' She was trying not to give to much information for now.  'What does that have to do with the case? Because he goes on trips and this makes his wife suspicious?' He asked knowing there was more to this.  'Because he seems to have left the same day of each disappearance, and she wants to know if he has something to do with these women.' She told him and not wanting to have to go through with this with him, why couldnât it have been anyone else but him?  'What ties does he have with any of these women?' he asked her as he sat back in his chair.  'I donât know, I just started looking into it.' She told him now sounding stupid.  He smiled sipping his coffee.' You should investigate him not my case, when you know there is a connection come talk to me. ' He said as he looked very serious at her with out a trace of a smile.' But, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me what you know if you want me to talk about the case.' He smiled at her so smugly.  She sat back in her chair studying his face 'There isnât any use in me sitting here any longer, I can see this is not going anywhere.' She told him feeling like crying from the aggravation when she realized she had to wait for him. Great! Just what I wanted to be stuck here with him with out any type of escape in sight! She thought as she sat back down. She sat silently then pulled herself together.' Your right I should have seen if he was connected to them first, but I thought by seeing what connections the police may have found it might have linked back to him .' She said humbly hoping it worked and he would talk to her.  'What is his name?' he asked as he ran his finger around the rim of his coffee.  'I am not ready to tell you since it may be nothing.' she explained to him.  'But you want me to talk and tell you what we have?' he asked irritated.  'I am sorry, but if you go to him he will know someone pointed a finger at him and heâll suspect it was his wife.' she tried to explain to him why she did not want to tell him too much.  Roger sat for a moment as he realized he could have her work with him on this , it would mean being together until he got what he wanted, her.   'I have an offer since we both know each other and we both want to find out what is going on and who the responsible party is, you will have to work with me though .' he told her as he watched her reaction to his proposal.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Cheyenne looked at her shaking hands in her lap 'Alright you have a deal.' She told him not looking at him. She would work with him until she had her answer, besides Hank will be home soon, she thought to herself, it will be ok. She tried hard to reassure herself.    That night as Ralph and Cheyenne sat on the front porch they watched the car lights that came up the drive way, Ralph wagged his tail as Roger walked up to the porch, Cheyenne looked at Ralph. 'You are a dumb dog.' Cheyenne said standing up to greet him as he came up the steps.  ' Hi Roger, would you like some coffee?' she asked trying very hard to be polite to him and fighting the pain of the old wounds that had not healed from their relationship.  He smiled at Cheyenne and patted Ralph on the head.  ' Thank you that sounds good.' He said thinking to him self how she still looked great even in an over sized gray sweat shirt and jeans without shoes just socks.' I feel over dressed now that I see how comfortable you look.' He said following her into the house.  'Iâll fix the coffee, Sit down at the dinning room table that will probably be best for us to use.' She said as she pointed at the rustic table with a white table cloth, the chairs were wooded high backs with white cushions that tied to the back of the chair.  As they sat for an hour going over each others notes Cheyenne looked at the window as she saw lightening streak through the sky.' Looks as if a storm is brewing out there.' She said as she placed her chin on her fist as she read the papers. 'These women just vanished? God what is he doing with them?' she looked at Roger knowing in her heart they had to be dead.  'All we know is he strikes every three weeks and this is the third week.' He said sipping his coffee.  Cheyenne read the notes and quickly went to the kitchen grabbing her calendar looking at each month and date the women disappeared.' They all disappeared on the third Thursday and tomorrow is Thursday Roger.' Her eyes were showing panic as she realized tomorrow another woman would disappear.  'We know, we have set up more security around the shopping centers and parking areas.' he said as he swallowed the cookie he was eating.  The phone rang Cheyenne knew it would be Hank calling in since in another hour he would have to call Mrs. Harrelson. Cheyenne picked Up the phone smiling.  'Hello baby!' her voice was so cheerful even though she missed him so much. 'Have you heard anything?' she asked him as she played with the hem of her sweat shirt.  Roger tried to concentrate on the papers in front of him but he couldnât, it still hurt to hear her saying I love you and I miss you to someone else. He clinched his fist for he knew he was the one who screwed up the relationship not her. Damn if she only knew how sorry I was. He thought to himself. He heard his name mentioned in their conversation looking up at Cheyenne.  'He is only here so we can work on this case with out me having to reveal our client at this time.' Her voice was agitated as she spoke to Hank. 'Well youâre going to have to trust me, even if you donât trust him Hank.' Cheyenne looked at the floor as she played with the phone cord.' I love you too baby, good night & sweet dreams.'   Those words tore through Rogers heart, he looked away to hide the tears. 'I need to use your rest room.' He said as he quickly got up from the table.  'Itâs down the hall way to your right.' Cheyenne pointed in the direction of the rest room she sensed a change in his attitude.  Cheyenne watched the lightening dance across the sky from the window she noticed the wind was blowing stronger; the lights started flickering in the house great we are going to lose the electric she thought. Ralph sat next to Cheyenne.' Its ok boy.' She said patting him.   Roger came down the hall way the lights went out.' Hope you have candles or a flash light.' He said as he made his way back to the table.  'Both as luck would have it.' She told him as she felt her way into the kitchen.  She lit the candlewick watching the trees bending in the wind, damn this is a bad storm hitting us, she thought as she grabbed the portable radio. She walked back out to Roger sitting at the table. 'Ah light.' He said with a smile.  'This storm is bad Roger I think we should listen to the radio. 'She said as she sat back down at the table.  'At least weâre inside instead of being caught outside in it.' He said as the thunder began to shake the windows.  They looked at the radio as the DJ came on with a storm warning.  ' We are asking everyone to seek cover we are in a severe thunder storm with sightings of three tornados, itâs expected to last until three am.' The DJ reported over the radio.  Roger and Cheyenne looked at each other knowing they would be spending the duration of the night together in the same house.  'You can sleep in the guest room tonight.' She said feeling strange knowing he would be under the same roof with her.  'Thank you, but if it will be a problem I can try to make it home.' He told her knowing she would not send him out into the storm.  'Donât be silly, weâre two adults and should be able to stay under the same roof.' She told him as the strange feeling grew stronger with each word. 'I hope Hank tells me that Mr. Harrelson went on his trips on different days then when the women disappeared.' She said trying to change the subject.  'Has he found out anything from the trip?' Roger asked as he watched Cheyenne in the candle light, she looks so angelic, he thought to himself.  'Yes on each trip Mr. Harrelson was accompanied by a woman, but the clerk couldnât be sure if it was any of the women in the news paper clippings that Hank showed him.' She told him.  He smiled to him self. 'When he calls back tell him I will fax over a better photo of the victims.' He told her knowing this would be a stall tactic to keep Hank away for a little longer.  'Alright I will tell him when he calls back.' She told him knowing that Hank would be calling her back since he knew Roger was there with her. 'What about tomorrow? He is going to strike again you know.' She told him looking scared.  'Weâve done all we can do Cheyenne, increasing security is the best we could do, besides hoping and praying that your guy will be ID so we can nail him before he strikes again.' He told her, he felt helpless in preventing the abduction from taking place.  Roger watched Cheyenne twirling her hair in her fingers as she sat at the table with her feet up in the chair and one arm wrapped around her legs watching the lightening light up the sky, the song came on she will leave you smiling by George Straight. She sure will, he thought as he watched her as they sat in silence.  Hank finally called back with out any new information from Mrs. Harrelson, she couldnât be sure if it was Thursday when Mr. Harrelson went on his trips, she just knew it was around the same time of the month. This made sense to Roger since he could have abducted them and left the next day.  'Cheyenne this could have been our house if you hadnât left me.' He said taking a deep breath.  Cheyenne laughed.' Oh please! You were to busy being the big player then being into a commitment! I was not the only woman in our relationship and you didnât even try to hide them! That is how arrogant you are! 'She said trying not to lose her cool completely with him.  'You must still have feelings for me Cheyenne, because youâre still so angry at me.' He said smugly.  'No woman likes to be made a fool of and treated like yesterdays left over.' She said sitting straight up with her feet now on the floor.  'You were always first with me; I never took the other ones around my friends.' He told her sounding so serious.  Cheyenne looked at him with a look of pity.' You really believe that bull**** your running through your head donât you?' she asked him as she could almost see a child like quality inside of him.' I am going to go to bed now. ' She said as she turned to go to her room.  The storm was getting worse as Cheyenne laid in her bed watching how it lit up the entire room with its brilliant flashes until she fell into a deep sleep.  Roger tossed and turned all night knowing that she was in the same house, and not in his arms. If I could only do it all over again I would still have her. He thought to him self. Roger drifted off to sleep when Ralph jumped up on the bed next to him. Roger looked at the dog.  ' Donât hog the covers, and no snoring or youâre gone.' He said putting his arm around Ralph.  Hank lay in his hotel room bed with thoughts of Cheyenne and the love they have together. He wondered how she was sleeping alone without him beside her, or was Roger sleeping in their bed with her. He looked at the clock it was two oâclock in the morning, he smashed the bottle of beer next to his bed and rolled over.   Cheyenne was awakened the next morning by Ralphâs barking outside the house, she sleepily got out of bed to look out the window to see what the commotion was all about. Looking out the window she saw Ralph barking at Roger as he chopped up the fallen tree from the night before. 'How nice of him, but it wonât work Roger.' She said to herself as she watched him stack the tree up neatly by the road for the sanitation department to remove it.  She decided to jump in the shower while he was busy outside. She stepped into the hot shower water; it felt so refreshing to her. she hated it when she had to step out of the shower, she put on her long white terry cloth robe, wrapped her hair in a white towel, she walked to her closet where she picked out a long blue jean skirt that rested on her hips, with a wide black suede belt with long fringe hanging from each end, a purple and black peasant shirt that hung off her shoulders slightly with suede black boots that were just below her knee. She wore her blond hair down with just the sides pulled up. She looked at herself in the mirror pleased with her outfit. 'Not bad for a forty five year old woman.' She said going to the kitchen where she found fresh made coffee, and a piece of breakfast cake waiting for her at the table with a white rose and note which had written, I am sorry for last night Cheyenne. A smile actually came to her face as she softly touched the flower with her finger tips.  Cheyenne began her morning with a cup of coffee, she smiled with a slight chuckle' Youâre only sorry Roger because you didnât get me in the bed with you .' She said as she sat at the kitchen table when she heard the front door shut knowing it must be Ralph and Roger coming in.  ' Good morning Cheyenne.' Roger said as he and Ralph came into the kitchen. 'We are going to have to go by my place so I can shower and change.' He told her as he sat at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee.  'I will just meet you at the station Roger.' She said as she sipped her coffee.  'That is impossible since your car also had a tree sitting on it.' He told her pouring some more coffee into his cup.  'No, not my car, youâre kidding right?' She asked as she searched his face for some kind of a sign saying it was all a joke.  'Your car Cheyenne, so you better call your insurance company.' He told her sipping on his coffee.  Cheyenne got up from the table 'Damn it!' she said as she ran out of the house to check on her car. She could not believe it when she saw it the tree was sitting on top of her car just as he said it was.  'Why didnât we get two cars when we were going to?' She said looking at the car.   'We need to get going Cheyenne if we are going to try and stop this guy today.' Roger told her.  'Ok letâs go.' She said as they walked to his car.  They pulled in front of his house, she noticed nothing had changed; it still looked the same as when she was last there. The little boy statue still stood in the front yard with the lantern; she always thought it was precious. He still had the brown leather sofa and matching love seat, the glass coffee table with matching end tables, the large black television that took up a whole wall it self. On the wall still hung the plaque with the love poem she had given him on the last Valentines Day they were together.   'You know where everything is Cheyenne make your self at home while I get ready.' He told her as he walked down the hall way to his room.  Cheyenne picked up a sportsman magazine and read it as Roger showered.  Roger appeared in the living room. Cheyenne noticed he was wearing blue jeans, a burgundy pull over shirt, with white sneakers. Cheyenne smiled at him. 'You are dressed casual?' she asked as they were leaving the house.  'I recall the last time we were together I ended up ruining an expensive suit.' He told her as he locked the front door.  Once inside the car Cheyenne looked seriously at Roger. 'It is not my fault that you decided to take a balloon filled with food coloring that was intended for me.' She told him turning her head to look out the window smiling as she recalled the incident.  'Well next time someone points an object that resembles a gun at you remind me not to protect you.' he told her feeling agitated with her.  She tried to hold in her laughter.' You are such a male chauvinist pig! I am quite capable of taking care of myself buddy.' She said wanting to burst out in laughter.  'As long as your sister does not have some guy out to with balloons to hit you with.' He told her as he backed up the car.  'It was a joke and she didnât know we were going to a charity ball either.' She said looking at him as he drove down the road.  Most of the ride to the police station was in silence, Cheyenne could not resist to pick on him more.' You were really pist off.' She said as she looked out the window.   'Your getting quite a kick out of this memory lane youâre having arenât you Cheyenne?' he asked her finally smiling.  'Yes I am as a matter of fact, because your expression was priceless.' She said tauntingly.  'Glad I could be of service in making you laugh Cheyenne.' He said as he pulled into the parking space.  Once inside of his office Roger faxed over the photos he had for Hank. Cheyenne sat quietly looking out the office window over looking the front of the station with the marble pond where people were sitting on the edge talking or smoking cigarettes. Cheyenne looked around his office so immaculate, even his black desk had every piece of paper in order; she looked at the picture of his daughter sitting in front of the chair so he could see her as he sat at the desk. She died so young, just 17, first day driving and out of nowhere a drunk driver struck the car killing his daughter instantly. What a shame Cheyenne thought to herself.  'Ready to go see Mrs. Harrelson?' he asked as he picked up some more files.  'Yes I am ready.' Cheyenne said as she walked out of the office.  They both were quiet as they drove to the Harrelsonâs house; Cheyenne prayed they would find a connection to stop one more woman from being abducted today.   Roger looked at Cheyenne as they pulled in front of the house.' Well letâs see what we learn here today.' He said as he almost felt helpless to catching whoever was behind these abductions.  Cheyenne felt nervous it was the same feeling she had the last time she was here, as if there were eyes watching them. She noticed that Roger had his hand on his gun in its holster. Probably just habit, she thought to herself.  The door opened with the little old woman standing there looking surprised to see them there.' Mrs. Harrelson is not expecting any guest today.' She said in her soft voice.  'We know she isnât, I am Detective Oâberst and I wish to speak with her now.' His voice was cool as he looked into the womanâs eyes.  'Come in detective and Mrs. Thompson I will tell Mrs. Harrelson you are here.' Her voice sounded irritated.  'I think we hit a nerve with her.' Roger said as he watched the woman go into the den.  A few moments later she came back to where they were standing.' She will receive you now.' She told them leading them to the den.  Sheâs a female Lurch. Cheyenne thought as they walked down the hall. Once inside Mrs. Harrelson sat behind the desk wearing a green satin robe with a matching gown. Green must be her favorite color, Cheyenne thought to herself remembering she had on an emerald green dress on the last time she and Hank were there.  'How can I help you two today?' She asked in weakened voice.' You will have to excuse me I am not well.' She said rubbing her fore head with her finger tips.  'We need to ask some questionâs about your husband.' Roger told her sitting in one of the chairs in front of the desk. 'Besides the fact that your husband seems to be gone on the same day as the women have been abducted what makes you think he is involved?' Roger noticed her hands shaking as she lit up a cigarette.  'Because when I started to suspect him I would think a woman would show up missing on the day he left and they did. I can not say I have seen him do it with my own eyes because I havenât detective, but I know he is flying out to Dallas today at six pm and I know in my heart a woman will come up missing.' Her eyes had tears in them as she spoke.  'What plane will he be taking?' Roger asked as he couldnât help notice how beautiful she looked.  'I donât know he never tells me, I over heard him making his reservations for today.' She told him as she forced a smile.  'May I see his comb or brush something that would have his prints on it?' he asked her smiling. 'I need to see if his finger print matches with what we have.' He said looking at this gorgeous creature sitting in front of him.  Cheyenne seeing him putting on his charm accidentally kicked him in the shin. 'I am so sorry Roger.' She said smiling secretly to her self.  Roger rubbed his leg. 'No harm done Cheyenne.' He told her looking at her strangely.  Mrs. Harrelson called for her house keeper on the intercom.  ' Aggatha please bring me Mr. Harrelsonâs brush & comb set without touching it, use something not to remove any prints.' She smiled trying to conceal her pain. 'I hope this puts the end to the abductions, plus the end to the nagging question going through my head.' She told them rubbing her brow with her finger tips.  When the woman came in with the brush and comb she handed them to Roger using prongs and placing them in a bag.' Your sure no one but him has touched these?' he asked the elderly woman.  'No one except for Mr. Harrelson uses this set detective.' She told him then stepped away from him.  Roger placed the bag he had in his pocket. 'I will be in contact with you as soon as we know the results.' He told the woman as he stood up to leave.  'Thank you detective.' Mrs. Harrelson told him as they were leaving.  Roger rushed back to the station to have the hair samples tested. 'If we get a match then all we have to do is meet him before the plane leaves at six tonight.' he told Cheyenne who closed her eyes most of the ride.  Once inside the station he had Cheyenne to wait in his office while he went to have the prints ran, normally it could take up to eight hours but he placed a rush on it. She wished Hank would return soon she hated it when they were apart. She waited what seemed to be an hour before he returned. 'We got a match. Thereâs been an APB issued for him, itâs just a matter of time now.' He told her in an ecstatic voice.  'I hope they pick him up before he gets another woman.' She said looking at her watch.' In four hours he is suppose to be leaving.'   'You know one thing I was relieved about through all of this? Is that you are a blonde and not a brunette.' He said sitting on the corner of the desk top.  She flashed him an ear to ear grin.' Yes I am very grateful to Miss. Clairol in a bottle.' She told him with a smile so bright it made her look younger then forty five years old. 'Well I guess all we can do now is just pray and hope he gets picked up.' She told him looking so lost and sad like a small child.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Roger looked at her wanting to protect her. 'I will take you home and then I will go wait at the air port for him to show up.' He said standing up when the phone rang. ' Hello Hank.' Roger said into the receiver.  Cheyenne looked up as he spoke with her husband on the phone.  'We got a match on his prints today; heâs supposed to be flying out to Dallas at six this evening and we will be waiting for him there. No, yes I will be taking her home. Ok I will tell her.' He said and hung up the phone.  'Tell me what?' she asked him trying to hide that she was upset that he didnât ask to speak to her, Hank knew she was there.  'He said he loved you and he will call you when he arrives in Dallas.' He told her seeing it upset her that Hank did not speak to her himself.  'Ok, well I am ready to go home.' she said forcing a smile as she stood up. 'Why is he going to Dallas? She asked.   'We better go.' Roger said trying to avoiding the question.  Cheyenne looked at Roger knowing he was keeping something from her, something that Hank told him on the phone. What? What are they keeping from me? She asked herself.    During the ride to the house Cheyenne was quiet as it kept bothering her he did not talk to her on the phone.' Roger can you tell me why Hank would not want to talk to me on the phone?' she trusted him enough to at least tell her the truth since even in their relationship he never lied, not even about the other women.  'He said his plane was departing and he would call you when he got there.' He told her as he could see it was an issue that really bothered her.' Donât worry Cheyenne, he is not me and would not cheat on you. I give him better brain cells then I have.' He was trying to cheer her up.  She looked at him with a smile.' Your right Roger, he does have more brain cells then you.' Her smile grew across her face.  'Wow that hurt. You can be so cruel Cheyenne.' He said holding his heart as if in pain.  As they drove up to the gate to the drive way Cheyenne noticed an old gray car.' Wonder who that could be?' looking at the strange car parked in there.  'It looks like your best friend has come back to town to see you.' Roger said pointing to Kimberly and her mother Norma sitting on the front porch.  'Son-of-a-bitch.' Cheyenne said looking at the two women, they looked like they had been on the road for awhile.' Wonder what they want this time?' her voice was irritated seeing them in front of her home.  Roger chuckled. 'Money, a place to stay, you know the same old thing as before.' Roger told her as he pulled up beside their car.  The two women quickly got to their feet when they saw Cheyenne and Roger. 'Hi there!' they both yelled at the same time as they waved at them.  Kimberly was the first to greet Cheyenne.' How have you been? I have really missed you!' she said hugging Cheyenne when she came out of the car.  'Iâll bet, what brings you two here?' she asked looking at Norma who was thin and bruised. 'What happened to you?' She asked the woman seeing she had been beaten.  'Oh itâs nothing Cheyenne; I just made someone mad at me.' She said glancing nervously in Kimberlyâs direction as she wrung her hands together.  'Cheyenne I am pregnant without anywhere to stay. The dumb bitch lost our home we had.' Kimberly told her angrily.' Could we stay here until we find work?'  'I have to ask Hank Kimberly, Heâs out of town right now.'  'So why are you with Roger?' Kimberly asked smiling as if there was something going on between them.  'Weâre working on a case together, I need to get going Cheyenne I will call you tonight.' Roger said as he got back in his car.  'Nice to see you too Roger.' Kimberly said watching him leave.  'Well letâs go inside.' Cheyenne said as she led the way.  'Oh Cheyenne this place is so nice.' Norma said as she looked around the place.   'Want some coffee?' Cheyenne asked the two women standing in her living room.  'Yes thank you Cheyenne.' they said as they followed her into the kitchen.  'Cheyenne it will only be for three weeks I promise.' Kimberly told her as she was almost in tears.  'Iâll be talking to Hank soon.' She told her as she put the coffee on.  ' You two can go shower it will make you feel better.' she said looking at the womenâs dirty feet on her clean floor. 'Please wear socks when your inside.' she said as she showed them the shower in the hall way near the guest room theyâd be sharing.   As Cheyenne was making some ham and cheese sandwiches to eat with some vegetable soup she heard the two women yelling at each other.' Better go check it out Ralph.' She said patting the dogs head.  'I am not sharing this room with you, you dumb bitch! I hate you! God I wish you had died instead of dad!' Kimberly was screaming at Norma hysterically.  'What is going on in here?' Cheyenne asked as she swung open the door.  'I do not want to sleep in the same room as her Cheyenne, I hate her!' she told her and began to cry.  'Stop acting like this Kimberly, she either stays in here or neither one of you will stay here at all.' Cheyenne told them both.' Now letâs go eat.'  'I donât want to eat.' Kimberly said with quivering lips.  'Youâre pregnant and need some good food now come on.' She told them.  When they sat down to eat Kimberly looked up at Cheyenne.' I donât like vegetable beef soup.' She said holding her hand over her bowl.  Cheyenne smiled at her.' Move your hand or I will pour the soup on it, the baby needs vegetables.' Cheyenne told her as she held the soup ladle over her hand.  'Fine Iâll eat it.' She said moving her hand.  As they sat at the table Cheyenne looked at Kimberly who was heavy and you really couldnât see her pregnancy.' How many months are you?' she asked looking at her belly.  'Six months.' she said.  'Where is the father?' Cheyenne asked biting into her sandwich.  'He dumped me when he found out I was pregnant.' She said as tears filled her eyes.  'I am sorry Kimberly, but you will be fine. 'She said patting her hand on the table top.  Just then the phone rang it was Roger letting her know that Harrelson never showed up to catch the plane. Roger was having his men wait there in case he caught a later plane out that night and he was going to go back to the Harrelsonâs house to see if by any chance he was there. After they hung up the phones she felt that same feeling like they were being watched a chill ran down her spine as she looked out the kitchen window.  'I think I will take a shower right now, if Hank calls bring the phone to me in the rest room Kimberly.' She said as she looked at the woman sitting in front of her with stringy black hair, she had dark circles around her black eyes, her self esteem was very low about her self.' Hey what if I trim up your hair when I am done?' Cheyenne knew it must be very scary to bring a child into the world but even more so without the father being with you.  Kimberly smiled' Thanks Cheyenne, I could use a hair cut.' She said running her swollen fingers through her hair.  'Hey would you mind cutting mine too Cheyenne?' Norma asked fingering her mousy brown thin hair.  'The beauty shop will open when I come out of the shower ladies.' Cheyenne said as she walked towards her bed room.  In the shower it felt great to feel the hot steamy water on her flesh, as she was shampooing her hair she thought she heard a thud on the bathroom floor.' Anyone there?' she asked but she didnât get a response from anyone. It wasnât until she had rinsed her hair that someone banged on the bathroom window. Cheyenne turned the water off quickly, grabbing her robe from the hook in the rest room she yelled  ' whoâs out there?' again no response as she looked down at her feet was a large rat with its head decapitated and it blood running onto the floor. Cheyenne reeled backwards screaming then ran out of the bathroom into her bedroom just as the phone began to rang, the other women came running into her room.  'Whatâs wrong Cheyenne?' they asked together.  'Who put a fucking headless rat in my bathroom?' She screamed at the women.  'What are you talking about?' Kimberly asked and then went to look.  Cheyenne answered the phone 'Hello?' It was Hank; he had made it to Dallas. Cheyenne was hysterical as she told him about the rat and the banging on the window. She hung up the phone.' He said to lock all the windows and doors, Kimberly call the police.' Cheyenne noticed her doors to the patio was slightly opened she ran to lock them.  Cheyenne put on a light blue shirt dress that fit tight against her body, with light blue sandals as she waited for the police to arrive.  Cheyenne joined the other women in the living room.  ' Who could have put that rat in there?' She asked the other women.  The women shook their heads not having a clue as who could be so sick to do such a thing. There was a knock at the door.' Please be the police.' Kimberly said looking fearful at the door.  Cheyenne opened the door slowly seeing two uniformed officers standing there.' Hello, thank you for coming so fast.' She said opening the door up wider to let them in.  Cheyenne showed them the bathroom with the dead rat. 'I was taking a shower when I heard a thud, after I was done and just getting out someone banged on my bathroom window. I found my patio doors a jarred.' she said pointing to the doors in her bedroom.  Roger appeared in the doorway of the bedroom. 'Cheyenne Hank asked me to come by to see what was going on here.' He told her as he looked at the rat that the policeman had in a bag.  'I thought you were going to the Harrelsonâs? How did Hank get a hold of you?' Cheyenne questioned him.  'He had the station to call me.' He told her as he walked to the bathroom to look around he could still smell the shampoo and soap Cheyenne had used.  'Why would Hank ask you to come here to check on me?' she asked as this confused her that her husband would have her ex lover to come to her rescue.  'At each crime scene Cheyenne there had been a headless rat. I think heâs left a calling card here to let us know that he knows weâre onto him.' He told her looking at her in her dress.  Cheyenne crossed her arms across her chest realizing she had not put on a bra.' I am blonde! My hair is not brunette! I am a fucking blonde!' she told him as tears came to her eyes realizing this guy was just here inside of her home! He watched her take a shower!  'Thatâs why your still here Cheyenne.' He told her seeing how afraid she was.' I will stay here with you women tonight; Hank will be back tomorrow morning.' he told her hoping it would ease the tension she was feeling.  The phone rang Roger answered it.' Hello.' He said as he looked at the three women standing together.' Hank what the hell do you mean he is at the hotel? How long has he been there? Damn it how did he get through us? Is there anyone else with him? Youâre in the room next to his? Good keep an eye on him if you can. Alright talk to you tomorrow. I will put her on the phone.' Roger handed the phone to Cheyenne.  'Hello? Hank how could he be there and been here too? Ok baby I will. I love you and miss you.' She hung up the phone. She looked at Roger. 'What the hell is going on here? How could he be there? Hank said they both were checking in at the hotel.' She looked so confused.  'He may not work alone Cheyenne.' Roger said as he let the crime scene unit in to do their work.' You ladies go sit in the kitchen while we try to get prints.' Roger told them and went outside to see if he could find any tracks. He wondered how the person or persons had gotten past Ralph who was next to Cheyenne in the kitchen.  As Roger came up to the patio off of Cheyenneâs room he saw a dog food can with half a can of food still in it. Roger knew then Ralph had been fed to be distracted. Using his pen he brought the can into the room to be checked for prints and toxins. It would not surprise him if the perpetrator or perpetrator's poisoned the dog to get him permanently out of the way. Roger and the other officer checked the outside premises and would resume in the morning when they had better lighting. Roger stood on the patio looking into the night and felt as if someone was watching him.    That evening as they all sat around the living room Cheyenne sat close to Roger, he knew she was scared. 'I donât want Cheyenne alone in her room tonight so one of you ladies will be her room mate.' He told them.  Cheyenne sat straight up on the couch. 'Like hell! I am sleeping right out here with you detective.' She told him looking like a scared child afraid of the boogie man. 'I will put pallets on the floor next to the couch where you will be sleeping.' She said then got up to make her bed. 'Come with me Norma.' She said looking scared into her dark bedroom.  'Hey I think we all should sleep in the same room tonight.' Norma said to Cheyenne and Roger.  'That might be a good idea Norma.' Cheyenne said as they went to gather up blankets and the air bed to lie on.  Cheyenne changed into a pair of gray sweat pants and a loose fitting black t shirt. She lay on the side of the couch near Roger who slept in his slacks without a shirt. Norma slept between Cheyenne and Kimberly. After Cheyenne had fallen to sleep Roger laid his hand on her shoulder watching her face as he fell into a deep sleep. A few hours had passed as they slept when Roger felt Cheyenneâs soft lips kissing his lipâs she was laying on top of him on the couch. 'I want you.' she whispered into his ear. His hands were moving up and down her body slowly as she licked his neck slowly. He began to kiss her passionately holding the back of her head with his hand when he was jolted upright by Cheyenneâs blood curdling scream from the air bed. 'Cheyenne whatâs wrong?' he asked moving down to the air bed and taking her into his arms as he realized he had been dreaming.  'I thought I saw the rat in the bed with me!' she cried as she realized it was a nightmare.  'God you scared me! I guess I look like a rat in the dark.' Norma said trying to make Cheyenne laugh.  'I have to go piss now.' Kimberly said getting up to go to the rest room. 'I think you scared it out of me.' She said staggering to the rest room.  'Your ok Cheyenne nothing is going to harm you.' Roger said holding her close to him as he could feel her heart beating fast and hard against his own chest.  'I am sorry I hate rats.' She said as she pulled away from Roger slowly. ' Headless ones especially.' She shuddered as Roger sat back on the couch; she began to laugh realizing she must have scared everyone in the room, even Ralph sat at the foot of the bed looking around the room.  'Well letâs try to get back to sleep then.' Kimberly said as she came back to bed.  What a great dream I was having too. Roger thought to himself as he lay back on the couch looking down at Cheyenne lying next to him on the air bed.  At four in the morning the phone rang, Cheyenne hurried to her feet to answer it, her heart pounding thinking the worse when the phone rings in the middle of the night. 'Hello?' Cheyenne switched to the speaker phone so Roger could hear the person on the other end.  'Cheyenne I wanted to tell you that tonight when you were in the shower, I stood next to the shower door watching you wash those nice rounded breast that are shaped like melons. You really turned me on, I have been thinking of how I am going to fuck you up that plump round ass you have.' He told her as his breathing was becoming heavier as he spoke to her.' I am going to force you on your knees and ram my thick hard shaft deep into you Cheyenne!' his breathing was getting heavier as he spoke.' going in your ass deeper, and harder, harder, harder oh Cheyenne!' for a few seconds there was silence.' I will be back to visit when I can enjoy my orgasm with you in person Cheyenne.' The speaker phone went dead.  Cheyenne looked at Roger.' it was him! He is coming back for me!' she said panicked thinking of how close he was to her tonight in the shower that he could have made his phone sex a reality. Chills ran through her body.  Roger got on the phone to call Hank.  ' Is that bastard still in his room? He just called here getting off on the phone making Cheyenne listen to his sex fantasy about her .Go check, I donât know! Act like youâre a drunk trying to get into the wrong room. I will wait.' He told him wanting this bastard more then ever after hearing what he wanted to do to her.  A few minutes past when Hank came back telling him he was there with company, a petite brunette who was not there against her will either since she opened the door in just a sheet.  The next morning Roger received a letter special delivered by an officer from his precinct. With a Polaroid picture of a woman tied down while a person covered in a hooded robe pour ratâs blood all over her body. He could see the woman screaming in the picture, the letter wrote with cut out letters from a news paper saying it will be worse for his girlfriend Cheyenne.  'Anything good?' she asked him as she handed him the hot cup.  'You could say that.' He said smiling as he didnât want her to catch on to what he had received from the sick bastard.   As Cheyenne showered he called one of the other detectives to track down the letter and where it originated from.  Cheyenne hurriedly showered as memories of last night flooded her mind, it was the first time she had ever felt scared of being in her home. Pull it together Cheyenne or you will become a victim instead of catching the jerk. She thought to her self as she rinsed the conditioner from her hair. She opened the glass door she looked down at the floor to see if any surprises were there for her. Good nothing there. She thought as she stepped out. She sat on her bed in her white robe with a white towel wrapped around her head, she heard voices in her living room, there was another man there besides Roger and it was not Hank. Who is here? She wondered as she cracked opened her door to see who the other man was. Itâs Detective John Saunders. She thought to herself as she listened to what they were saying.  'The sick son of a bitch is taunting us by zeroing in on Cheyenne as a target.' Roger said to Saunders.  Detective Saunders was a very tall man, blond curly hair, tanned with blue eyes that seemed to always sparkle. He stood with his hands on his hips as he looked at the floor.' The mail came from the sixth victim Gloria Luchese home address; they are still looking into it.' He said as he took a deep breath as he loosened the collar and tie on his white dress shirt, his black slacks looked as though they had just recently been pressed, his black dress shoes as though they were just shined.  'She was the latest victim and the picture was of the first victim. We have got to catch him.' Roger said as he noticed Cheyenneâs door opened. 'Cheyenne?' He walked to the door and opened it slowly when he saw Cheyenne sitting on her bed drying her hair with the towel. He closed the door slowly thinking she had not seen him.  What is going on? She thought as she tried not to breathe hard from racing to the bed so they would not know she was eaves dropping on them. Cheyenne put on a lavender tank top, blue jeans and white sneakers. I think I need to go to these womenâs houses and see if perhaps there is some connection. As the men were talking in the kitchen Cheyenne went to Kimberlyâs room.  ' Come on you have to give me a ride.' She said grabbing her by the arm.  'I am not dressed Cheyenne.' She said still in her night gown.  'Grab a robe we have to go now and be quiet.' She told her in a quiet voice so the men would not hear her.  'Damn it.' She said slipping on her robe as she followed Cheyenne out to the car.' This is crazy Cheyenne where are we going?â she asked as they got into the car.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  Cheyenne remembered Roger saying the mail came from one of the victimâs home address 'Weâre going to go and see what we can find at Gloria Luchese house.' She said as she saw her front door swing open and Roger running out of it.' Hurry up and go!' she said as Kimberly was pulling out. 'I forced you to go so donât worry about getting into trouble ok!' Cheyenne told her with irritation in her voice. 'Just drive there and drive fast before they grab anything like pen pal clubs or something where lonely females join to find men.' She told her.  Kimberly was scared, but did not want to make Cheyenne mad at her; she would be totally alone if Cheyenne turned her back on her with the baby coming. Her family had disowned her and her mother, the woman that she blames for everything ever having gone wrong in her life right down to her causing her boyfriend for just leaving one day while she was at work. She was shaking all over her body as she drove down the long lonely road surrounded by trees on both side. She saw Rogerâs car coming out of the drive way. 'Shit Cheyenne! Roger just pulled out what do I do?' she said looking in the rear view mirror.  'Watch the road would be nice and floor it.' Cheyenne said in a calm even toned voice.  'Which way do I go at the end of the street Cheyenne?' she asked in a nervous voice.  ' Left and then go like your going to Wallyâs house she only lived a few blocks away from him on tenth street.' Cheyenne said as she watched Rogerâs car trying to catch up from the passengerâs side window.  Once Kimberly turned left at the end of the street she quickly turned right and then into a drive way.' I figured we would let him go by so we could get away.' She said looking at Cheyenne with fear in her eyes.  'Smart thinking Kim I will give you a cookie when we get home.' Cheyenne said trying to ease the tension Kimberly was feeling.  Kimberly laughed. 'I saw it on a TV show last week.' She said backing up once she saw Rogerâs car going down the other road.  The two women pulled in front of Gloria Luchese home that she shared with her parents. They were both silent as they looked at the house.  Kimberly looked in the rear view to see if Roger was coming her heart was beating hard in her chest.  'You go; I will wait here for you.' She said not wanting to get out of the car in her robe and gown.  'Bull shit! Come on your not taking off on me now, letâs go!' Cheyenne yelled at her  Cheyenne and Kimberly stood nervously at the front door as they looked around to see if Rodger was coming down the road.' You look cute by the way in your night clothes.' Cheyenne said with a smile.  'Your so funny Cheyenne, I could have sat in the car while you did this.' Kimberly said in an almost whiney voice.  The door was opened by an elderly white hair woman standing there.' May I help you?' she said looking at the two women standing at her door.  'Hello, my name is Cheyenne Thompson I am a private investigator working on your daughterâs case, I was wondering if I could look around her room?' Cheyenne told the woman as she was trying to cover her impatience.  'Nice to meet you Miss. Thompson, please come in and help your self the bedroom is down the hall, last door to the left.' She said pointing to the room as she let the women in the house.  Cheyenne went to the room it was decorated in early American furniture with a canopy bed. A picture of her and her boyfriend, an old fashion phone from the fifties by her bed.  Cheyenne went through the womanâs mail to see if she could find anything when the phone began to ring, the woman had a private line to her room. Cheyenne picked up the phone saying nothing as she heard a manâs voice on the other end.  'Hello Cheyenne, I have been waiting for you.'  Cheyenne looked weird at the phone wondering how they knew it was her. Kimberly saw fear in Cheyenneâs face.  'Who is this?' Cheyenne asked as her hand began to shake.  'You can not escape me Cheyenne, I am going to enjoy fucking you! I am going to add you to my collection.' The voice said taunting Cheyenne.  'Youâll never get to me to fuck me or anything else.' She told the faceless voice.  Cheyenne was feeling fear run through her body. 'This is too freaky Kim.' She said looking at her friend with her hand over the receiver.   'Hang up Cheyenne, letâs go now! Who ever it is knows weâre here!' Kimberly urged Cheyenne wanting to leave.  'I will kill you before you touch me in any way.' Cheyenne yelled.  'Damn it lets go!' Kimberly said almost in tears.  'Tell your friend she will be included too since she is pregnant.' The voice said in an eerie tone.  'Leave her and her unborn child out of this, or Iâll enjoying putting my 357 up your ass and pulling the trigger!' Cheyenne yelled as tears burned her eyes.  'Thatâs it I am out of here! Come on Cheyenne!' Kimberly cried as she pulled on Cheyenneâs arm.  'Cheyenne I ought to arrest you!' Rogerâs voice boomed behind the two women who jumped from being startled by him. Cheyenne dropped the phone.  Roger picked up the phone receiver.   ' What the hell?' he asked hearing the man on the other end of the phone.  'You are losing your hot little girlfriend detective.' The voice said before hanging up on Roger.  . 'How did he know you were here? Unless he saw you come into the house.' He said bewildered with what was taking place. 'Saunders you take Kimberly back in your car and have her car impounded so we donât have to worry about any more sudden rides by these two. And Cheyenne is riding back with Me.' he said placing his hand firmly on her shoulder.  Just then the phone began to shoot sparks and blew up. ' What caused that to happen?' Roger asked looking at the phone.  'I think we need to have the houses on the block searched' Saunders said looking at Roger.  'Maybe we can get people to voluntarily to have the houses checked; it would be a lot quicker.' Roger said pulling Cheyenne up by the arm.' See what you can do Saunders.'  Once Roger had Cheyenne safely in his car he turned towards her with anger all over his face.' What the hell has gotten into you Cheyenne?' he yelled at her.  Cheyenne looked at him feeling like a teenager who had been caught skipping school.' I am sorry Roger, but you have to realize its not you heâs coming for, itâs me! I want to find him before he does get me!' she yelled back at him.  'Well running away from me is not going to give you protection either Cheyenne!' he yelled at her as he pulled into the street.' Just sit there and be quiet until we get back to the house!' he said feeling so angry he could have strangled her for her leaving as she did.  'Ok I will as long as you do!' she yelled feeling like she was being scolded by her father.  'Fine itâs a deal! We will both shut up for the ride!' He said fuming inside.  The ride back was very quiet and very tense. Cheyenne would look his way when she knew he was not looking at her. Cheyenne was beginning to calm down when they were half way home.  ' I am sorry Roger for being irresponsible today.' She said looking at her hands in her lap.  Roger took a deep breathe as he looked over at her.' Its ok Cheyenne, I was just scared for you. I am sorry for yelling at you.' He said patting her hands in her lap.  'You know Roger I am glad this has brought us to being friends now, I do respect you, and I do love you, but I am not in love with you as I was before.' She said feeling like she needed to tell him this in case something happened to her and she may never have the chance to ever tell him as the tears fell from her eyes.  'We will always be friends and I do love you more then I have ever or will ever love any other woman. There is no woman for me if I can never have you, and I do know I never will, but I will always be here for you, Always Cheyenne I promise.' he said seeing she was scared especially after today.  Cheyenne leaned over towards him kissing him lightly on his cheek. 'I know Roger and I thank you.' She told him.  When they pulled in the drive way of the house Cheyenne saw Hank sitting on the porch with Norma.' Hanks back!' she said feeling so happy to see her husband.  Roger saw him as he stood up on the porch. Great heâs back. He thought wishing he wasnât. 'So he is back isnât he?' he said trying to hide his feelings.  Cheyenne jumped out of the car when Roger parked, 'Hank! Your home! Oh Hank I have missed you!' she said running and jumping into his arms, she wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck.  Roger looked away as Hank and Cheyenne covered each other in kisses. Why the fuck did he have to come back so soon? Roger thought feeling the jealousy build with in him.' Excuse me Hank was Harrelson still in Dallas when you left?' he asked trying to draw Hanks attention from Cheyenne.  Hank placed Cheyenne on the ground.' As a matter of fact he was on the same plane as I was this morning alone, the woman he was with saw him off at the airport and left by herself. Once back here I followed him to his office waited to see if he was staying which he did and came here when I saw your men had it under surveillance.'  'Good work Hank, did you find anything out in Oregon or Dallas?' he asked Hank as he watched Cheyenne hug on Hank.  'As a matter of fact I did, the woman who I saw him with last night always accompanies him there at Dallas, and she matches the description of the woman seen with him in Oregon the only difference in descriptions with the women who have turned up missing is that they are not petite, the woman last night looked like she was five-foot and weighed about ninety-eight pounds. Other then that the hair and age range are the same.' He said as he noticed Saunders car coming up the road.  'Saunders and I will set up here to help watch the wandering women here , lets see what you can get from Mrs. Harrelson she is not to receptive to me.' Roger told Hank.  'That is a strange house there, I really donât think this guy is involved, at least I donât have anything to believe he is involved directly.' Hank told Roger as Saunders parked his car.  'The prints matched with the ones we lifted from one of the crime scenes Hank, we got lucky when the guy got lazy.' Roger told him.  'Saunders do you know if they got him at the office?' he asked as the man approached them.  'He got away without being detected.' He told him as he felt agitated with this guy as he seems to slip through their fingers all the time.  'We need to get into his office and look around.' Cheyenne said as she was thinking of an idea.  'I take it from your look on your face that you have some wild plan Cheyenne.' Hank told his wife looking down at her as he held her in his arms.  Cheyenne pulled away from Hank. 'I do, what if Norma and I went in as a cleaning crew at night and while she is cleaning she could watch out for anyone to come in so I could go through his files?' she told the three men standing around her.  'I donât like the idea sending you in there Cheyenne since he has singled you out as the next victim.' Roger told Cheyenne.  'Roger another woman has been listed as missing since last night at eight oâclock. She disappeared from the Roller rink waiting for kid sister to come out.' Saunders told him as he stood with his hands on his hips looking out at the sky.  'Son of a bitch! Who is working with this bastard?!' he yelled feeling at a loss. 'Did anyone leave or go to the house last night or any other time?' Roger asked him.  'Not to our knowledge no.' he said knowing his partner was upset with this new turn in the case.  'Ok letâs get working on this to solve it.' He said as he turned to Cheyenne.' and I will see what can be done to get you in the place.' Roger said as he walked to the house.  As the men worked together in the living room Cheyenne and Norma were in Cheyenneâs room picking out wigs to change their appearance. Cheyenne picked out a short blond wig for Norma, a pair of jean overalls and a white t shirt with white sneakers. For herself she chose a long black wig that she would pull back in a pony tail, eye glasses, a pair of white overalls and a blue t shirt with white sneakers.  Roger had found out the name of the Janitorial Company that handled the cleaning of the building Harrelson worked in and managed to get the women to be the cleaning crew for tonight. When he was handed another letter by Saunders sent to him, but this time it came from Cheyenneâs house.  Dear Detective Oâberst,  Still trying to figure out how I am doing all of this? I do want to tell you I will take the utmost pleasure in killing you when the time comes. As I am going to take great pleasure in fucking your little married girlfriend Cheyenne, I will enjoy those firm rounded breast as I taste them as sweet melons.  Roger read the letter, he showed it to the other men.' He is getting off sending us this shit. 'He said as the two men stood around him reading the letter.  'Letâs hope we find out what we need so we can nail him and lock his ass away forever.' Saunders said as he watched Kimberly stuffing her face with a ham and cheese sandwich as she washed it down with a bottle of soda.  ' I think she is getting carried away with the eating for two.' He said laughing.  'She gets any bigger sheâll need a crane to lift her out of here.' Roger said as he looked at her going to the kitchen for chips.  'I hate to see my food bill with her here.' Hank said as he watched her stuffing the chips in her mouth as she walked back to the couch to finish her soap opera as she ate her food.  That night Roger with Hank took Cheyenne and Norma to the van they would be using to go to clean the office in. Hank noticed even in her drab outfit Cheyenne still looked beautiful to him. He was scared of losing her to this creep that was stalking her now. 'I hope this works.' he told Roger as they followed the van driven by a plain clothes officer.  'I do too Hank, just keep your eyes open tonight.' he said as they pulled in front of the building.  Cheyenne and Norma went inside where they found the cart of cleaning supplies in the janitorâs room. As they went through the building they came to Harrelson's office 'well Norma here we are.' Cheyenne said taking a deep breath as she looked at the door.  'Letâs go Cheyenne before I piss my pants from being so nervous.' Norma told her looking around her as her heart was beating wildly.  Once inside Norma went through the garbage cans before dumping them, Cheyenne searched through the files looking for anything that could be of help when she found a file on a group of people.' What is this I wonder?' she said taking the file out to read it. As she read each persons profile she quickly snapped a picture of it.' We might have hit pay dirt Norma.' She said snapping away.  'Cheyenne hurry someone is coming!' she said as she quickly turned on the vacuum cleaner.  'I am done.' She said as she replaced the file back into the drawer grabbing the trash bag.  The door opened slowly as a large bald, black man wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants stuck his head in.' Oh I thought you were the regular cleaning girls in here, I am Otis the security guard here.' He said coming all the way into the room.  'No weâre just the replacements tonight; they should be back tomorrow night. Cheyenne told him noticing how tall he was. H e must be 7 ft tall, so muscular. Cheyenne thought to her self as she looked at him in his tight fitting clothes.  'Well I guess you could do the same for me, see I get benefits from the women who work here at night.' He said smiling as he walked up to Cheyenne and taking off her glasses.  'I donât know what benefits you get from them, but youâll have to wait until tomorrow when they return.' She said backing up.  He grabbed Cheyenne by the arm.' No I donât think you understand, you are what I am getting tonight, now tell your friend to sit down unless she wants to suck on the barrel of my gun.' He said running the gun across Cheyenneâs lips softly.  Cheyenne smiled at him 'sit down Norma just do as he says.' She slowly and sensually licked the barrel of his gun shaft; Cheyenne smiled looking him in the eyes.' You really donât want to do this Otis.' She said trying to reason with him.  'I think I will decide what I want to do, and you will just do it.' He said in a menacing voice, bending to kiss her lips, pulling her body against his that was rock hard, he had an erection against her pelvic.  Cheyenne pulled away from him. 'I donât want to upset you, but if you persist in trying to molest me I am going to have to kick your ass.' She told him still smiling.  Otis began laughing. 'Oh really your going to kick my ass are you?' he said holding her tighter as she felt his erection up against her body taking her hand making her touch it. 'Thatâs all for you. Now remove your clothes so I can enter your hot body.' He said rubbing her hand on his erection. 'donât want to take your clothes off get on your knees and let me choke you as you suck it.' He said biting his bottom lip rubbing her hand on his erection harder, 'I want to **** you bitch!' He said grabbing her grinding her hips against him.  'Ok I am tired of you now.' She said as she quickly knocked the gun out of his hand with her other hand and began to punch him in his throat and chest. Cheyenne did not stop kicking and punching the large man.   Otis was having trouble breathing after Cheyenneâs direct punch to his Adams apple. Cheyenne was a black belt in karate and she kept up her attack on him until he fell to the floor.' Stop, please stop.' Otis cried out in pain.  Cheyenne knelt down next to him.' I told you I didnât want to do it didnât I? She told him in a taunting voice. 'Now we are going to leave while you just lay there like a good boy ok?' she told him as she flicked him the back of his head.  'Ok just leave me alone.' He said as he lay on his stomach.  As the two women were leaving the office Cheyenne looked back at him.' Oh by the way Otis, have a nice night.' She said going out the door.  The women hurried outside to the waiting van where they told the officer waiting for them of Otis. 'I will radio Roger and inform him.' He said as he got on the radio with Roger. 'Cheyenne said the security guard just tried to attack her up in the office he is still there.'  'Have someone pick him up.' Roger said.' Are they ok?'  The officer laughed.' yeah but from what she says he isnât.'  Roger laughed.' Cheyenne got him good.' Roger said over the radio. 'Take them back to the house we will meet you there.' Roger instructed the officer as he planned to pay the security guard a visit. 'Letâs go up and see if he knows anything.'  'Letâs go and do it then.' Hank told Roger getting out of the car. The two men went to the office where the guard was still laying in pain. Roger walked over to him 'Get up.' he ordered the man.  'Who the fuck are you?' Otis groaned in pain.  'I am Detective Oâberst and you just tried to assault two women in here.' He said as he watched the man trying to get to his feet.  'That broad is crazy man, she assaulted me!' He said disgustedly.  Hank stood looking at the man who had just tried to assault his wife.' you tried to assault her and your pride got bruised when she kicked you senseless.' Hank said feeling rage build with in him.  'I never touched her in anyway what so ever!' Otis yelled.  Roger smiled as he loosened his burgundy tie. 'well we know someone here is responsible for six missing women , we get a complaint that you just tried to force your self on a woman, I think you might be who we are looking for.' Roger said hoping this would shake him up to start talking.' We are hauling you in for questioning and possibly charges of false imprisonment of two females.' Roger began playing his hand.   Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  'Wait a minute man! I had nothing to do with no female or females disappearing, and how in the hell could anyone hold that crazed bitch against her will? She is a reincarnated female Bruce Lee.' He said rubbing his throat.  The door opened with Sheriffs standing there.' You need this guy taken in detective?' the younger officer asked.  'Yes I do for questioning of the women who have been abducted.' Roger told the men.' I will meet you there.' Roger said as he and Hank left.  'Man you arenât right, I never abducted any woman.' He said as the officer placed him in hand cuffs.  Hank and Roger went to the station to see what they could get out of Otis. Cheyenne and Norma arrived back at the house to be greeted by Saunders.' How did it go tonight?' he asked sitting in the rocking chair on the porch.  'Well besides Cheyenne beating up some huge black man tonight, good.' Norma said as she sat on the step of the porch.  Saunders was smiling at Cheyenne.  ' Bully, what happened?' He asked teasingly.  'The security guard evidently has an arrangement where he has sex with the cleaning crew, and he would not take no for an answer, so I just had to show him who was in charge of the situation.' She said laughingly.  'You should have taken your friend; she could have eaten her way out. She has not stopped yet. I was going to grab a sandwich, but I was afraid of having to wrestle her to the ground for it.' He said as he looked in the window pointing at Kimberly.  Norma looked famish rubbing her stomach.' God I hope there is something left, all that excitement has made me hungry.' Norma said with a smile.' That is if it is alright with you Cheyenne if I get something.' Norma said not wanting to be any more of a bother then her and her daughter were by staying there.  'Norma please stop being so goofy, letâs go in and whip up something to eat.' She told the other woman.  ' Come on Saunders that includes your help too.' She said pulling him up from the chair.  As the three of them whipped up cheese burgers, Cole slaw, baked beans, corn on the cob for everyone to feast on. Saunders looked at Cheyenne 'You know I was sorry when you and Roger broke up, are you really happy now?' he asked as he diced onions for the baked beans.  'Yes I am, very much, I am glad though that Roger and I have a better relationship now as friends.' She told him flipping the burgers.  'He really did love you Cheyenne, and I think he still does.' He said mixing in the onions to the beans.  'I will always have a special spot in my heart for him, but I have a good man that I will never leave for any reason.' She told him flipping the burgers.  Kimberly came into the kitchen to join everyone.' God that smells great I canât wait to eat.' She said looking at the food cooking.  'Damn it woman! do you ever stop eating?' Saunders asked her as he looked at her with disgust.   'When she is sleeping, well maybe she does.' Cheyenne said teasing Kimberly.  'Go to hell Cheyenne I am pregnant.' She whined as she put a grape in her mouth.  'What was your excuse before the pregnancy Kim?' she asked as she saw how mad she was getting.  'Youâre just so funny.' Kimberly said as she flung a grape at Cheyenne.  Norma looked at Kimberly 'I guess we could have her clothes made at Omarâs the tent maker.' She said trying to join in on the fun.  Kimberly walked over to her mother slapping her across the face as hard as she could.' You fucking bitch, I will kick your ass again!' she screamed at Norma like a crazy woman.  Cheyenne ran to the women and stood between them.' Look Kimberly you will not treat her like this! Not in my home!' she told her in a firm voice.' Are you ok Norma?' she asked looking at the red welt on her face.  Kimberly looked hatefully at her mother.' I am sorry Cheyenne, I lost my cool.' She said sitting down at the kitchen table.  Hank and Roger finally arrived back at the house about an hour later just in time for dinner. After dinner they sat outside on the porch where Cheyenneâs black cat jumped up on her lap.' And where have you been Ninja?' she asked petting his head as the cat purred loudly as he got comfortable on top of her lap.  They all sat on the porch Norma looked at Roger looking at the sky as the stars sparkled brightly. 'Beautiful night.' She said trying to start a conversation with him.  'Yes it is, but it feels weird tonight.' He said still looking at the sky.  Cheyenne could see the sun rising bringing her out of her deep thoughts of the past and she knew she had to go on without her beloved Roger by her side or in her arms.  That week the women were planning for the wedding that one of the high council would perform the ceremony. The mansion sparkled with glittering beautiful flowers of purples; the gazebo richly decorated with roses that glittered, the ceremony would start at midnight.  Cheyenne and Lindsey traveled all over the world to find the perfect wedding dresses with the six other witches while Roger took the men across the country finding the perfect tuxedos. The men found white tuxedos, with black sashes and bow ties, ruffled shirts with white shoes.  Cheyenne and Lindsey agreed on long tight fitting white satin gowns, that had plunging v neck lines, opened backs, the sleeves long and made out of lace, the veils long with a piece that covered their face , they choose diamond necklaces, and white heels. Under the gowns, they would wear white corsets with matching bustiers, white thigh high lace nylons.  Wednesday was the bachelor party, Roger arranged for female strippers to be there to liven up the party they would be having in Miami Beach Florida in a hotel. Tammy over heard his phone call as well as the location of the hotel after he left the room she hit redial canceled his six female strippers then quickly went to tell Cheyenne what she had done and what they were going to do.  That night the men were in the hotel room drinking while they waited for their sexy hot little blond bimboâs. Cheyenne and the seven other witches created five of the heaviest, ugliest female strippers that showed up wearing long Jackets to cover their thongs and one very heavy female dominatrix dressed in all black leather and tight fitting vest, leather thongs with matching garter belt holding up fish net stockings with black spiked heels and she was for Roger. After all, it was going to be his surprise for the men; the women turned his surprise around on him. Cheyenne told the woman she created for Roger.' make sure you make him enjoy being a bad boy, he will need to be spanked a few times. Then I think you should make him tell you that all women are his leaders and he will always obey. Make him lick and suck on your toes too.' Cheyenne told her then busted out into laughter a long with the other witches. She cast a spell on the men so they would be without their powers while they were in the room with the women, but it would return once they escaped.  The women arranged it so they could have a home theater to watch what happens in the comfort of their living room. Cheyenne even arranged to tape it so they could watch it when they needed a good laugh. The men had left for the bachelor party. They each wore casual attire thinking they were going to a few bars. Cheyenne and all the women of the house sat in front of the large screen with their pop corn and soda.  The men arrived at the hotel where the other two looked around the room.' Roger what are you up too?' Hank asked thinking they were going to a bar.  'I ordered the hottest sexiest 6 strippers to come here, two for each of us.' He told the men who looked at him disbelief.  'I am not staying here, Cheyenne finds out and weâre over with.' He told him turning to leave.  'Itâs expected to sow your oats at your bachelor party.' He told them.  'You get us killed by Cheyenne and Lindsey we are going to make you regret it.' Saunders said rubbing his hands together.  There was a knock at the door, Roger had a huge smile on his face when he opened it the big dominatrix woman. His face turned to pure shock as he looked at her wondering what was going on.  'Are you Roger?' she asked him.  'Yes why?' he asked the huge woman.  'You ordered us! Move out of my way you naughty boy!' She ordered him. She shoved him back into the room and the other five women came in removing their jackets then grabbed the men.  The women were laughing as they watched the fear on Rogers face as the woman grabbed him putting him over her knees.' Bad, bad boy!' she yelled spanking him with a leather strap.  Hank was grabbed by three of the strippers.  ' you like it rough; we will take turns being on top of you. 'They said pushing him on the bed. The women jumped on the bed covering him in kisses and pulling at his clothes while he yelled for help. He tried to get away by using his magic only to find out it did not work. 'oh my God!' he said as the one that had to weigh four hundred pounds sat on top of him forcing his hands on her ass.' I am going to give it to you good and hard.' She told him as she grinded her body on his. She kissed him as the others removed his pants Hank fought to get away.  Saunders as well was being attacked by the other two heavy women as one held him down and the other pulled his pants off. The one straddling him looked down at him smiling. 'You better get it up.,' she told him as she licked his face. He too found out his magic was gone as well as Roger as he was being spanked as he yelled out in fear. 'Cheyenne! Help me!' he yelled out with each spank from the strap.  The eight witches were in tears as they laughed so hard watching the men struggle to get away from the six hot babes. 'Teaches them right.' Norma said as she laughed at the menâs plight.  Finally Saunders was able to get away to help Hank then they saved Roger just as he was going to have to suck and lick the womanâs toes.   'Thatâs what you call hot strippers?' Saunders asked as they ran out the door.  Once the men ran out of the room the eight witches then changed into dresses that hardly covered their nipples and they didnât need to bend over to show their assâs as they went to the patio where they had ten of the most handsome, hottest male strippers one for each woman including Aggatha and Norma. They made each of them very well endowed.  'Damn look at that.' Cheyenne said as she looked at one of them who had been extremely gifted by the witches. 'I mean damn look at him, I want him.' She said not taking her eyes off of his gift smiling.' To make Hank jealous is what I meant, not that I would even consider riding that thang!' she said jumping up in his arms and grinding while she laughed. She looked into his blue eyes, black curly hair and a body that could only come from over sexed witches. 'Ooh talented too.' She said smiling as he made his gift move against her crotch.  'Letâs get in our places on the patio incase they realize they have powers and pop back in here.' Lindsey told them as she picked the blond, blue eyed one then smacking his ass in his blue thong.  The men popped into the house to see these men in just thongs pushing their male organs in the womenâs faces. The women were going crazy screaming. They stood there watching with their arms crossed.  Cheyenne who was sitting in a patio chair as the man with the great gift laid it between her cleavage, still wearing his thong making it do push upâs, she had her hands on his ass.  The men walked out on the patio even Aggatha and Norma were acting like animals they could not believe it.' Are you ladies having fun?' Roger asked rubbing his buttocks that still stung from his spanking.  'Why are you back here?' the women asked angrily .  ' Arenât you supposed to be doing bachelor things?' Cheyenne asked them trying not to laugh as the man was still over her.  'Well just say it didnât work and get rid of these guys will you?' Hank asked looking at the guy with the gift getting upset.  'Fine.' They said making them disappear.  The happy now that they ruined the girls evening since they escaped Nightmare in Miami. 'We are going to go fishing where it is safe.' Hank said as he and Saunders gave Roger a dirty look.  'Hey I suffered pain you two didnât.' he told them rubbing his buttocks even more.  The women wasnât aware that something evil had watched what they had done and recreated what the women created for the men, but in a much sexier version then the ones they had created. They also cast a spell that they could not resist what they created for themselves nor would the men be able to resist the women that had been made as a joke would turn out to be the creations of evil to kill everyone of them during sex so the wedding could not take place. The Dark Side was making sure there would be no more High Priestess or a new High Priest. The others would just be reducing the number of the warriors for the white light.  The women decided to call it an evening. Cheyenne decided to take a shower before turning in for the night while Hank was fishing. Cheyenne stood in the shower with soap on her face, she could not open her eyes as he caressed her breast. 'Ooh Hank you decided to come back instead of going fishing?' she asked as she was feeling such hot pleasure from his hands when she felt the man up against her back, realizing who it was, she hurriedly rinsed off. He kissed the back of her neck pushing his hardness up against her, as hard as she tried to fight the temptation she could not. She turned around facing him where he lifted her up wrapping her legs around him.   'Ride that thang!' he told her as he kissed her taking her to her bed. When he threw her on the bed, she broke the spell. She tried to get away realizing something had gone terribly wrong with the spell when they made these men. Using her powers she was able to blow him up running out of the room to find Alicia struggling to get away from her attacker .Cheyenne flung her hand throwing him into the wall blowing him up using both hands.' Come on something went wrong with the spell.' She told her as they ran to the other rooms where they found Aggatha being strangled by one of their creations.  ' Mother fucker!' Cheyenne yelled as she knocked him off her and Alicia blew him up.  'Make sure she is ok.' She said running to Normaâs room where she laid dead in the bed. Cheyenne stumbled backwards seeing her dead. 'Normaâ¦' she whispered watching the man get out of the bed to attack Cheyenne, she blew him up. Quickly she began yelling as she ran down the hall.' Fight it!'   Tammy blew up the man who tried to attack her.  'What went wrong Cheyenne?' she asked as they separated to save the rest.  'Evil intervened thatâs what happened.' She said going to Cathyâs room. Cathy had the man floating in the air and blew him up.  All the women survived except for poor Norma who was killed.  'If evil turned our spells on us, then what about the men?' Gloria asked.  The women without saying a word appeared on the boat where they found the women they created redone to sexy vixens of the dark side. they were trying to kill the men as hard as the men fought they still could not manage to get their magic to work because the eight witches had made it where their magic was out of order when they were with the women they created.  Cheyenne walked up to the three who had Hank down beating him while one strangled him.' hey you three bitches come meet your maker.' She said as the three women turned around just as Cheyenne blew them up. 'C-ya!' she told the smoke they left behind.  All the other women had been taken care of except the dominatrix; no matter how hard they tried, they could not blow her up. Cheyenne changed into her warrior clothes looking at the woman.  ' Ready to rumble?' she asked jumping up in the air spinning in a circle three times landing her feet on the fore head of the woman knocking her backwards. Cheyenne was able to throw Roger to the other side of the boat to get him out of harms way. She tried blowing her up, but it did not work on her. 'Uh oh.' She said looking at the huge woman growling at her.  The seven other witches each threw a dagger that giant female pulled out of her heart. 'This is going to be a long night.' Lindsey said looking at the woman.  The three warlocks and eight witches hoped the number eleven would be her un lucky number as they stood together as she walked towards them laughing they were able to blow her up.  'Now that was one tough bitch!' Margaret told them as she was out of breath from fighting with the big bully.  When they got back to the house Norma was sitting in on the patio. Cheyenne was leery walking up to her. 'Norma is that you or something else?' she asked walking slowly towards the woman.  'Yes Cheyenne, it is really Norma. the council has made me the guardian of all of you. That means I am to foresee when evil is approaching, and I have the power to heal and restore life as long as it has not been for along time and only on the good attacked by evil.' She explained to them.' Now we have a problem thereâs a group of evil warlocks who is intent on stopping this wedding because once you and Hank are united by the High council then we will have a High Priest as well as a High Priestess and evil is not crazy about Mystic Shadow. They really are not happy with Hank either or any of us for that matter. At the ceremony Hank will be given his High priest name.' She told them.  'So where are the evil warlockâs?' Roger asked Aggatha.  'Unfortunately I can not tell you I donât have that power, but just an image that you have to vanquish.' She answered him.' If this group is not vanquished there canât be a wedding for we canât take a chance of them getting to one of the High Council.  Cheyenne thought for a moment.' Perhaps the book can help us.' she said going to the room they made in the mansion where no one could find for it was behind a false wall. They opened the wall where all their pendulums and the ingredients of the potions were kept along with the book.  Cheyenne and the otherâs sat around it in a circle as Cheyenne laid her hands upon it saying these wordsâ¦â¦â¦  I Mystic shadow need help from the Witches' Word  I call upon the high council past and present Who have watched over the Moon the sun above and Earth below  to help me prepare   in this right and ready hour,  fill these pages with Thy spiritual power.  May no evil eye to see or possess the witches word  the secrets which have been entrusted with in thee  to help us find this hidden path  to find the evil who wish the death of thee and all that is good  hear me and lend Thy protection:  Revealing the truths of Earth and the Skies  show us the group of evil warlocks to our eyes.   For us the eight Witches whose book this belongs make us a map that is strong   to make our path the way to go be plain to see.  So we may continue to serve and protect for the good; so that through the coming centuries we shall still be.  Cheyenne raised her hands above the book where the pages began to turn by them selves showing them the evil warlocks. 'Itâs the four evil warlocks that traps the souls of the innocent children keeping them locked in a dark cavern. If we vanquish them, we will also free the childrenâs souls.' She told the others.  Cheyenne held her crystal charm over a map it stopped in Jamaica in the same area they were at. 'They are here. We have to cast a spell to make them appear before us.' She told them.  Cheyenne went to a wooden box and took out thirteen wooden pentacles.' Take this and hang them around your necks it will help to give us protection.' She told them as she handed each of them one. She placed hers around her neck.' Aggatha we will need a potion to vanquish these warlockâs. It will not be an easy task either. They are very powerful due to all the childrenâs souls they have collected through the centuries. Tammy write a spell so we can bring them to us on our turf.' She said looking worried.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©  She looked at the three men with a wave of her hand she changed their clothes. They were now dressed similar to the women warriorsâ suit.  ' These warrior clothes have been blessed by the Higher Power to give us more protection and strength.' She told them as the women transformed into theirs.  'If we lose this battle today all the childrenâs souls who have not been collected will be today. We cannot let them win. There are a lot of innocents involved, itâs not just about a wedding.' She told them standing up as she read to herself the spell to be cast.  'How is the potion coming?' she asked Aggatha.  'Itâs done and it will not only send them to hell, but where no one wants to go.' She said.  'Where is that?' Hank asked.  'Where they feed him the evil souls that lost the battle. I just made it so they wonât have to wait in line.' She said smiling.  Ok we should be on the patio where we have more room to move as soon as I cast my spell I have to hit them with the potion.' Cheyenne told them. 'Are we ready to go do this?' she asked everyone.' Norma will stay here. You will be safe behind these doors.' She said smiling at Norma.  They all stood in the middle of the patio in a circle holding hands as Cheyenne began the first spell.  'I Mystic shadow High Priestess of all that is good,  Demand before me the four evil collectors of children souls.  Where I may destroy them where no one else could.  Place in this circle instantly my evil foes.'  Lightening began to crackle; the window began to blow with such force. It was not long that the four evil warlocks appeared in a sparkling fog in the center of the circle. the wind began to blow as hard as a hurricane , Cheyenne began to glow in a white light as the men began to attack the twelve where they used all their magic to hold them while Cheyenne chanted the next spell.  'I Mystic shadow High priestess of all that is good   Take my magical chains to bind these evil souls   As they have been captured by the powerful twelve  Wishing for their evil souls be fed to he the evil one of darkness  Using this potion to vanquish them sending them pass hell  Like we knew it would   I Mystic Shadow High Priestess order the   Release of the innocents souls from the cavern of these evil foes. As the magical chains that glitter of gold and silver wrapped it self around the four men Cheyenne now poured the potion on them.  'You bitch this is not going to work and we will fuck your Highness before collecting your soul.' one of them threatened.  Then Cheyenne smiling at all four of the black haired warlocks dressed in long black jackets, shirts, pants and boots began to disappear.  'Um I think its working.' she said smugly pointing at half of their disappearing bodies.   When the warlocks saw their bodies disappearing, they began to scream for they now felt all the pain of their victims and they were gone.  'We did it!' Aggatha said excitedly.  'It would have worked before, but everyone was all too fearful of them so they always won.' Cheyenne told them looking up at the sky knowing now the childrenâs souls were safe.  The day had come for the two couples to unite for eternity. Cheyenne and Lindsey were so nervous during the day they could not eat a bite of food. When nine oâclock arrived the six other witches came to the room where they waited to begin preparing for the ceremony which would begin at midnight in the gazebo. Tammy, Patty and Cathy would work on Cheyenne giving her a mud mask, waxing her legs, bikini line, then a hot oil treatment on her hair, then bathing her in the oils. They rolled her hair in curlers, as they gave her a pedicure and a French manicure on her nails. They put her in her matching corset and bustier with the thigh high lace nylons, they had her hair in long French curls pulled back with a diamond hair clip.  Cheyenne looking at her and Lindseyâs hair she began to laugh. 'We look like weâre from Gone with the wind.' she told her.  'Now all we need is for Rhett to come in and say frankly my dear I donât give a damn. 'Lindsey said laughing as Margaret, Gloria and Alicia worked on her.  Itâs time for the dresses the women told her as they helped them into each of the dresses ,the diamond earrings and necklaces when Aggatha came in with a box 'Cheyenne must wear these.' She said opening the box as she showed Cheyenne the Diamond clustered necklace that looked as if it belonged to a Queen, with diamond clustered earrings and bracelet.' Oh they are so beautiful.' Cheyenne said looking in the mirror as a vision came to her of her mother wearing these.' they were mothers werenât they?' she asked as tears came to her eyes.  'yes she made me promise when you were going to go into the holy union for me to have you wear these for itâs what she wore when she was united to Murkshadow.' She told her grand daughter as tears filled her eyes remembering her beloved daughter.' your parents would be very proud of you Mystic Shadow.' She told her calling her by her given name at birth.  Cheyenne hugged her grandmother.' I love you.' She told her.  'Alright now stop before we have big puffy eyes from crying.' Aggatha told her.  The seven witches had tears in their eyes at the endearment of these two strong women they loved and respected so much.  'Great you got us in here crying.' Tammy said as every one started laughing.  They placed the veils on the women and using magic got ready in their hands maiden outfits Tammy and Alicia dresses of light red gowns with white lace on the straps, with matching light red heels and a crown of daisyâs on their heads.  As they walked down the stairs to go to the gazebo the hand maidens were on each side of their bride as the other women walked behind in them in long blue gowns the same as the hand maidens.  The men were waiting on the other side of the gazebo where they could not see their brides coming to them. As Cheyenne began to walk down the red carpet leading to the gazebo a white sparkling fog began to float in the air as tiny little fairies flew around her for this was their High Priestess and they were sprinkling fairy dust on her that glittered to give her protection  There was a beautiful woman with long red hair playing a harp as they approached. All of her followers were there to witness the union and meet their new High Priest that would help lead and protect them.  Once at the gazebo they stopped where they could not see the men.  And now the ceremony will begin to commence for the holy union.      THE WEDDING  âThere are two couples who wish to be united tonight as two separate couples joining with their chosen mates as one. Hand maidens bring forth the brides.â The elderly man dressed in along white robe with a glittering rope around his waist, wearing tan sandals, he was balding with a silvery short beard.   Tammy held Cheyenneâs hand leading her to the altar before the man. Alicia bringing Lindsey before him.  âHandmaiden what is the name of the bride?â he asked looking at Tammy.   âHer name is Mystic Shadow our High Priestess your lordship,â she said as she curtseys before him.  âYou may go back to your place leaving Mystic Shadow our High Priestess at the alter.â He told her as she left to take her place with the others. âHand maiden what is the name of the bride?â he asked Alicia.  âHer name is Lindsey your lordship.â Alicia told him as she curtseys before him.  âYou may take your place leaving Lindsey at the altar.â He told her as she took her place next to Tammy with the others. âGrooms man brings forth the grooms.â He told Roger and he asked.  â What is the grooms name and who does he wish to be united with at the holy altar?â   âHis name is Hank and he wishes to unite with Mystic Shadow our High Priestess our lordship.â He told him.  âAnd the other grooms name is?â he asked  âHis name is John and he wishes to unite with Lindsey your lord ship.â He told him as he bowed before him.  âVery well you may take your place with the others.  Turning to Cheyenne and Hank. âDo you Mystic Shadow our High Priestess do wish to become one with this man Hank?â he asked her.  Mystic Shadow looked back at Roger as if she was waiting for him to stop her. âYes High council I do.â She replied longing in her heart that it was Roger standing by her side. A tear fell from her eye unto the wedding bouquet.  âAnd do you Hank wish to become one with Mystic Shadow?â he asked.  âYes your lordship I do.â He replied  Turning to John and Lindsey.â Do you Lindsey wish to become one with John?â he asked.  âOh yes your lordship.â She replied with all the love she felt in her heart..  âAnd do you John wish to become one with Lindsey.â He asked.  âYes your lord ship.â He replied.  âOur mighty Lord, our highest power we ask that you bless and protect these couples becoming one tonight to give them your love and protection from those whose might wish them harm in their union. We ask that of all of our holy beings to tie these couples in holy union tonight to keep them bonded in love , to be understanding, kind, to make love often never losing their sensuality for one another, let their be not hurtful words spoken to one another for love is not unkind nor does it hurt. Grooms always love and protect your brides for she is your soul mate from this night forward.  Now Mystic Shadow our High Priestess by taking Hank as your Husband he shall now become Murkcaster our High Priest. And now will both brides and grooms place the rings that represent the circle of your love on each otherâs left hand.  The couples each placed their gold bands on their chosen ones finger.  âAs our Mighty Lord and Higher Power and all of our beloved ancestors are the witnesses to these couples becoming one to love for eternity. Now I ask that each couple light the candle of Life.â He told them. Now grooms lifting the veils of your brides you may seal this union with a kiss.â  Murkcaster lifted the veil of Mystic Shadow and John lifted Lindseyâs. They sealed their Holy union with a kiss.  There began trumpets playing as the brides and grooms walked down the red carpet, their guest welcomed the newly wed couples.  Inside the mansion some of the witches had turned it into a huge reception center where the brides and grooms sat at their table and the guest would come up to dance with the bride or groom. Then it came for the brides and grooms waltz where both couples danced their first dance together as soul mates.  The high council made an announcement.â we had a special request today concerning our High Priestess. Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster please join me here in the center of the room. Mystic Shadow here is the special request.â He told her then stepping back.  A bright white light came floating down slowly when Mystic Shadow's parents stepped out of the bright light hugging their daughter and welcoming Murkcaster to the family.  âHow is this possible?â she asked her parents as tears ran down her face.  âWe were granted to be able to watch your union to our new High Priest and then for just a few minutes of life to be able to hug and kiss our little girl. Remember Mystic Shadow we are always with you. Murkcaster keep up the fine work of loving and protecting our child.â They told them then stepped back into the light where it lifted them back to the heavens.   Most of the guest gave their High Priest and High Priestess gifts of gold, diamonds and rubies to show their love and loyalty to them except for one witch who was known for being wise and was Mystic Shadowâs mothers right hand witch Mysticlure. âTo you My Lord and Lady I give to you the gift of life to share and to love always.â She said waving her hand across the couple smiling as she walked away.  Then the High Council closing the celebration of the Holy Unions tonight gave Lindsey and Saunders a honeymoon trip to Paris.  Looking at Hank and Cheyenne.â I ask you to join me so you may begin your Holy union bliss.â He told them as they vanished into a white mist that was bright and sparkled.  They appeared in a beautiful room, there was a king size bed with a huge golden headboard with very fine intricate design. The comforter was of royal blue with light blue satin sheets and pillowcases, there was a balcony that sparkled like diamonds and crystals. The high Council left when two handmaidens came into get Mystic Shadow and two groomsâ men came in for Hank. They were cleansed in a large round bath with candles and incenses were burned. Cheyenneâs body was rubbed down with oils and clothed in a white satin gown that flowed when she walked. The bodice made with white lace, white slippers with heels were placed on her feet. She was brought back into their richly decorated room of gold tables, lamps that sparkled as if they were diamonds. She was placed in the bed where her pillows were propped behind her back. Hank had gone through the same ritual and placed in black satin pajamas and placed in bed next to Cheyenne where they were giving aphrodisiacs .â drink these.â they told them as they handed them gold goblets.  They stood there; they made sure it was all drank before leaving them alone in the room. They began to feel strange, Hank took Cheyenne into his arms kissing her softly, his hand ran down her body raising her gown up and removing it then removing his own as he brought his body over herâs and entered her slowly as their bodies began to move slowly together . He went deeper and harder as he kissed and sucked on her nipples, their breathing becoming heavier he could hear soft moans coming from Cheyenne as he rolled on his back having her on top of him caressing her breast. She moved in a slow sensual grinding movement. The heat and passion grew in their bodies; he grabbed her hips forcing them to go down on him. He went in side of her moistness even deeper, she drove him crazy with desire sitting on top of him caressing her breast. She rode him slowly and deeply until they exploded in a heated passion as lightening bolts was striking all around the room. They did not stop as if they had not noticed what was taking place around them. They made love for hours until they were exhausted falling to sleep in each others arms.  The next morning while they slept all the witches and warlocks, fairies every creature of good even Mystic Shadowâs seven witches , Aggatha, Norma, Roger and Saunders were at the palace where Mystic Shadow and Murkcaster were dressed like a queen and king as they sat on their thrones. When all of the High council came to give an important announcement.  âLast night the union of our High Priest and High Priestess was consummated and the royal child was conceived!â  Hank and Cheyenne looked shocked at each other as everyone in the palace cheered for the royal birth. Cheyenne leaned over to Hank.â I am pregnant. Iâm pregnant!â she said as they jumped up hugging and kissing at the news of the birth to come. Mystic Shadow turned to face the crowd, her eyes met Rogerâs eyes and she could see the sadness in them, but now she was bound to Hank for eternity.    Cheyenne remembered the day the Dark side kidnapped her and changed her life forever.  The wind began to blow harder when they all noticed the sky began to glow almost fluorescent green.' Look at the sky isnât that a strange color for at night?' Saunders said pointing at the green haze.  'Yes it is I wonder what is causing it?' Hank asked standing up looking at the sky.   It seemed to be moving towards them, Cheyenne went to the middle of the drive way to see it better, it was right over her when it appeared to be getting lower and suddenly it was surrounding Cheyenne' What is going on?' she yelled as she tried to get away from it, she struggled as if someone or something had its grip on her and she could not get away from it no matter how hard she tried. In a split second she was gone from the spot she had been standing in, all that was left behind was a rat with a decapitated head. Kimberly and Norma began screaming and crying as they tried to conceive what had just happened to Cheyenne. Ralph was barking and running around the green light as Ninja sat on the porch steps hissing at the green fog that lit up the night. Not realizing that their lives would never be the same. The men stood helplessly in the spot where Cheyenne had just been standing Suddenly everything went silent, even the womenâs screaming and crying could no longer be heard, just the sound of the tree rustling in the breeze.  Hank, Roger and Saunders stood where Cheyenne had just been standing and vanished. 'Where is she?' Hank yelled hysterically as he dropped to his knees crying.' What the fuck is going on here?' he cried looking up at the sky.  Roger was trying to remain calm to get his senses about him.' I donât know she just vanished!' He said not believing what he had just witnessed.' What are we dealing with here?' he asked looking at Saunders who was just as frightened and puzzled with what took place here.  The women remained on the front porch crying afraid to venture out where the men were standing. Kimberly began to feel sick to her stomach, she ran to the end of the patio where she began to vomit violently. Norma was frozen with fear to help her.' Where could she have gone?' Norma cried realizing that they may never see Cheyenne alive again.  Roger knew he had to get Hank to pull himself together.' Look Hank we both love Cheyenne, so if we are going to get her back we need to get ourselves together here and go straight to the bastardâs house.' He said pulling Hank up by the collar of his shirt.  Hank looked at him with defeat in his eyes. 'Donât you understand? She vanished in some green smoke, right into thin air! Do you really think he is going to zap her back to his fucking house?' he asked pushing his hands off him.  Saunders saw the tension growing between the two men.' Both of you just stop it! Cheyenne would not want this! sheâd want you to work together, so for her both of you assholes just fucking do it!' he said feeling so angry for not being able to prevent this.' Letâs go find Harrelson.' He told the two men glaring at each other.  Saunders looked at the two women.' Come on if youâre going or stay here alone.' He said knowing he had to protect them from whatever this was they had encountered.   Cheyenne woke up to find herself strapped to a cold metal table, her clothes were gone, there was a huge bright light above her. 'What happened?' she whispered feeling very groggy her vision blurry.  'You have been abducted like me.' A female voice was telling her.  Cheyenne turned her head in the direction of the voice. 'Who are you?' she asked the woman lying naked on another metal table beside her.  'My name is Tammy Anderson they got me last night.' She said as tears came to her eyes. 'Youâll feel groggy for a little longer then you will be back to yourself,' she said crying as the door opened.  Cheyenneâs vision was blurry, but she could make out Mrs. Harrelson standing by the table. 'You, it has been you the whole time. 'She said trying to focus her eyes.  'Welcome Cheyenne, I have been trying to control my anticipation for your arrival with us.' She said running her hand through her hair softly, kissing her lips softly with her own.   Cheyenne was trying to grasp what was happening here.' You set us up by making us look for your husband.' She said in a low soft voice.  'Oh you will be meeting my husband very soon dear; in fact he canât wait to meet you.' She said looking at Cheyenneâs body as she kissed her softly on her lips and caressed her breast wanting to do more to her.  Cheyenne was scared as she tried to move her face away from her.  ' Stop please.' She said in a low voice. She was feeling ill by her kiss and fondling of her breast.  'Rest now; Fredrick will want you rested when he returns here.' She said smiling evilly    Seduced By An Entity Ch. 04 by Erotica_Writings Â©    Mrs. Harrelson told her then went to the next table.' Mmmm very nice, you will be all mine to enjoy.' she said cupping her breast in her hands as she ran her tongue Tammyâs lips with her tongue.' No please donât hurt me.' She cried.  Mrs. Harrelson smiled evilly at Tammy. 'You wonât be hurt as long as you pleasure me darling girl.' She told Tammy and kissed her passionately as she ran her hand over Tammyâs body.  Cheyenne was becoming more aware of herself and her surroundings.' Leave her alone you dyke bitch!' Cheyenne yelled trying to help the woman next to her.  'You would have been mine, but Fredrick has chosen you for his.' She said as she walked out the door.  Cheyenne raised her head up to look at the other woman. 'Are you alright?' Cheyenne asked the woman next to her.  Tammy began crying. 'God these people are from another world, their eyes glow green.' She told Cheyenne trying to suppress her tears and the fear of death that she was feeling with her every being.  Green, I saw a green light last before blanking out. She thought to herself. She struggled to get out of the straps, but they tightened more every time she struggled. She laid there wondering what was going to become of them.' Have you seen any other women?' she asked Tammy.  'All the women who have vanished are here, they bring water and food in here, and they look so strange.' She said.  The door opened as Fredrick Harrelson walked in. 'Beautiful.' He said standing over Cheyenne gazing over her nude body.' I can not wait any longer; I will have them prep you for our union.' He told her touching her nipples.  Cheyenne recognized three of the missing women taking her out of her straps, when Cheyenne tried to break away they sent electrical shock waves through her.' Behave and you wonât be hurt!' they told her as they dragged her out of the room.  They took Cheyenne to a room with a large bathtub where they scrubbed her body. Cheyenne could not hide the tears that rolled down her cheeks. 'What happened to you women? Why have you turned to their side?' she asked as they washed her hair.  'He is our God, we are to worship him.' One of the girls told her.  'Silence she needs not to learn too much, just that she has been chosen his queen.' Gloria said.  'What Queen? What about his wife?' she asked feeling more confused.  'Itâs up to him to tell you what he wants you to know.' She said.  As Cheyenne was being dried with towels she noticed Gloria Luchese.' Gloria I saw your mother the other day and sheâ¦' she said trying to get an ally to help her.  'That part of my life no longer exist, this is my family here.' She said holding a green satin gown with emeralds across the bodice.  'I have a family that I love very dearly, please help me!' She pleaded with them.  As the women looked at Cheyenne their eyes began to glow green.  ' soon you will join us Cheyenne.' They said smiling.  Cheyenne was petrified wondering who was now inhabiting the bodies of the missing women. Would there be a way to get the women back? 'Please I love only one man, my husband.' She cried thinking of Hank and how he must be frantic with worry.  The women led Cheyenne to a room with a large bed covered with a canopy; it looked like a room out of Beverly Hills with its lavish furnishing. There were fruits in a bowl, champagne on ice. What the fuck will I do? She thought to herself.  Soon Fredrick entered the room.' Leave us alone.' He ordered the women. 'Now if you want your husband and friends kept alive you will do as youâre told. When we make love you must be into it as much as I or they will die and then I will turn you over to your friend Otis to be his slave instead of my queen.' He told her as he flashed on a screen showing Hank and her friends in the car looking for her.  ' you see we always know what is going on with them and can arrange their demise at any time.' He said pouring her a glass of champagne.' Drink this so we may begin, I am very anxious to have you.' He said handing her the glass.  Cheyenne knew she had to do what she was told or lose Hank forever. She sipped the champagne slowly noticing it made her feel strange as soon as she tasted it, the more she consumed the more strange she felt.' I think I have had enough.' she said trying to sit the glass down.  'Drink it all 'he instructed her as he stood over her.  Cheyenne drank the glass of wine and felt the room begin to spin.  ' I really donât feel good.' She said holding her head.  Fredrick picked her up in his arms as he kissed her on her lips he carried her to the bed where he laid her down softly and removed the robe he was wearing showing his nude masculine body. He laid next to her taking her in his arms as he began to kiss her, he rolled her on her back where he began to lick her stomach, in between her thighs as he began to pleasure her with oral sex her hips began to move as she caressed her breast, he entered her body with his hard organ. She screamed out in pain as he rammed it in her, he let out a moan. He caressed her breast while sucking on her hardened nipples, he began going in and out of her body harder each time.  ' Make love to me like a woman makes love to her man. ' He whispered in her ear, caressing her breast with his hand, as he held her thigh tightly with his other hand.  Cheyenne began to kiss him back, moving her body with his, he rolled her on top of him where he began to move her hips harder on him going deeper with in her.  ' Fuck me you bitch!' he yelled as his voice began changing.   She felt his fingerâs cutting her back like razors, Cheyenne was feeling her body respond to him in the heat of passion when she looked at his face he had changed into a demon with horns coming out of his head, but she could not stop her body from giving into him, she began to move wildly on top of him, she leaned over kissing him as she sucked on his tongue. Cheyenne was giving into the passion, she glanced at the mirror and noticed her eyes had turned to a florescent green glowing brightly. She became like an animal as they ravished each other, Cheyenne grinding her hips on him harder as she caressed her breast with one hand while with her other massaged her clit giving her another climax then falling into his arms kissing his grotesque face.  Cheyenne became like an animal as she rolled on the bed.' More master, please more.' she begged this evil demon in bed with her.  His laughter was so evil it carried through the house.  Fredrick threw her over on her stomach and rammed himself into her anal.' Ahhhh I have been longing to fuck your plump ass!' he groaned in pleasure for now he was in his true demonic state of mind as well as body.  Cheyenne screamed out in pleasure.' More master more; harder give it to me harder.â She groaned as she felt him ripping her apart, her finger nails clenched into the bed.  When he was finished with her he began to return back to his normal self.' Now you must pleasure my highest in command tonight as well my queen.' He told her as he kissed her fore head.  Otis came into the room looking at Cheyenne on the bed for his pleasure.  'What are you going to do for me?' he asked as he stood naked in front of her.  'I am going to pleasure you as you need to be.' She said sitting on the side of the bed giving him oral sex knowing he enjoyed it by his deep moans until he exploded with an orgasm.  He sat up in bed as she straddled him, he sucked on her breast, both of their eyes glowing green, Cheyenne bit his shoulder as she felt her body burning.   'Fuck me! I command you to fuck me!' she growled in a demonic tone.  He entered her body as she grinded her hips feeling such pleasures from him as she could not get enough of him , he threw her down on the bed giving it to her rougher and rougher until they exploded together.  Soon there were men and women in the bed with them as they had a wild orgy. Cheyenne and Tammy began to kiss and caress each other.' Let me pleasure you my queen.' She said as she began to kiss and lick in between Cheyenneâs thighs as she moaned caressing her breast.  'Letâs pleasure each other.' Tammy said kissing her and they pleasured each other orally.  Fredrick noticed how much his queen was enjoying her self. He grabbed her by the hair.' Drink my juices now.' He ordered her as Tammy was giving her pleasure.  After the night of the wild orgy Cheyenne hadnât any recollection of her previous life. She dressed in a long tight black dressed cut to her belly button exposing her large breast, black spiked heels her hair had turned black. Fredrick came to her the next morning.' Come we must feast.' he said leading her by the hand, her nails were black and she now belonged to the dark side.      "
"       You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings Â©  CHAPTER 1  Why do I constantly set that stupid alarm clock? Because I am a coward to take the day off. Oh by the way good morning I am Montana Jacobs and you'll be assigned to me and my partner Austin Tyler. Warning he isn't too happy that I was assigned as his partner so be prepared for some very hostile remarks towards me. Excuse my night clothes I have had this huge T - shirt since I graduated from the academy it was actually black before the thousands of washings I have given it. Ah coffee thanks you're a life saver. We wear black T - shirts, black slacks, black combat boots just in case I need to kick my way out of a situation, and a black cap that holds this dreadful long hair up. No I am not a true blond in case you're wondering. Alright I am going to go shower and dress for work and we will be on our way.  I hope I didn't keep you waiting to long, one day I hope to get issued a new car, I have had this white one for a while now. A nice little red one would be very nice. It is not a crime to dream. Anyway we are almost there; Austin is very good looking and knows it. He is divorced and has more girlfriends than Carter has Peanuts. Interested in him? Lord no, he likes him self too much for me to even like him a little. He constantly walks around combing his hair which is black and I pray every night he gets one gray hair to totally mess him up. He has great blue eyes, but wears green contacts, he runs everyday, but he is flabby. Boy he would kill me if he heard our conversation. Yeah he's pretty tall six something and thin not really flabby maybe he just has that middle age bulge that men get. How old is he? Um has to be late thirties, early forties? I will be forty two in August, and no I have never been married for a long time; only two men ever made the earth tremble under my feet.  Well we're here, you ready? Here we go, follow me. This is the lobby and that is Tommy Redding and Hannah Tooley at the information desk, they have been on the force for twenty years, anything you need to know they can answer your question. The office to your right belongs to Sheriff Conrad's and three doors down is our office. The tall blond in the sheriff's uniform is my room mate and best friend Ariana Philip. We both wear size seven tall, and have the same problem finding bathing suit tops to fit our well endowed bust. Being top heavy has its draw backs. OK here we are and hopefully he is not here yet. No luck for us today he is here waiting impatiently. I remember the first day I met him, sit down at my desk and I will tell you the story. Would you like some coffee? Great, cream and sugar? Now the story, hold on to your seat tightly.  It was a bright sunny day last summer, and I am excited to be starting a new line of police work. I report to Lieutenant Rydell's office to meet my new partner Austin Tyler his mouth dropped when he saw me and I was flattered until he used it to speak with. 'A woman! My partner is a damned woman? Why are you doing this to me?' he asked the Lieutenant.  'Calm down Austin she is very qualified and you won't get a better partner.' He told him. The Lieutenant a large man of African descent in his early fifties, his hair graying on the sides with a thick mustache and weighing two hundred fifty pounds on his six foot five frame.  'Really?' he said then tried to grab me in a head lock before I could tell him I was a four time black belt in martial arts I ended up showing him by placing him on the floor with my boot on his throat stretching his arm with my hands. He was beyond angry; it was pure contempt.  We had to go to Port Everglades in Florida the agents had been watching a certain ship and we got word that this was the day they were shipping in over a one billion dollar shipment of cocaine. The ship came out of Brazil. There were over a dozen of us when we raided the ship confiscating their large shipment of cocaine that would have hit the streets of South Florida. As we boarded the ship Austin and I were going through the ship when this huge male Brazilian decided he wasn't going peacefully, he grabbed Austin around the neck holding a gun to his temple. My heart is beating out of my chest now; I held my gun on him. 'Let my partner go or I will shoot.' I told him as beads of perspiration were forming on my top lip.  The huge giant laughed. 'Go to hell bitch and say good bye to your partner.' He yelled pulling the trigger back on his gun.  I fired shooting the man between the eyes; he fell on top of Austin knocking them both down to the ground, both laid there silently. I thought Austin was killed, he lay very still and he had a man over six feet and weighed four hundred pounds if not more on top of him.  Austin's hands clenched into two fists and he grunted in almost a whisper. 'Don't just stand there get him off of me!' Austin told me while he squinted his eyes from the man's weight on top of him.  I helped to move the large man's body off of him. Austin looked at me with so much hate I thought he was going to shoot me with his hand on his gun.  'Why did you wait so long in firing?' He yelled getting to his feet.' He was going to kill me! What are you having a hormonal imbalance and couldn't decide?' he yelled at me.  'He didn't kill you, and I had to give him a chance to drop the gun didn't I?' I asked him feeling this would be pure hell to work with him and I haven't been wrong yet.  Austin's resentment towards me didn't get any better when the other officers were congratulating me on a job well done. For the first time in my twenty years as a law enforcement officer I was actually ashamed of my ability as a woman to be able to protect my partner and wondered if he would protect me as well. I didn't want to cause a ruckus by asking to be replaced with another partner, I was a woman and I would have to prove myself.  Austin had me to do the great part of our job completing the paper work. At least I found something that he was grateful for me being his partner.... I did all the paper work, filing, and listening to his constant complaining.  I had not one bit of desire to ever marry thanks to Austin. Come to think of it I didn't even date after I began working with him.  A week later we were setting up a sting in down town Ft. Lauderdale area off of Broward Boulevard and around Sistrunk. There were five other officers with us, Austin and his fishing buddy Stan drove the truck which was air conditioned while myself, Ariana, her partner Troy, Brad and his partner Dan in the back of the rented U - Haul truck that was not air conditioned and the back door had been left unlocked so that when we heard them saying It's been a pleasure shopping with you, we would jump out of the back of the truck and make our arrest. So we were off all dressed in our black outfits, raiders in white letters across the front of our shirts. I am always nervous just before the first raid after that I am on a pure rush of adrenalin. They made the sell and we flew out of the back of the truck, two black males start running and we're in hot pursuit, we are taking hedges like hurdles in the Olympics. I past Ariana who had one guy down on the ground handcuffing him with Troy. I saw the truck coming around the bend trying to trap the other guy; I was a few feet away from him and dove through the air tackling him to the ground. He was a young kid and was putting up quite a bit of a struggle, Austin flew out of the truck along with Stan and they were able to subdue him and get the handcuffs on him. Stan helped me up off the ground.  'You got a nasty cut on your elbow; you better go have it taken care of.' Stan told me looking at my arm as he held it seeing how deep it was.  Austin laughed 'ah did wonder woman get a nasty boo boo?' he asked laughing putting the guy in the other squad car that was waiting.  I pulled my arm away.' I am fine.' I told him and went to the first aid kit I carry with me, I cleansed my arm and then wrapped it up. God it hurt so bad I wanted to cry, but I refused to let Austin see me weak.  The rest of the day my arm was throbbing, the sweat didn't help any either. I had to chase one female who decided to use my wound against me and grabbed my arm and twisted it, I saw Austin stop and watch her attacking my arm and this infuriated me that I went into my martial arts and was able to handcuff the female assailant.  Austin then approached me and the female.  'Need help wonder woman?' he asked me smugly knowing I had seen him just standing there.  'Not at all Batman.' I told him smiling walking past him with the female to the van that was waiting with six other people they were able to take down in this bust.  I sat in the back of the truck and I wanted to cry, no matter what I did he would not give me a chance. Troy looked at me and patted my shoulder.  'You going to be alright?' he asked me.  Why did he have to say those words to me? Why couldn't he just be mean to me like Austin? Tears burnt my eyes and I had to look away from him. 'I am just tired.' I told him wiping the tears away and knowing he knew I was crying because of Austin. Damn you Austin Tyler! I thought to myself.  I kept up with them and at the end of the day when we were back in the office Troy insisted on checking my arm.  Austin looked at me disgustedly. 'Women always have men waiting on them!' he said to Troy.  Troy a very good looking man age forty eight, with crystal blue eyes, he wore his brown hair in the service style cut. He was six feet and weighed one hundred ninety pounds, divorced and did not ever date unless one of the guys fixed him up.  'Lay off of her Austin.' He told him looking at him very seriously.  'Sorry if you're sucking up to her to get a piece of that ass.' Austin told him.  Troy walked inches from him.' shut the fuck up Austin!' he told him through gritted teeth.  I couldn't just stand there, so I turned and left the office walking hurriedly out of the station and running to my car where my room mate was waiting for me.  'I thought you might need a friend.' She said holding her arms out to me. I fell into her arms and cried so hard. Not only was my feelings wounded, but my arm hurt so fucking bad!  'Why does he hate me so much?' I cried when I realized Stan was watching what was happening. 'Great he'll report back to him that wonder woman cracked!' I cried even harder getting into the car. I'll meet you at the house.' I told her and pulled away driving to the emergency room to have my arm bandaged.  I received five stitches to my elbow, but the doctor couldn't stitch up my hurt feelings. I cried on the way home and was shocked to see Troy waiting outside of the house. He was talking with Ariana and her boyfriend Steve.  He opened my car door so I could get out.  'How many?' he asked me.  'Five.' I replied knowing what he meant.  'Go out with me tonight?' he asked with a little boys grin.  'I guess it would be okay.' I told him getting butterflies in my stomach.  Ariana helped me to dress for my date, she had me wear a pair of white low cut slacks, a pink tank top that showed just a small part of my stomach. I wore my hair up on my head in a tight pony tail with a pink hair scrunchie, a pair of white pearl tear drop earrings, very little make - up with my lips out lined in a dark pink with light pink lip stick. I started laughing as I looked in the mirror.  'Hell I would date me I look so good.' I said checking me out in the mirror.  'You crazy bitch your date is waiting.' She told me.  We entered the room where the two men were drinking a glass of ice tea. Troy did a double take when he saw me. I felt very sexy and good about myself tonight, not even Austin could change my mood. We went to a cozy little restaurant and we shared a pizza with a beer. We walked down two doors and played a game of pool. He killed me on the first game, it was the second game that counted and I won. He had to wash my car for a month. Troy drove me home and our good night kiss ended us in the bedroom with our tongues exploring each others mouths and he slipped my shirt off of me caressing my breast and sucking the erect nipples. He helped me out of my slacks and white thongs, and I unzipped his pants on my knees with my mouth. I helped him to step out of his pants as he pulled off his shirt and I began to massage his balls and licking his hard erection with my tongue in a slow circular motion around the head and down the shaft. He laid back on my bed and I slowly climbed up his body licking every inch of him going up, I straddled him feeling his erection entering my hot wet juices that were flowing over his erection, I massaged my breast as his hands guided my hips in a slow circular motion, the passion was growing hot with in us both, I grabbed the back of my head board with both hands as our bodies were grinding into each other harder and faster until I screamed out from the orgasm that rocked my world under every inch of me. I fell on top of him laughing and he rolled me over on my back.  'What is so funny?' he asked smiling down at me.  'You made the earth tremble.' I told him kissing his mouth softly.  We made love again for hours and fell to sleep in each others arms. It felt good to wake up and fix breakfast for someone besides myself, Ariana and Steve. We sat there eating eggs and waffles laughing over silly stuff our other room mate Sara Jordan came in, she worked the night shift so we hardly saw her unless it was on one of our days off. Sara was a tall red head with green eyes, none of us were petit little creatures, but very much toned and in shape.  She got a huge smile when she saw Troy and I together.  'Damn it I missed the house shaking last night.' She said laughing fixing her a plate to eat before going to bed.  'Well I got to go.' I said laughing at her. 'Another day of doing another sweep this one is in Pompano Beach off Martin Luther King. Again it was the same as yesterday Austin and Stan rode up front, Troy and I kept making eye contact and smiling. The first one was really strange. We went down sixteenth and men were coming up to the truck and in just a few seconds we were chasing down what seemed like the whole street. I was in pursuit of a young black male who was dressed in all black he ran behind a run down motel and as I turned the corner I came to a screeching halt, the young black male wasn't anywhere in sight, standing there waiting was a large black male with gold swirls all over his skin, he was without clothes and blew a huge flame of fire at me. I went from running forward to backwards in one instant flat.  'Woe shit! 'Was all I heard myself saying when I ran right smack into Austin almost knocking him down.  'What the fuck!' he yelled looking at this fire breathing thing coming at us. He grabbed his gun; I had mine in my hand. 'Halt or we will shoot.' He told the thing coming at us.  The thing laughed in a sound that only demons make in a scary movie, but we weren't in a movie we were in reality. It kept coming at us and we kept backing up firing, the others heard our gun shots and came to investigate, people were praying and screaming running away from this demonic monster. We were firing at it, but it kept walking towards us breathing huge flames at us and then just disappeared.  We stood there looking around, our hearts pounding so hard in our chest.  I looked around and the people were still running when the young black male came out from behind the motel all bloodied and burnt, he had fear all over his face crying for his mama. Whatever we stumbled on today was defiantly not from our world. More police units came to the scene; the Governor was flown in and kept in open line to the white house. Today our world as we once knew it was forever gone.  That night Troy and I lay in each others arms after hours of love making, our bodies wanted the other one, his kisses were hot and inviting. As soon as he placed his hand between my thighs he could feel my thick rich juices flowing, his mouth hungrily found my swollen nipples. Oh how he made the earth tremble and my body wanted more of him and I began grinding so hard on his large cock that I felt as if I would suck his entire body into me. He pinned my arms back over my head and began ramming his cock deeper into my soaked pussy that we both exploded into a orgasm that felt like it rocked the entire house.  He kissed me good night and held on to me tightly as we slept through the night. We both were scared for the first time in all of our police work we had faced something that we hadn't a clue how to fight.  Troy woke up very aroused and we made love before getting out of bed, as his body made love to mine he looked deep into my eyes.  'Will you marry me?' he asked me as his body never missed a beat in his love making.  All I could do was smile as tears were burning my eyes.  CHAPTER 2  Austin and I were at a stake out off Marina drive in Light House Point, we were watching a house for two months when tonight we got the break we had been waiting for and made a drug bust of one hundred thousand dollars in the club drug ecstasy that had been killing teenagers, we also netted a street value of ten thousand dollars in marijuana. We were on our way back in when we heard officer down come over the radio, without a word Austin and I were on our way to the scene. I knew when I saw Ariana it was Troy. I ran to where he lay struggling for air as the oxygen wasn't helping. I held him in my arms and he struggled to get something out of his pocket. It was a diamond engagement ring; he placed it on my finger before he took his last breath.  I cried out in pain. 'Troy please don't go! Please stay, don't go! I love you.... Don't go.' I cried rocking back and forth with him.  I heard Ariana telling Austin that thing attacked them; he never had a chance it was on him before he could pull his gun. The monster had struck again two streets from the first time it appeared.  Austin helped me up and held me in his arms for the first time he showed a tender side about him. Austin took me and Ariana home, Sara was waiting for us when we arrived. I looked at Austin as my eyes filled like a lake with tears.  'Austin I never got to tell him I am pregnant. He doesn't know we were going to have a child.' I cried into his arms.  'We'll work through this, I promise Montana.' He told me holding me close.  For the first time in our relationship he treated me as a human being and he showed me he does have feelings and he can care. I would continue working as long as I was not showing and then Austin would have me at the desk so the child would not be harmed. I actually think he was excited about the birth. One day when I was home turning the den into a nursery he brought over footballs, base ball bats, airplanes he hung from the ceiling and the cutest Miami dolphins warm up suit for the baby he named Ricky to wear home in.  It was nice having a man around during my pregnancy. When I was six months pregnant I was working in the office doing all the paper work when I heard a loud commotion in the hall way. I stuck my head out the door and there was the monster thing that killed Troy. He saw me and kept throwing people all over making his way towards me. I quickly slammed the door, my heart was beating hard, and all I could think about was protecting my child. I was crying trying to open the window so I could escape, but it was stuck and wouldn't open. I heard the office door being smashed behind me, I heard gun fire and I prayed to God for help. He was in the office with me, I turned and saw him charging at me and then a sparkling mist appeared in front of me and it was Troy, the two battled until Troy hit him with a lightening bolt blowing him up.  'Troy....How are you here?' I asked him crying and touching his face.  'I took a better job lets say.' He told me kissing my forehead. 'You and I will be together one day, just now is not our time. Take care of our child, baby I will always be near when you need me.' He told me and vanished into the white sparking mist.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings Â© Austin could not believe what he had just witnessed. He hung his head down as tears ran down his face. 'Montana I am sorry for how I treated you before.' He told me.  'I never took you seriously Austin so don't worry about it.' I told him feeling very sad for him.  He was looking down at the ground. 'I am sorry I made you cry the day you cut your arm.' He told me walking to me and taking me in his arms holding me.  Stan did tell him and he kept it to him self. What happened the day I lost Troy between Austin and I kept growing deeper.  At nine months I was so huge, and Austin didn't help any with the ice cream and pickles he kept stuffing me with. As I walked he would sing wibbles wobbles but they don't fall down. It was a great day to go into labor; I was at the filing cabinet when suddenly my water broke.  'Austin, it's time.' I said holding my stomach.  'Oh no you peed your pants!' he said with a strange look on his face.  I couldn't help but to laugh.' No my water broke silly and the baby is starting to push his way out.' I told him holding my stomach bent over.  'Oh shit, what do I do?' he asked running over to me.  'We need to lay me down he's coming out.' I told him feeling the contractions coming one after the other.  'Squeeze your legs together you have to get to the hospital.' He told me trying to get me to walk out of the office.  'No I can't.' I told him going down to the ground.  Austin began calling for help and the chief, Ariana and Hannah came running into the office.  'Oh, oh we have a baby coming out!' she said pulling my pants off.  Ariana and Hannah delivered my little boy Ricky. He weighed ten pounds six ounces and had black hair. I kept him in my hospital room with me when I saw the sparkling mist appear by his bed. Troy picked our son up in his arms smiling down at him.  'You must protect him for great things are coming his way.' He told me holding our son. He laid him in his bed and vanished.  'Troy.......'I said softly sitting in my hospital bed.  I couldn't sleep that night so I decided to take a walk to look at the other babies and I found Austin at my door a sleep in a chair on the other side of the door.  'Austin come in here.' I told him. 'What are you doing here?' I asked him.  'I wanted to be near the baby and ....You.' he told me looking down at the floor.  He took my hand in his hand and kissed me softly on my lips. 'I want us to be a family.' He said holding me in his arms. 'Marry me.' He told me.  I was totally shocked and I saw Troy standing behind him smiling and nodding for me to say yes. 'Yes Austin I will marry you.' I told him and he held me tightly.  Austin put him self on the birth certificate as the father. We were married eight weeks later. Ariana and Sara watched the baby while we were on our honeymoon in Disney world.  Life was different being married to Austin he moved us into his house in Davie, Florida. I was not happy knowing that when I went back to work I had been moved to a different unit and a new partner. I had become accustom to Austin's moodiness which is good because it will help in our marriage.  I had come home early one day from work, it was Austin's birthday and I had invited our friends from work. I ordered a female stripper who weighed close to three hundred and fifty pounds; she was blond and wore more make up than Tammy Faye Baker. I slipped into a white halter dress with the back cut just above my buttocks making my white lacy thong seen just above the dress over my hips. The front had a diamond shape hole cut from in between my breast to just below my navel. I wore my hair up on my head with white dangling earrings, and a pair of white sandals.  I had catered in a smoked turkey meal and the birthday cake held his stripper. We sat out by the pool as everyone mingled around eating and drinking. I hired a local band to play old time rock for the party and hired an Elvis Impersonator for the final finale. Everyone was singing and dancing, thank God everyone had a designated driver for those who were drinking. Austin slow danced with me holding me tightly to his body, I felt attracted to him tonight, I mean sexually attracted to him to him. He kissed me softly on my neck, running his hands up and down my back. I found myself becoming moist and my nipples were hard and erect. Austin danced me to behind some bushes away from the party and began to kiss me passionately as I returned just as hot and passionate kisses to him.  He ran his hands over my breast and sat down on the air conditioning unit that was hid inside of the bushes. He released his erection from with in his pants and raised my dress up removing my thongs. I straddled him taking him deep with in my hot juices and moving our bodies in a slow grind as he held my thongs to his face taking in the sweet smell of me into his nostrils, we both came in a hot and passionate orgasm that made me weak in my knees. We pulled ourselves together and joined the party as if we had never just made love only two feet from where everyone was having a good time. Austin was sat in the middle of the room for his cake and presents, he was amazed at the size of the cake thinking the guys did it with some sexy babe in the cake. He tried to run away when the stripper came out of the cake, two of his co workers held him so he could not escape the very large stripper that had trapped him putting red lips all over his face.  After the party was over we sat out by the pool, I stood up letting my dress fall to the ground followed by my thong and stepped into the pool, he followed me into the water nude, I wrapped my arms and legs around him licking his lips softly with my tongue, I began licking his chest and then under the water licking his hard erection and caressing his balls. I would come up for air ever so often causing him to grab me and kissing me passionately running his hands all over my body, he could no longer stand the desire to release his fluids deep inside of my own hot juices, he grabbed me and entered me from behind, caressing my breast and massaging my clit as he grounded his hips harder making his erection to go deeper with in my hot wet juices as my arms were wrapped behind his neck as he ravished my body and massaging my swollen clit as my body began to tremble from the orgasm that racked mine and his body.  That night we came to the realization that we had fallen in love with each other and I slept in his arms feeling so safe and secure. It's not everyday you find true love, but I had been graced with two true loves.  I had been transferred to the plain clothes division, I finally got issued a new car too, a gold Ford Taurus, no not my little red car I had been hoping for. We were going to go investigate a shooting at a neighborhood store off Dixie Highway in Ft. Lauderdale. A man was shot to death in his car by a rival gang for being at the right place at the wrong time. He was caught up by stray bullets being fired at the other passing car when a deadly bullet hit him in the temple killing him instantly.  My partner Rachel Smyth and I were questioning witnesses just as one of the suspect's car drove by and was spotted by one of our witnesses. Rachel a young woman age twenty - six, with light brown long hair, brown eyes, tall and toned we proceeded to give chase while we left the other squad car behind to secure any evidence that might be found by the crime scene unit.  The light blue Toyota spotted us and began speeding down the road and through red lights, Rachel radioed for help in securing the speeding car. We followed the car into a near by alley when the suspects car came to a sudden stop. We looked at each other wondering why they had stopped; Rachel kept in radio contact with the dispatcher Misty. We noticed a blue light glowing inside the car and both men vanished and my heart skipped a beat, we looked around to see if we could see them when both men appeared on each side of the car beating on the window, without hesitation I threw the car in reverse while we both screamed at the top of our lungs. Both men looked like demons; they were red with horns and fangs. I did not stop until I hit the pavement of the road leading to the alley and turned my car and we headed out of there when we heard pounding on the top of the car and the roof began to cave in.  'Oh shit their on the fucking car!' I yelled slamming on the brakes and watched the two creatures go flying in the air, but they never hit the ground they just vanished.  'Where are they?' Rachel asked looking around not realizing the radio had been static and just now we had a clear reception. We heard the dispatcher Misty trying to get us to respond.  Finally we saw the other police cars coming and I was relieved. I opened my car door slowly making sure it was the police and then stepped out when I felt a searing burning sensation in my neck. I watched my head leave my body as the creatures had decapitated me. I saw my body hit the ground but I was standing beside the car still when I turned and blew the creatures into oblivion with one swipe of my hands. Rachel was screaming seeing the attack on my body. I entered into a new form of life and then I saw Troy. We were dead, together now just dead though.  'What happen?' I asked him as he walked to me.  'We are Guardian police now.' He told me.' Come on I will explain it all to you.' He told me taking my hand and we left in the white sparkling mist.  We went to a beautiful place that had colorful butterflies floating around, a beautiful water fall and fairy's floating around sprinkling gold dust around.  'We both were killed by demonic creatures of the dark side also known as evil, hell and so forth. Since we fought against evil in our life we were chosen to be special kind of police here. There are a lot of us here.' He said holding my hand.  'What about Ricky?' I asked feeling sad having to leave him.  'Austin will be there for him.' He told me gently.  'Austin...' I whispered his name thinking how this would effect him, we had just found our love and now we have to let go. 'It's not fair.' I said feeling remorse for my heart ached for Austin.  Austin sat in our living room as Ariana and Rachel broke the news to him about my death. He sat quietly, not making a sound and then looked at our picture of our wedding day. 'Well I have to go to work. 'He told them handing Ariana Ricky.  He walked out of the house and then dropped to his knees crying, the women stood in the door watching him and feeling helpless to help in his time of sorrow. I knelt before him wiping away his tears.  'Don't mourn me Austin; we will meet again one day.' I told him kissing him softly on his lips and vanishing.  Austin looked up at the sky crying. 'No! Not Montana!' he cried out in pain.  My sister's Natasha and Jessica came to stay with Austin to help him to get through the funeral.  I was given a new assignment to go back to the force only as someone else since I was decapitated I couldn't very well go back as myself. I returned as Koko Bear full blooded Native American and my police dog which happened to be Troy my faithful wolf Anoki. Anoki was a white wolf with blue eyes and I was a twenty six year old single female fresh out of the academy and off the reservation and Austin who was bitterer then before was assigned to me. My luck right? The first day with Austin was just horrible he yelled at me and Anoki who would cover his eyes in the back seat with his paws as Austin ranted and raved.  'I must have baby sitter wrote all over me for me to get stuck with all the partners fresh out of diapers!' he yelled at me.  I had enough of his big mouth. 'First of all gramps, I am not happy being stuck with the geriatrics ward! I am quite capable of protecting myself and your tired white ass, as far as Anoki who is my real partner he is not a mutt, but a wolf so learn the difference!' I yelled at him.  'You fucking spoiled little brat do not speak to me in that manner!' he yelled turning all red in his face with his eyes bulging as well as his veins.  I could not resist I stuck my thumbs in my ears waving my fingers at him and stuck out my tongue.  He looked at me so seriously after coming to a complete stop at a red light. 'Just go the rest of the day without so much a word to me Detective Bear.' He told me angrily for he didn't want to show he had feelings too.  'Fine Detective grumpy.' I said smiling.  'Neener, neener.' He said sticking his fingers in his ears and his tongue out at me.  Anoki had his paws over his eyes as if he was embarrassed to be seen with them.  CHAPTER THREE  There were a couple of demons who had come into the police force and they were keeping their drug rings from being busted along with their houses of prostitution. It did not just end with the police; Judges as well as Senators had been invaded with the Dark side's army. As I was going into the gym to work out with Anoki by my side I over heard an argument between a male uniform police officer and a female detective.  'Look Roy we had a deal, unless you want that pretty little seventeen year old hottie working in the house you will stick to our bargain.' She told him smugly.  'Why don't you tell us about the deal Roy?' I asked stepping out of the darkness so they could see me.  'You just made a mistake Koko.' She told me.  'No Detective Satinni you did.' I told her blowing her up with one swipe of my hand when her eyes glowed red.  'Jesus Christ what are you?' he asked petrified of us.  'No not Jesus Christ, but we're on the same side as he is though.' I told him smiling.  I took him back to my office while Austin was talking to the new female dispatcher and I felt a pang of jealousy that he was taking her out tonight. Who is watching Ricky? I thought to myself. I tried to push my feelings to the side, but Troy even picked up on them sitting his paw on my knee whimpering as if to comfort me. Roy told me everything he knew, he gave me names of the ones who were in charge and the names of the ones who were being forced to participate in the illegal activities. Anoki and I left without a word to Austin and we went to Sergeant Briggs house. He opened the door with a surprise look on his face.  'Koko what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? He asked me.  'Oh lets just say I know what you are.' I told him with a smirk on my face.  Anoki had turned into Troy when we walked into the house and Sergeant Briggs turned into a demon with hoofs for feet, horns and a face like a Billy goat. We were able to destroy him by hitting him with double electrical balls causing him to explode. When we left the house heading to the next home of our Chief. He opened the door expecting us as well were the other demons waiting with him.  'Didn't you two learn the first time?' he asked throwing daggers at us. Anoki had turned into Troy and I caught the dagger with my hand.  'Didn't you learn how to throw in demon school Chief?' I asked him sending a huge fire ball at his aid Samantha and blowing her up.  'Impressive for a beginner.' He said throwing a lightening bolt at me when I heard Austin yelling and Ricky crying.  'You hurt either one of them and I will do worse then send you back to hell!' I told him searching the house with my eyes, listening closely to try to pin point exactly where they were in the house when I found them in an upstairs room I vanished leaving everyone down stairs to save my family. Austin's eyes grew wide when appeared out of the white sparkling mist blowing up the demon bitch he had made a date with. She used their date to lure him and Ricky here. I turned when I felt a burning sensation in my arm; I had been hit with an electrical ball by a demon on the other side of the room.  'Shit I just bought this shirt asshole!' I told the short fat repugnant man and blew him up. 'Take my hand.' I told him grabbing Ricky and taking them to safety out side of the house and then I went back to help Troy to get rid of the rest of the house full of demons. When we emerged out of the house and Austin and Ricky were waiting for us.  'Troy, how?' he asked him looking at me.  'Austin we were sent back to fight evil here.' He told him.  Austin turned to me,'Thank you for saving us.' He told me not realizing who I was.  'Austin, its Montana.' Troy told him.  Austin looked at me with tears forming in his eyes.' God, I miss you baby.' He said crying biting his bottom lip as it quivered.  I had tears fill my eyes.' My sweet, sweet love I have missed you and Ricky.' I told him wrapping my arms around him. Troy held his son while I comforted Austin.  Austin pulled him self together and Troy changed back to Anoki and we rode back to the house.  I walked around straightening it up and he begged us to stay at the house while we were here. We agreed and during the time Troy would be him self unless we had visitors and then he would turn back into Anoki. The three of us slept in our king size bed. Troy excused himself on the second night leaving Austin and I alone in the bed.  'Montana can you look like you use to look?' he asked me running his fingers along my face so softly.  I turned back into Montana and his eyes swelled up with tears as he cried taking me into his arms, he cried so hard with every fiber in his body, his lips searched for mine, his hands roamed my body as they had so many time before, he touched between my thighs finding the wet hot juices welcoming his fingers to explore even more deeper, he raised his body on top of mine kissing my breast and sucking my hardened erect nipples, our moans mingled together, he grinded deeper and harder inside of me until we exploded into an explosive orgasm. I lay in his arms giggling.  'What are you laughing about?' he asked me.  'You are so good in bed that you made a dead girl come in a heat of passion.' I said laughing.  'I better stay out of the grave yards then.' He said teasingly. 'I don't want you to leave me again Montana.' He said holding me tightly.  'I wish I didn't have to go, but one day they will call me home.' I told him.  The next couple of weeks were really great being with Austin and Ricky. Troy had so much fun with our son. It was touching watching them play together.  We were investigating a rash of murders that involved oriental females of all ages. The victims were raped, burnt with cigarettes all over their bodies; they were then decapitated holding their heads in between their legs to give the effect of giving them self's oral sex. I hated this case and the way the perpetrator humiliated the victims in such a degrading manner. As Austin, Anoki and I walked through the crime scene of the third victim an eighty year old grandmother, had been brutally raped, and savagely tortured before he killed her.  'I want this sick son of a bitch!' I told Austin with tears forming in my eyes.  'I think we all are in agreement we have to catch this asshole.' Austin said as the crime scene was gathering the evidence.  Anoki began growling, his hair stood up on his back and he walked slowly towards the closet door. I felt as if I had stopped breathing as I walked to the closet and slowly opened the door to find a twenty year old oriental woman crouched down crying. I was shocked to see her in there especially alive. I took her hand in mine and that was when I saw a vision of the demon that was killing these women. He was standing behind me collecting evidence, Austin was asking me what I saw when he looked up from the victim with red glowing eyes and I instinctively hit him with a flaming ball of fire that missed him. Anoki was gliding through the air landing on top of him as Troy. They battled each other rolling around the floor when the demon known as Detective Miller pulled out a large dagger to sever Troy's throat when I hit his hand with a lightening bolt causing the dagger to go flying across the room. With one swipe of my hand I hit him with a huge lightening ball in his face causing half of his face to burn. He fell off of Troy holding his burning face when I severed his head with one swipe of my hand. I looked at Austin as he and the other officers watched me not saying a word as if they were afraid of upsetting me even more.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings Â© 'Sorry decapitation is a sensitive issue with me. Any memory of what was witnessed will be wiped away from their memories as soon as we leave.' I told Austin calming down a little.  We would sit under the tree at the house that was near the man made pond watching the sun set it was so peaceful. Anoki sat by Ricky in his infant swing cooing and laughing at Anoki as if he knew it was really his father. We looked like the perfect happy family sitting together and laughing. Anoki would even get Austin to play Frisbee with him. It was not quite the same as when Troy and Austin played on the beach two years ago trying to impress all the younger women. I watched them playing and the sound of Ricky cooing at the two playing warmed my heart.  The next few weeks were actually calm; I kept dreading that they were going to be calling us home any time because of it being so peaceful.  I should have known it would not have been quiet for long, we were sent to Tallahassee our Governor it seems made a pack with the devil to be elected president for the next eight years and the Dark side could have his soul willingly. We walked through the halls of the Governors home it was immaculate and huge; everything was white right down to the leather furniture and the white marble floor. Well Gov. Brown you have done quite well stealing the tax payer's money. I whispered to myself. The governor was in his bedroom on the bed with the young Spanish maid dressed in the black and white maid's uniform.  'Now that is what I call really serving our Governor.' I said loudly startling the two lovers.  The Governor lost his interest in his bed partner and became interested in his uninvited guest.  'Who are you?' he asked raising off the bed putting him self back in his pants.  'Where is Mrs. Gov.?' I asked being a smart ass.  He rang for security on his burglar button, but I had disabled it before barging into the room.  'They won't be coming to save you because I killed the security system, but it will start working as soon as I am done with your miserable ass.' I told him walking up to him and pushing him on the bed.  'You're going to regret this attack on me because I have very powerful associates that will protect me.' He yelled as Anoki growled at him.  'I know and you tell Michael that my boss canceled your contract for President and Michael still gets your soul.' I told him when his eyes began to glow red.  His body began to change into a hideous beast.' You will die!' he yelled in a demonic voice.  I smiled at him and began singing the theme song to Cops blowing him up with my powers. Bad boy whatcha gonna do?' I said with a smile and I looked at the frighten maid.  'Go do your work and pray for your sin of adultery.' I told her.  Anoki and I vanished into a white sparkling mist and back in the office with Austin who was putting together a two story log cabin with tooth picks when we appeared scaring him and causing him to knock half of his cabin down.  'Oops sorry Austin.' I said trying not to smile.  'I wish you could knock before appearing it would help to reduce the risk of a heart attack taking place.' He said holding his heart.  I tried to remain composed, but I really wanted to burst out laughing. 'I am so sorry Austin.' I told him as I walked over to him kissing him on his forehead not realizing that Ariana was watching us.  'Gee Austin, Montana hasn't been dead that long and you're already getting a new girlfriend to replace her.' Ariana told him as tears filled her eyes.  'Ariana wait, you and I were best friends.' I told her without thinking.  'You're crazy, I was his wife's best friend I hardly know you.' She told me looking at me as if I were the plague.  I had already opened the can of beans so I might as well finish the meal.' I am Montana.' I told her turning into myself when I made sure no one else saw me.  She stood still with tears flowing over the brim of her eyes.' Montana.' She whispered and fell into my arms.  Anoki became Troy and the three of us stood there hugging. 'Oh how I have missed you two.' she told us. 'How did you come back? That was a stupid question, the good guys sent you back.' She said smiling through her tears.  'I have missed you so much Ariana! Come for dinner tonight.' I told her as we both were now crying.  We ate dinner that night talking and laughing, even Troy had joined us at the table. Ariana ended up spending the night in the spare room and her and Troy sat up most of the night going down memory lane of all the cases they did together. The next morning we cooked our regular breakfast of waffles and eggs making Sara come by for breakfast. She took the news like Ariana, but it felt so right that the old room mates were back together again.  Tommy was sitting at the desk when he over heard two detectives from vice discussing who was going to pick up their Thursday pay from the strip joint on Martin Luther King Boulevard. He came to Austin and myself telling us what he had over heard. We decided to go check it out. I changed into a ravishing red head with green cat eyes, the body that everyman wanted his wife to have a tight body with a flat belly and great boobs. Austin looked at me smiling; I slapped him on his chest with the back of my hand.  'Forget those thoughts if you want to keep body parts attached to your body.' I told him then pinched his cheek lightly.  'Its not really like being with another woman Montana it would still be you, like its you when your Koko.' He told me when he saw he was not making a sale on this subject. 'I guess it's not a good idea.' He said watching my ass as I began to get out of the van to go across the street. 'I will be here thinking of you.' He said imagining me on top of him seducing him.  I was hired and would start that night, it was explained about the champagne room, and that if I was caught having sex with a customer it would lead to my being dismissed. I realized why I was not shown the room when two dancers came out with a large bald man high on cocaine. One of the girls handed the large fat man with blond greasy hair, blue jeans and a white shirt that I was talking to five hundred dollars.  'Good job girls.' He told the naked women walking pass him with their very satisfied customer who was looking me over in my black low cut wide legged pants, with a hot pink half shirt that exposed my pink lacy bra with matching thongs that could be seen just at the top of the slacks and a pair of pink opened toe six inch spiked heels. I smiled at him and purposely showed the tip of my tongue very slowly wetting my bottom lip. That night I wore white low cut slacks just above my pelvic, a white sheer shirt with a white lacy bra and matching thong with white sandals. I walked into the place seeing the large man sitting there watching the door, his eyes lit up when he saw me and came up to me without waiting.  'I want a private dance with you in the room.' He said undressing me with his eyes.  'Ok hon. I will be right with you.' I told him going into the dressing room changing into a short red leather skirt just below my ass, a red leather bra and matching thongs, a red half top and I walked out to him in my six inch spiked heels. He followed me to the room, he sat at the chair at the round table built around the table where I began to bump and grind my ass, tits and pussy inches from his face. I saw his hand rubbing his erection and I removed my top slowly teasing him with my provocative movements rubbing my hands over my body slowly, removing my bra and tossing it behind me. He was rubbing his erection even harder, I turned my back to him and began removing my shirt and moving my hips in a circular motion, I bent over and looking at him between my legs while running my hand slowly over my crotch, I then stood up removing my thong and throwing them at him that he caught smiling up at me, I slowly brought myself down on the stage massaging my breast and let my hand go down my stomach slowly until I was at the tip of my pelvic and turned my body so my crotch inches from him and I began to masturbate as he masturbated, my fingers slowly and sensually massaged my clit that was becoming swollen and wet, my fingers were gliding smoother from the hot juices that were seeping from me, my hips were moving in slow circular grinding motions and before I realized it I was caught up in the dark seduction taking place and felt the man orally pleasuring me, my hips began to arch up towards his face, my hands caressed my hardened nipples, I bit my bottom lip from the pleasure he was giving my body with his tongue slowly licking my sticky sweet hot juices. I felt him entering my body, I wanted him, I could not understand what was happening to me it was if this man was consuming me entirely. I was moaning from deep with in me and I came in such a hot passionate orgasm. He exploded his juices deep with in me and I heard him laughing in my ear and then I saw his glowing eyes and knew I had been seduced by a demon with out realizing it. He was still in me and began kissing me, I returned his kisses hungrily as his hand were caressing my breast; he began to move his hips causing himself to become erect again. He rolled me on top of him and I moved slowly in a circular motion gradually moving slowly then working my hips faster and faster until we were like animals mating and he turned into his demonic self ravishing me until he heard my cries from the orgasm racking my body over and over. I couldn't resist him and it was as if he were draining my very life from me and he was gaining strength from me.  'Not much longer my good little warrior and I will have all of your powers as well as your life. Turn over so I can feed my appetite with you.' He ordered me.  I obeyed and propped myself up so he could enter me doggy style. He was so huge and because he was becoming more evil each time we had sex his penis was actually so cold it burnt me, but I wanted more, and as he dug his fingers into my hips thrashing me with his hard erection harder and harder his breath was so hot it actually felt cold blowing down on my bare ass. I began to massage my clit and moaned from the pleasure he was giving me when I collapsed from the last orgasm. When I had awakened I was in the van with Troy leaning over me.  'Where is my Master Thomas?' I asked as my eyes were almost coal black and I longed for his touch.  'Montana he is gone, I destroyed him to save your life.' He told me holding a wet cloth on my forehead.  I became crazed in the van throwing Troy to the front of the van with Austin who looked so confused. I was screaming like a crazed person and what was worse I felt my soul burning. Troy looked at me and then pounced on top of me and we vanished in a white sparkling mist.  Chapter 4  I was strapped down to a silver table that was cold to my bare flesh, there were bright lights over me and people in long white robes with long white beards looked down on me chanting the same words over and over and moving their hands over my body in the same way and motion. Suddenly I became violently ill throwing up purple green slime that bubbled onto the ground and then I became suddenly cold and blacked out again. When I awakened I was in a pure white room with a white gown and covers on me, there was a white sparkling fog that floated around the room when a man in a long white robe and long white hair and beard took my hand.  'Welcome back Montana.' He said holding my hand.  'Welcome back....... I have been somewhere?' I asked feeling slightly disorientated.  'Yes you were trapped with in the dark side for a short time.' He told me smiling so kindly I did not want to leave for I felt so safe and at peace.  'I love it here it is so peaceful.' I told him.  'Well your well now and its time to return to your family.' He told me and the next thing I knew I was standing in my bathroom getting out of the shower when Austin came walking in.  'Almost ready to go baby?' he asked me kissing me.  'yes.' I said looking at myself as Koko in the mirror.  I dressed while Anoki and Ariana were in the kitchen waiting for us to leave. Seven detectives tied to the club and being paid money to protect them against being busted plus a percentage on the prostitution.  Austin kept me in the car with him while Ariana was the one under cover this time. We raided the place after three months of gathering strong evidence against all seven detectives, the club owners as well were looking at some long prison sentences for conspiracy of prostitution and drugs with the intent to purchase and sell.  Troy and Ariana were spending a lot of time together, laughing and talking until in the early morning hours, I looked at Ariana smiling.  'So is there a romance blooming between my two favorite people?' I asked sipping on my morning coffee.  'Would you be bothered by it?' she asked me.  'No Ariana I am married to Austin even if I am dead I will always be his wife. I love Troy he is Ricky's father and my best friend, but my heart is branded deeply by Austin.' I told her sipping my coffee.  'Good because I find him so damned hot now, I can't stop thinking about him. Last night he kissed me and I swear I saw stars when he kissed me.' She said her smile was so bright.  Well I guess I will go get Austin up so we are not late.' I told her.  'Koko do you get hungry or thirsty?' she asked me looking curiously at me.  'No we don't, we just go through the motions so that no one feels strange sitting with dead people.' I told her smiling.  I went to our bedroom and sat beside Austin watching him sleep when he opened one eye. He smiled taking my hand under the covers placing it in his pajama bottoms on his erection.  'I need to be fed and he wants you for breakfast.' He said pulling me under the covers.  We were laughing and making love to each other before he had to get up. He loves to make love in the mornings when he first wakes up. I love feeling him searching my body with his hands, feeling his lips on my neck and sucking on my hardened erect nipples until I cry out from the orgasms he gives my body.  Anoki and I were materialized in Washington D.C. unfortunately their landing was off and they sat us in the president's rest room being used by the President, yes the President of the USA. He did not find it amusing since he was in his birthday suit, he would never have won Presidency if the American people saw that body! He screamed, we screamed and a hundred and twenty pound Shepard is not a great screamer either, Anoki sounded like a poodle. The reason why we were there we soon found out was that the vice president had been replaced by a demon and he was going to kill the president this morning while he bathed so he could take over the government.  We now have surprised the vice president who had a hypodermic filled with a liquid pain killer that the president is very much allergic too and would be dead in ten minutes after the injection. The vice President was caught by us and destroyed before he could carry his plan out, the vice president has not been found or heard from and he is still listed as MIA. Anoki and I walked into a park in Washington I petted his head.  'We need to talk Troy.' I told him sitting on the park bench.  Anoki jumped up on the bench next to me turning into Troy. 'What is wrong?' He asked me looking so sweet.  'I know about you and Ariana and I am cool with it.' I told him taking his hand.  'That's really sweet of you to be ok with it.' He said he was very agitated with me at the moment.  'I thought that when you died you would be back in my arms, but no good old Austin has you and I personally am not cool with that.' He told me looking so angry.  'He's my husband! I love him and I will not apologize to you or anyone else for giving him my heart.' I told him with tears stinging my eyes.  Troy looked at me. 'I remember a time I was supposed to have been your husband and you loved me.' He said bending over looking at the ground rubbing his hands together.  'If it was you in Austin's place, would you want him taking your wife even though death had already claimed her?' I asked him seeing.  'I think the dead should be with the dead and the live ones with the live ones.' He told me vanishing into a white sparkling mist.  'Damn you!' I whispered to myself and left.  Michael the leader of the dark side stood silently watching us argue and leave Washington separately. He smiled vanishing into a black sparkling mist.  I was fuming when I got back to the house and Anoki sat on the couch with his paws covering his eyes. I stormed past him going to my bedroom when I had just had enough. I sat on the bed crying, Anoki came slowly into the room not knowing what to do.  'When you died I didn't know what to do, I was lost without you and pregnant, and Austin helped me. You told me to marry him, and now you condemn me for loving him.' I told him crying. I felt his head on my shoulder. He was whimpering like a puppy. And I couldn't help but to laugh at him.  Troy sat next to me but not as Anoki and licked my face. He burst into laughter from the expression of pure disgust.  'Oh gross you licked my face!' I told him wiping my face off with his shirt tail when Austin walked in and turned back around walking out of the room going into the bathroom in the hall.  'Austin wait!' I yelled jumping to my feet to run after him. I knocked on the door and he did not answer me. I then vanished appearing on the other side but he was gone. I looked around the bathroom but he was gone! I then saw the bathroom window open and I saw him walking towards the road. 'Damn it!' I said and vanishing again this time appearing next to him.  'I am sorry I didn't knock going into our bedroom. I am sorry if I interrupted anything.' He said walking faster down the street.  'You didn't I was wiping his spit off my face with his shirt cause he licked me trying to be cute.' I tried to explain to him.  'I don't need you to explain to me.' He said not looking at me but walking even faster when Anoki came charging at him and knocked him down turning into Troy.  'I don't know why your mad I am the one that made the ass out of myself by blowing up at her for being in love and faithful to you even in death.' He said pinning him down on the ground.  Austin looked at me with Troy sitting on top of him. 'Really?' he asked him smiling at me.  Troy looked at him. 'Really, now don't make me drag you back to the house.' He told him smiling. 'I am sorry Montana for being a jerk.' He said smiling and helping Austin up off the ground.  'It's ok Troy I am just use to Austin being the jerk and not you.' I said smiling at Austin.  'Hey I resent that because I am only a part time jerk.' Austin said with a smile.  We were given the task of catching a serial killer whose victims are young eighteen twenty year old females with brown wavy hair to their shoulders and all were wearing dark blue sweat suits with white stripes on the side of the legs and a white tank top with a matching dark blue sweater wrapped around their hips. It was if the serial killer kept killing the same victim over and over because the girls were all so close in resemblance. We had one clue to work with the girls were almost clones in looks and style of dress. We used Anoki to pick up the serial killers scent, we worked the case almost twenty four seven sleeping only when Austin's body was becoming tired and worn from the long days, but I had to catch this guy he haunted my waking consciousness I could see him except for his face. It started on the first case I was walking around the crime scene when I saw him almost in a vision that played before me. I watched him following the victim when she exited the city bus and she walked quickly down the side walk scared to look back at the approaching foot steps that began running when she did. She turned the corner quickly catching a quick glimpse of her assailant he was dressed similar to her except his hood on his jacket was up over his head blocking his face. She screamed and he tackled her on the lonely dark side walk and dragged her behind the shopping center holding her mouth so she could not scream when he knocked her out and carried her to a cubby hole behind the stores and taped her mouth shut with the duct tape in his jacket pocket. He had removed her clothes before she came conscious finding him on top of her raping her. She tried screaming and began to cry. And I heard him call out Wendy before he killed her by strangulation during the attack on her. After she was dead he began beating her corpse blaming her for him killing her that she should have been a good girl and not a bad girl. I now knew the first victim was named Wendy, I had her age range now I would have to check the missing person files and other cases files to see if I could track down our first victim. I spent most of the nights with Troy going over cold case files while Austin slept in our bed. I turned my appearance into the description of the murdered women and began riding the bus transit hoping to catch our killer. For three weeks I rode from one end of Broward County to the other end. I knew all the routes and drivers by the end of the last week when our boy found me.  You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings Â© 'Wendy I warned you to stay off this bus and away from that driver.' A mans voice whispered behind me.  'I am not Wendy.' I told him trying to see his face but the hood and dark sun glasses kept me from seeing his face,  I exited the bus and he was right behind me, I walked faster and so did he, I began to run and so did he and then he tackled me to the ground.  'I am sick of having to constantly punish you for not staying home and being my good little girl! I only married your mommy to get to you now go to sleep so I can play.' He said hitting me as hard as he could with his fist.  'Not this time scum sucker!' I told him throwing him off of me and on to his back on the side walk. People were walking by and not wanting to be involved just looking the other way.  Troy and Austin grabbed him by each arm pulling him up to his feet and removing the duct tape from his pocket. We had him and took him into the station; I had not changed my appearance in the car when he began talking to me from the back seat.  'Why didn't you stay dead? I killed you so many times replaying that horrible night over and over. I thought they would find where I hid you the first time but your still there in the attic where I put you that night I dragged you inside when you were letting that boy feel all over your body. You will always belong to me!' he said sounding so crazy in the back seat.  I turned smiling at him. 'No I belong to God now.' I told him and returned to looking like Koko.  'Wendy come back!' he cried sounding as if he were in agony.  I assumed that by turning into Koko broke the obsession that she lived in his sick mind. We had to investigate an eighty year old woman on suspicion of murdering a young mother and the woman's mother over the elderly woman's obsession with the eighteen month old child. Her name is Ruby Thomas and she took into her home an expectant mother named Liza and Liza's mother Judy who were homeless. At first everything was all cozy inside the home. The elderly Ruby made them feel like family until the birth of Jaime on Easter morning. A week after the birth Ruby began screaming at the young mother and forcing the child out of the mother's arms. As the child grew older Ruby became more obsessed with the child not allowing the grand mother Judy or Liza to take the child for walks. She would fight with the two women if they tried to feed the child anything but cookies and doughnuts. The young mother called the woman's daughter telling her of her concern. The daughter Brandy came over one day to observe what was being said and noticed her mother's strange obsession and how she became combative over the child even with her daughter Brandy throwing her out of the house and forbidding her to ever step foot on her property.  Two weeks had gone by when Brandy called her mother and she could hear the child in the back ground crying.  'Where are her mother and grand mother mom?' Brandy asked.  'Oh they took off.' Her mother told her.  'Well I hear the baby crying.' She told her mother.  'Yes they gave me the child for rent for staying here.' She told Brandy.  Brandy hung up the phone knowing her mother was lying to her and went to check it out her self. Brandy parked her car down the street and walked up to the house and looked into the windows of the bedroom of the two women. She saw the women lying motionless, she tapped on the window and still they did not responded. Brandy grabbed her cell phone and called the police. She was shaking when we got there. When we finally got into the house we found the women had been stabbed repeatedly in their sleep. The coroner confirmed they had been drugged and once they were passed out from the drugs of Ruby's prescription sleeping pills, Ruby began her murderous rage to rid her self of any other persons getting in between her and the child who now lives in Northern Florida with a loving family on a farm.  I had dinner plans with Austin while Troy and Ariana were to watch Ricky. I began to pace the floor for he had not returned from the corner store where he went to get milk for Ricky. Two hours had past when he finally walked in the door. I looked at him and I could sense something had happened to him. Troy felt it to and was the first to be by his side.  'I need someone to go and locate my body I was killed tonight by a demon behind the store he threw my body in the dumpster.' He told us sitting down.  'How did you come back here?' Troy asked Austin.  'A guy named Nicholas sent me back here as a warrior like you two, there were a dozen more being sent back too.' He said when a white mist appeared.  CHAPTER FIVE  Nicholas stood in the middle of the room in a long white gown, long white hair and beard, with tan sandals on his feet. He had a golden glow that radiated around him as he smiled so meekly at us.  'Well my two favorite warriors Montana and Troy.' He said holding his hands out towards us.  'Your Highness how may we serve you?' we asked kneeling down at his feet as he laid his hands on the top of our heads.  'We are going to move you all to a place in Alaska where you will train the newest warriors and keep the older ones up on their training every three months. You will go and purchase the land and the housing facilities and start working with these new warriors to adjust to their new lives.' He said vanishing as an envelope fell on the floor where he had been standing. Inside was one hundred thousand dollars for us to relocate and set up the new living quarters.  The three of us vanished leaving Ariana with Ricky while we went to Austin's body. He was so mutilated by the demon that there was hardly anything left of Austin's remains. I turned when I saw a black glittering object in my peripheral vision to my left. She was huge and green with pointed ears and yellow stringy hair, her eyes began to glow a brilliant purple. We looked at her as she hissed at us as she had planned to finish feeding on Austin's body. What really concerned us was the fact that she was pregnant.  She leaped at us through the air when Troy hit her with a lightening bolt at the same time I hit her with a large energy ball blowing her and her unborn demon fetus up.  We reported the unfortunate death of Sergeant Austin Tyler behind the store of the seven eleven on forty Ninth Street. The crime scene was out there when they noticed the new Native American guy with me.  'He's my brother Tala he has come to take us home due to a family emergency.' I told my fellow officers.  Well it went a lot more smoother then I had imagined with saying good bye and to my surprise Ariana moved with us to help take care of Ricky. I guess if you thought about it she was right a bunch of Angel Warrior's couldn't very well be responsible raising a child and orbing in and out to fight evil. So now we were all off to train the new warriors or fallen officers how ever you wanted to look at it.  We stayed at a resort in Fairbanks until we found the right place. We all fit in with the Alaskan people and Anoki was well liked there. We were able to purchase thirty acres of land with an adorable cabin on it until we were able to build the training compound. As far as the towns people knew we were with the Special Forces and were building a training camp. We didn't lie we are a unit of Special Forces just we left out that we were Arch Angels. We were different then most Angels we felt passions and emotions that most angels do not. I guess you could call us Supernatural beings, Good witches fighting the evil ones.  We had completed the training camp in two months, there were men and women's quarters, each room held two occupants. We made one large food hall where we all ate our meals having to look as normal as possible to the towns people, we had a school set up with class rooms, each class room held classes for shape shifting into different forms, learning how to orb, how to walk through objects and how to use their supernatural powers. We had an obstacle course climbing up and over walls that were twelve feet high, running through huge tires without falling. We trained just as if we were in the armed services.  By the time the warriors were trained and accepted their transition into their new life we had a new group to train. We had officers from the military, law enforcement, the F.B.I. any persons who were killed while serving to protect became Arch Angels.  I taught orbing and shape shifting, Troy taught transferring through walls and how to run up walls and ceilings and Austin taught them how to use their abilities to throw fireballs, lightening bolts, energy balls, And how to become invisible so not to be detected.  Ariana cooked the meals, inspected the rooms, and gave them their new identities and assignments. Troy and Ariana were becoming more and more involved with each other and Austin and I were closer then ever before. We had a heated pool built in the enclosed gym.  The summer days were long and the evenings turned cool, we had special blinds placed in the house so we could block out the day light during the summer months when the sun did not set until midnight and then in the winter months you did everything in the dark. The weather took some time to get use to one day it could be seventy and sunny one day or it could be rainy and in the forty's, I learnt to be prepared.  Christmas was great everybody celebrated, the carolers were treated with doughnuts, cookies or candy and sometimes fish pie. We all decorated the way we would at home. We all came from all over so we had a little bit of all the different countries at our Christmas and Ricky loved it; he received gifts, stocking filled with candies and Dutch shoes filled with candies. The food hall was filled with different aromas of food being cooked from baked salmon to turkey's being smoked, baked and fried. We invited the town's people so we could show them our appreciation for being accepted and from all the help they gave to us when we first started building. That Christmas will always have a warming effect in my heart for a Christmas gift Austin bought us our sled dogs, they were beautiful huskies and we took them out for the very first time just the two of us, I sat in front of Austin with his legs and arms wrapped around me and blankets over us and our fur parkas. We rode through the woods on our property and Austin helped himself to putting his hands inside of my parka and shirt to my warm nipples that became erect from the touch of cold fingers. I managed to turn myself around so I could gain access to his parka and began to obtain access to his erection that gently nudged the out side of my cheek yearning for the warmth of my mouth I began to orally pleasure him, it was cold and the sleigh we broke in nicely as I managed to escape my pants and straddled him as we made our own heat, the warmth of his moist mouth on my breast made them feel very brisk with an almost burning sensation from the coldness that seemed to intensify our passions that were building with in our bodies as my hips moved on him in a steady circular motion and than taking him deeper and harder into me until we both cried out from the orgasm that was sent through our bodies like powerful explosions as our mouths sought the other and our tongues tasted the others mouth and deep moans could be heard through out the night inside of our woods. It was one of the most satisfying rides I had ever experienced and Austin even made death an adventure. When we arrived back at the house to join the rest it was drawn to our attention that we each wore the other ones snow pants. I turned many shades of red at that moment and fell into my husbands arms as we laughed at being caught making love. It made our romp in the bedroom some how even more pleasurable as Miss. Elf had to find Santa's joy stick under the covers. Yes that was a Christmas I will always remember.  The last eight years has been great out here, we have a great fishing business on the side and we are getting ready to enter our dogs into the annual sled dog race. Austin and Troy have won every year and Troy has not been a wolf in a while since our female husky fell in love with him, but a human. We only shape shift now when we go back to Pompano Beach to visit and of course to track down a few demons who Michael introduced to the area.  Aliana and Bruce Trembly a newly married couple disappeared off the face of the earth with help from Michael and his crew of evil worshipers. We were running out of time for the bride who was still a virgin was to be sacrificed during one of their worships.Anoki and our sled dogs began tracking their scent from the church.  Aliana stood before her new husband Bruce as they held hands vowing to love only each other before God and all of their guest. They had just turned to walk out of the church as husband and wife when a dozen demons broke into the church doors; everyone began screaming as the grotesque beings ran down the isle killing people who got their way with lightening bolts. The first demon who looked like an over grown iguana grabbed Aliana who tried to fight him off but she wasn't any match for him. Bruce was also taken and the third demon that was all red with black stripes turned into Michael and slit the throat of the preacher who was feverously praying for his parishioners souls from this attack by these evil beings. Michael smiled as he felt our presence coming to the church and vanished before we could battle with them. I saw the evil grin on his well chiseled feature face and then he vanished into a black sparkling mist and I saw the smile on his face. I heard people screaming and we were able to kill three of the demons. I swore to avenge the deaths of the innocents who lost their lives that horrible day. The people were more fearful then ever as they witnessed the abduction of Aliana and Bruce and then the murder of their beloved minister. I followed behind Anoki soaring through the sky as an eagle with twenty of our arch angels as we raced to stop the virgin from being sacrificed at midnight. Anoki and our sled dogs ran through the mountains and woods as we flew over top trying to pick up their trail.  Austin and other warriors were at the church trying to get people help who had been injured by the demons and to make sure they were not attacked again by the demons.  Finally we picked up their scent in an abandoned cave in the mountain. Going inside it was almost magical looking with the crystal like rocks glistening and as we went further inside we saw candles, we heard people chanting and a woman scream a blood curdling scream, my heart raced fearing we were to late when we entered where the ceremony was being held. I saw Bruce lying on the floor decapitated and I remembered my own demise and we began to attack while three of our arch angels rescued Aliana as she lay nude on the alter to be sacrificed to evil I transformed into myself in front of Michael who smiled so evilly at me.  'Montana your everything that Thomas said you were.' He told me touching my chin with his hand.  'Did Thomas also tell you that I have a pet peeve about decapitation?' I asked raising my hand to destroy him when he disappeared in the black sparkling mist.  I looked defeated, I should have been faster with my attack when I looked and saw a red rose floating down to my feet.  'Jerk.' I said knowing it was Michael gloating over his escape.  Aliana had been taken back to the compound to be treated and to help her to deal with her loss of her new husband. I knew Michael would be back for her since the sacrifice had not been completed so she needed our protection around the clock. She helped Ariana with work around the compound and with Ricky.  We began helping the local police department to help catch a vicious serial killer that had through the years killed over forty women by hunting them down like animals in the wilderness.  Frankie Dajeck began his killing spree at the age of fourteen when he lured a school mate named Patty into the woods near the school and began hunting the young thirteen year old girl with his new shot gun his step father Rex had bought for him. Frankie had it all planned before school and had hid his gun in the woods. Patty tried to escape her crazed school mate by dodging bullets that flew past her head. Patty sat crouched behind a tree trying to keep her sobs from being heard by Frankie. Frankie crept up on his prey quietly not making a sound, not even breathing and he shot her between the eyes killing her instantly. Frankie removed a charm bracelet to start his trophy collection of the game he hunted and killed. The police were looking for an older killer never once did they even think it was a fourteen year old boy who they were searching for. Frankie put distance between him and the other hunts he went on, going into neighboring towns and meeting young teenage girls who were heavy and not popular in school. Frankie met Lisa a thirteen year old girl who was extremely heavy with red short curly hair, her face covered in freckles, with brown eyes. The day she met Frankie she was walking to school and he persuaded her to skip school with him. He knew the bright orange shirt she wore with her blue jeans and white sneakers would make it easier in tracking her in the woods that sat fifteen minutes from her home. Lisa knew she should be in school, but Frankie liked her where the other kids would just make fun of her at school. Half the time she ran to her classes to avoid the names they called her and to avoid the other kids who wanted to fight her to look tough. She spent most of her days in school depressed and scared. As the walked deeper into the woods Frankie picked up his gun leaning against the tree.  'You better run or die cause I am hunting fat sows today.' He told her aiming the gun at her and laughing.  'Stop it Frankie your not funny.' She said as tears burnt her eyes from his insult, she had believed he really liked her.  'I ain't trying to be funny, run or die!' He yelled at her so menacing.  Lisa ran from him with her heart beating hard in her chest, she kept looking backwards hoping she could get to her house just down the road when she tripped over rope that he tied across the path between the two trees. She was crying as she tried to get up off the ground when he kicked her in her ribs causing her to fall over gasping for air.  'Bye, bye little piggy.' He told her smiling and pointing the gun down at her.  'No! Please don't please don't hurt.....  She never got to finish the sentence he had blown half her face away. He knelt down beside her smiling and ripped the peace sign on the black raw hide necklace from her neck. He walked away feeling victorious in his hunt.  By the time he was twenty years old he had twenty trophies in his chest. He would smile at them every night before going to bed. He married his eighteen year old girlfriend and they lived with his parents until their first child was born.  Fifteen years had past and Frankie was thirty five years old and working on his forty eighth victim. He and his family were up standing towns people; they attended church every Sunday while Frankie went hunting every Saturday.  It was on one of his hunting trips that we met the great hunter. It was my faithful student Wynona and myself we were dressed in white fur jackets, white sweaters, black shiny spandex pants and six inch spiked heels, we wore more make up then the women on the televised church shows and our hair got more teasing then any man has ever been teased. We worked in the red light district where all the working girls picked up their so called dates. Frankie decided he would get closer to his fifty mark even faster if he took us two girls with him.  We rode with him in his black Lincoln with black tinted windows. It made him look important and he kept his hair died black as not to look as old as he was. He wore a beard and mustache, and dressed like a lumber jack on his hunts. He looked at us smiling thinking that we thought we were going to a cabin to have wild sex.   You Have The Right To Remain Silent by Erotica_Writings Â© 'Ok ladies start running or I will kill you both where you stand.' He yelled at us.  I began laughing. 'Oh no please mister big bad man don't shoot us!' I told him mocking him to anger him.  He became outraged. 'You bitch!' he told me shooting me between my eyes. I hit the ground, he looked at Wynona. 'Run or die whore.' He yelled.  She looked at him.' I have a head ache you run.' She told him chewing her gum.  'I just killed your friend and you want to be a smart ass?' he asked her.  'No you did not kill me I beg to differ with you.' I said standing up with a huge hole between my eyes. His face looked as if he saw a ghost.  CHAPTER SIX  The hunter becomes the hunted and Frankie was not happy that we changed his rules to his hunt, he ran through the woods and behind every tree was one of his victims screaming and grabbing at him. His heart was beating wildly in his chest and head. He grabbed his ears to try and drown out the beating of his own heart driving him crazy. Wynona and I just walked calmly after him; he could not get away from us. He fell on the ground crying.  'Please don't hurt me.' He begged us as tears streaked his face with dirt on it.  Lisa walked up to him and kicking him in his side.' Say bye, bye little piggy.' She told him laughing just as he had laughed at her and he felt the pain of his face being ripped away from his head.  Patty walked up to him. 'Run or die Frankie!' she yelled at him.  He ran and ran and hid behind the tree from Patty when she stepped out shooting him between the eyes. He died that night in the same exact manner as each one of his victims did that night and every Saturday night for the rest of his remaining days on earth he was sentenced by us to live in the fear that he made his victims feel in the state prison mental institution for the criminally insane where he is to remain for one thousand seventy six years plus a life and one day sentence without any chance of parole. His family moved to another part of the United States where no one knew them or of Frankie.  We all felt good knowing we had caught the jerk and the women could breath easier now.  We began training our dogs for the up coming race, we had taken on three new packs and this year the women were entering the race along with Ricky and one of his school mates Johnny. Ariana and I were team mates, as were Austin and Troy. It was extremely cold that day, there was talk of canceling it if the storm was to hit us but they said it would be hitting in a few days, we were off and running, the cold wind was very brisk, the towns people were cheering as we came by them. It was exciting, but I had a vision of the storm and Ricky being trapped. I told Ariana we had to get to him; he was already three miles ahead of us. The winds began blowing harder as the storm had picked up speed and was closing in on us. We could hardly see in front us now because of the strong winds of eighty miles an hour; the snow flurries weren't helping either. Using my powers I landed Ariana and the dogs back at the compound and I went to Ricky finding them stuck by a downed tree. They were happy to see me and I was able to get them back to the compound and erasing their memory of any magic they witnessed.  I went back out with the other angels to help find the other towns people who were trapped by the storm that struck us without warning. We could hardly see our selves, but we came upon a small girl of three and her father who was fatally injured, he was slipping away and I laid my hands on his wound, a bright light of gold began to shine and the wound was healed. James took the father and daughter back to the compound while we went on to help more people through the night. The wind howled through the trees, we flew through the air fighting the strong winds and we decided it would be safer to stay in the cave we found and Paul invented heat so to speak for us, I used my vision to track any lost people who were trapped in the storm like radar and would fly out to retrieve them. We spent the night in the cave with thirty of the town's people. Austin took a large icicle and turned it into baked fish, breads and fruits. Everyone fell to sleep on pallets we had sent for from the compound. If anyone did have any memory of us as Arch Angels they never mentioned it, we continued on with our work from that day on. Ricky has since that day graduated and is an outstanding Alaskan police officer and one day he will take his place among the Special Forces with the rest of us. In the mean time we continue to battle Michael and all evil things that come our way. Well we better go before Austin forgets he is my husband and I will be forced to make it very cold in our room tonight. Come on and I will tell you more of our adventures we've had on the way to meet with him.    "

"       Prolouge to a Mack part I - 12/8/2001      Up until about 8th grade I had not had a girlfriend before. Finally I asked out this one girl who I barely knew. It wasn't really a physical relationship, or a speaking one, it was more just flirtatious gestures from time to time. To my dismay it ended because of a lack of trust. I now consider it more of a test run for my relationships.  Then came the time when I had sharpened my skills around females and began to actually hit on someone. This ended worse than I could have possibly imagined. The person I began to mack on was a band person, which made things difficult to begin with. Band took up two class periods and we had a completly differnt lunch so I could spend a maximum of one period with her. Every chance I got I would call her and try to be with her, seeing as how that would only be about a half hour a day. Our school was having an astroworld field trip that year and my girlfriend and I were both going. So I was thinking, 'un un uh, I'm gonna get me some this trip.' We picked partners before we started going out so I had to walk all over the park looking for her. When I found her I was like, 'hey hows it going, wanna step out for a moment...'  'uh no I'd rather sit here and flirt with your best friend.'(didnt actually say this)  So I was following her around trying to chat with her and every time I'd get a word in she'd start talking to Mr. X, my best friend. Needless to say it was a bad field trip.  Somehow I forgave her, and our relationship was fine for about a week or two more. Then I'm like, 'alright, astroworld sucked, so now being my birth-day, I'm really gonna get some... Oh yeah.' So I walk up to her before school started and she goes in a strange tone 'oh Bryan here... happy-birthday...' and hands me a note. I get to class and read the first two lines:  Happy birthday Bryan!!!  I'm breaking up with you for Mr. X      Prolouge to a Mack Part 2 - 12/9/2001      Continued from 'Prolouge to a Mack Part 1'  I was crushed, nothing can match the heart-break I felt. That single note sent my self-esteem to a dark ages. And I was like that until the summer...  I finally got involved with my churches youth-group that summer and I was overwhelmed by what a pleasant enviorment it was. I had never been in a happier place. Soon a some of the hot girls there began to hit on me, so I'm all like, 'well ya know mabye the long-term kinda relationship aint for me. Ya know mabye I was put on this earth just to knock someone.' Soon enough came this confrence thing where the whole youth group goes for about two days or so. During that time I hit on a total of three girls.  Girl #1: I began to get my mack on, and it was working pretty well until this stalker guy started to rival me so I backed off.  Girl #2: This time I started and right off the bat she goes, 'uh get off me; you're gay', well that sucked.  Girl #3: Finally I started to make some progress; This girl and I gave off some flirtatious gestures from time to time, small talk, ya know the good stuff. Finally when the dance came time I walked up to her and she said, 'Oh uh... I can't be around someone all day... bye!'  I began to realize an actual relationship is what I really needed in my life.      Prolouge to a Mack Part 3 - 12/12/2001      Okay, so I'm not that great of a mack, lets face it. It was that time I said, 'God, I'm not a Mack, and my relationships don't work out so well. Give me some guidence.' Now for people who think God doesn't listen... he does. Sure enough, I found the perfect person in my youth-group for me. Smart, funny, we had almost everything in common. The only disadvantage was she had a boyfriend at the time.  Well, for some reasons, many including the boyfriend was kinda a depressed person (I don't really know the details for reasons which will be explained). To me this was a total victory, now if only I could just sway her a bit... Ah-ha I thought! If I took her to my homecoming she'll surely fall in the deep undeniable love with me that I had with her. Well, as it turned out she went with me and... nothing happened. Well a few weeks later I start to talk to her and ask her some menial issues, and she just kinda shut me out. I have no idea what I had done. She wouldn't really talk to me at all. She seemed so depressed, and thinking she was a great friend I tried to comfort her. Unfortunatly, she just wouldn't have it.  So as you all can see my life has had many relationship flaws from time to time. Alas, nothing can hold me down, as mentioned earlier I have a never dying happiness. Unfortunately I would be slightly happier if I had someone in my life who I could share my happieness with...      Can't Nobody Hold me Down!!! - 12/12/2001    Well now that I've finished the Mack Saga I can start talking about my current life.  I'm 14, I live in Houston, Texas, I'm in to rap, girls, IM (Btsunami2001), and all that other mess. I guess I'm pretty funny and like to chat alot.  g2g so if anyone wants to chat:  Holla back!          Finals... Arrrrrrrrgh!!! - 12/14/2001      Ah I cannot stand finals. Though this is my first year to take them, I am utterly overwhelmed by them. It doesn't help having some really mean teachers who give unquestionably hard exams. I had to do like six differnt projects today and am very stressed out.  I know this one girl who is all like, 'Hey you are looking at a girls body... don't you care at all about personality... you stupid pig!' Now if thats all I did I could understand that argument, but that garden tool has had a boyfriend for about a year now and is giveing herself off to half the guys she knows (excluding me thankfully) and she and her boyfriend knock boots everytime they get a chance. All I said was that I could not go out wit' a girl that took no care of her physical apperence. I don't care how smart, friendly and funny you are, you've gotta take care of your body. Brilliance does not mean you have to throw your apperance away. I mean come on, I wouldn't expect a girl to go out wit me if I didn't bath comb my hair or trim my nails, I should think that girls should have to at least be cleanly and shave. Only exception: A mortal sin against your religion.(Which I know of no religions that have that, but why bother relying on me I'm an ignorant pig)j/k. Well aside from the village bicycle on my bus, today was fine. Not much going down, I'm still having relationship problems with my youth-group girl, but ah well, not my whole life.  Peace, love, and victory  HOLLA      Still Dre - 12/19/2001    Today I found out that my closest friend, indeed hates me with a passion. I was crushed, I thought that I could tell her everything. Alas, my life is still great, I'm having fun and that's all that matters.  Finals will soon be over and I will enter two weeks of bliss. Ah the Christmas holiday... goofing off, sleeping in, ah how miss thy blissful times. Well to all of ya'll who be hatin' on me I don't really care cause when Christmas roll's down, I'm still Bryan... and no one can take that from me.  Peace, Holla,  Bryan Mack      You can hate me now... - 12/19/2001      '...But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now.'  This is just a shout-out to all ya'll playa's who be hating on me... you know who you are! Like I said, you can hate on me now, but I dont give a $#@* cause nuthin' you can say will bring me down or stop me from what I do.  Hey Megan, yo in the hall you said thanks for something? Sorry, I was a bit messed up at the time. Well thats all I gotta say for right now.  Peace, (except for all you hatin' on me now)      Victory! - 12/21/2001      Finals are over, I have triumphed over that which has all but killed me... now for the next two weeks I'll be sitting on my a$$ and watchin' TV... the good life.  Well my finals were really hard but wit' a small bit of studying and goofing off I pulled them all off pretty good. I know that I got an 89 in english and bio. so I'm pretty happy about that.  Well now that I've told a bit about myself I guess I'll describe myself.  Height: 5'7''  Weight: Hopefully 150 lbs.  Dark thick brown hair.  Medium build, and thats about it.  HOLLA      Girls, Girls, Girls, Girls - 1/9/2002      Man, I've been so confused. I gave up on that youth group chick... heck I'm gonna stop goin' to that youth group period, but not cause of her. There be this famliy there, and every-single one of them make me wanna go on a killing spree.  Bad thing going down now is that all my playa's (You know who you are) think I'm just some guy who's in it for the physical... that just aint true at all. I'm very concerned with personality, unless the girl is like REALLY, REALLY ugly I would like her.  I kinda like three girls right now:  the first, I don't know her last name and I haven't actually spoken to her.  the second, I don't know her last name and don't go to her school, but on the plus side she really likes me  and the final one, well lets just say I'm not in her favor.  Anywayz,  Peace, Holla, Gettin' Your game on      Lets get it... - 1/10/2002      'Make this money, take this money, aint no way you can take this from me, aint s*** funni, shake it honey, take this money; now lets get it' G-Dep, lets get it  Shout outz...  This is for my playaz who've been wit' me long as I can remember...  Glenn ya crazy foo' keep pimp'n, Johnny you just need to go clubbin' some time, Ryan we need to work on you a bit.  For those I met few years back...  Nathan you got some issues boy, Jake... wonder ho powers... activate!!!, Meagan's wow there are like too many Meagans I know, Macy and Lauren go pimpin' with me sometime alright, Shannon and all the smarties' you're giving me some competition... stopit, Guardbabe you're a sweety holla! hehe, Christian you've got the son of God for a bro. thats cool.        Changes - 2/26/2002      First lemme make a few shout outz, Sheena, don' feel hated on; like tupac shakur said shortly before his death,'...buried as a G while teh whole world remembers me, until the end of time...' i will be ur hommie until  the end of time.  Nathan, you have now made it to king pimp, one, two, three, four, five... just kidding, you know that will always be my job... hahahahahaha!  BTW, don' none of ya'll be hating...'Really? get smacked silly, you get smacked silly, F***ing with these N*****...' G. Dep-Lets get it  A revalation which has just recently occered to me  :  Everyone in the THS band or guard are obsessive and exclusive people who are probably the worst part of our school. Now Glenn, johnny, vann and ne i missed, this don' mean u so stop ur biznitching.  As mentioned earlier... rap keeps me alive... it is probably my life force, it inspires me to become great and has lead me to a state of near mental balance (don't leave a note bout that nate, k? lol)  Alright, well G2G ya'll, Peace, Holla, and straight pimpin on wax... nuffin else matta's        I'm an school anthropologist... - 2/26/2002      ...that of course is provided they deal with studying the formation of social structures...  Being the overanalytical person that i naturally am i have mapped out the entire nerd clique at THS by tribe   Ekyd Group:  Two members inhabit this group, Kassie and Erica  They stay together because of their common hate for men and resentment to physical apperance. Also, they happen to be oversensative which makes them cling together in a host like way.  Central Nerds:  3-4 Memebers; Shannon, Nathan, Ben on occasion, and I. All of us tend to sling sexual jokes off at each other and have a lot of fun, cept when we make fun of ben, lol. Also are rather thick skinned and except for me are extreamly smart...  Kob and his followers:  7+ members, Kob is Jake and his lil' sub clique thingy goes down in that group, I really have no idea what holds this group together other than that they friends with jake and taht mess... very mystirous   Uncommons:  2 members, Emmit and Austin, they really arent nerds but they sort of hang aroudn with us... very strange.  1/2band nerds:  2 members, they are sort of band nerds but do not really stay in the band hall thus not making them zealous band nerds.        Diary to a Mack Part 4... - 2/27/2002      alright i said part three was the last but as u can see... it isnt...lol  PART 4... Playa Hata:  Alright as you know bout my g/f who broke up me on my birth-day was a band nerd...(worst peeps alive)And also like i've pointed out frequently I am a very forgiving and overly friendly person... so as you can imagine i forgave HO-BAT  I always talked to her bout shmit over teh summer, things were great and we were kickin it. we get back to school and so we be chattin and her and her all of a sudden like week into school she figuretively bish-slaps me... I'm like WTF HO-BAT, I forgave your a$$ and your all ridin me, so i basically stopped callin her right. Ahh but the pure treachory and that mess for band-nerds  did not end there, I sort of met this girl whom i'm gonna call guardbabe05  by accident, i'd go into the details but i don wanna blow my storage quota on one entry... but newayz, we met and i was tellin her my girl trubles on day so she goes, hey i'll hook u up wit this friend of mine. Being reluctant at first  i finally said, k wuteva. So i called this girl  and was kinda givin her the scoop on my classes and shmit. Durign this time i told her how i STRONGLY dislike my art teach and wished for her to... lets just say stop blinking for an excess of time. So GUARDBABE05's b/f, who is a hrny bstrd, was all like yo bryan, don say tat mess to a girl. Ok i know he has a g/f and i don but lets see he's a junior and GUARDBABE05, is a fish, comon he cant have that much game. it wud be like me goin out wit a 7th grader... ewwww... back on track... so i call up GUARDBABE05's friend again and am gonna pologize for slingin that crap and when she picks up the phone she's all like... um yeah, GUARDBABE05's friend is um, in the shower...  Quick synopsis for those who look at notes first: Forgave, got bishslapped, accidently met h0, chatted wit h0's friend, got jail R*****       Prolouge to a Mack Part 5... - 3/1/2002      Part 5, coming to terms:  Ya know people be saying how i need to hop up off the band nerds... I say F*** that S***, if i wanna throw flames i muthaf****** will and who ever is a ho a$$ enough to try and stop me can suck my MuthaF****** D***, but thats not the important thing...  The important thing is that last year i was all up in the school trying to fit into a certian clique: I wanted to be wit tha nerds but if we'd be talking about gaming or sumthin like taht and a prep walked by i'd get embarrased and stop talking... i wanted to be accepted by the band nerds last year too (blough, worst mistake of life... worst people concocted by God  ) but they cud only talk wit me for about ten mins a day so that went poorly... then i went to my youth group and i sort of lost my sense of embarrasment right... that was the best thing that could have happened to me. I now accept i'm one of the biggest nerds in the school... i goof on AIM for most of the day, play RPGs a lot and chat about computer S*** all day wit my peeps. The only thing i'm prouder to be other than a nerd is a Catholic  but still, ever since i realized that I WAS a nerd i became happier and happier,   NTM, I'm also gettin along a lot better with my playas from last year, and since most of us have open diaries its easy for us to chat alot. I'm really good friends with nathan the pimp-in-training, Jake who hates his Kob clan  and Shannon/sheena who are the smartest girls in the school  , it really amazed/humbled how i kick it wit all the smartasses of our class.  Quick synopsis: Once wanted to be a dumbshit band nerd, now i'm a nerd... NERDS ARE THE COOLEST PEEPS ALIVE, PREPS ARE ARROGANT, GOTHS SCARE THE F*** OUT OF ME, BANGERS CUT THEMSELVES  , PUNKS TRY TO BE NON-CONFORMISTS BUT BY DOING THAT THEY ARE CONFORMING TO THEIR OWN NON-CONFORMITY, AND BAND NERDS COMBINE ALL OF THOSE S**** TRAITS IN ONE CLIQUE... I'M TOO ANALYTICAL FOR MY OWN GOOD, WHY AM I WRITING IN CAP LOCK???, HOLLA BACK      Changes... um some more i guess - 3/10/2002      'that's just the way it is... things will never be the same... that's just the way it is...'  People be asking why I won't delete those lovely messages I get from whomever... BTW, the crazy ho-rat Amanda who left me the last note can suck my fat C***. Neway, the moral of this story is... this is my opendiary... i'm glad if people leave me notes, even if they are threatning of my life, so on and so forth. I'm not gonna delete them just cause someone put something mean on my S***. So all the peeps that be deleting my S***, grow up, its an open diary... notes are for everyone to put... you put ur s*** on my diary and i'll do the same to you... Reason i have an all note function is fo' my hommies Nate/Jake, not for cowards who wanna be unsigned so i can't find their ods. I'll keep leaving notes on band nerds' s***. BTW... to all ya'll hating on me, cris, band nerds, that mess...  'I aint trippin' i'm a playa, i aint sweatin him, I sex his sister and had her screaming like a mexican, with no remorse it was meant to happen; 'sides rappin only thing good i did was scrappin'; until the end of time.' 2pac shakur, until the end of time      Gin and Juice... - 3/11/2002      '...sippin' on gin and juice; laid back, with my mind on money and money on my mind...'  Reason for this title was... well my ex-friend's name is Cris which reminded me of crystal, a type of champaign frequently mentioned in rap, which then reminded me of the song Gin and Juice by Snoop Dog. I dunno, my mind wanders. neway this is bout her.  Timeline of my friendship wit her...  Begining of school: thought i was hot  we talked alot. was told she wanted to go out wit me, because she was a junior i thought that was just a joke...  month or two into skool: Started going out with this one guy. Didn't think much of him because of his rep. never actually saw him yet though. became friends instead of love interests... note: this girl is very hot.  Two or three months into skool: talked to her openly bout michelle, luv interest at time and currently... we chatted frequently and were good friends  Just before christmas break: recieved an awful, awful letter from her tellin me to back the f*** off and saying i shudnt go after michelle. now i was thinking that its okay for her to F*** her b/f every week  but its not ok for me to luv a girl.  Newayz the moral of that story is... one ho is better than two??? well actually that had nuffin to do with that but oh well, that's not the important thing.  Um, neway  if u read this Cris... suck my D*** u fat ho.  and if u read this Shell: I still sorta luv u... despite ur lack of emotional involment with me...  (michelle is really really hot... ask nathan.)      j'adore michelle... - 3/12/2002      That isnt a rap song either but... eh F*** it.  Loosly translated in french that means 'I love michelle'  Well if you don't know then don't bother thinking about it and if so here's tha deal.  Ya know I'm always trying to ask her stuff but she like never says nuffin to me, still i am drawn to her. I've got the damndest feeling that even if we were to go out that it would fail horribly leaving our friendship a smoking crater  see, she views high-school relationships as 'practice' for future ones. Ah, if only she knew how i felt... for the love of God no one tell her... wait, no one who reads this crap knows her newayz... haha, the beauty of my plan...   Funny story; Spring break, monday, five or so days before end of break... 8 page minimum paper, business presentation, French scrapbook, biology report; all of that is due in about five days... ARRGH!!! who told me high skool was gonna be a bish...? well everyone but ah well, its my own damn fault for being a procrastinating dumb $***  Newayz,  Peace, luv, HATING ON S***Y A$$ BAND FAGS; nuffin else matters.  HOLLA      Until the End of Time Part 1 - 3/13/2002      Guess what band nerds??? I can hate on you all I want... I'll still be me... Until the end of time...    Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side  Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die  And even though we both came from the same places  The money and the fame made us all change places  How could it be - through the misery that came to pass  The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask - for currency  But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave  Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see  It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?  Real homies help you get through  And come to know he'd do the same thang if he could  'Cos in the hood true homies make you feel good  And half the times we be actin' up call the cops  Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block  It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change  I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin  My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids  So you know, I don't hang around the house much  This all night, money making got me outta touch, shit  Ain't flashed a smile in a long while  An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs  My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo  Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo  For quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean  Smokin 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'  Who can I trust in this cold world?  My phony homey had a baby by my old girl  But I ain't trippin' I'm a player I ain't sweatin' him  I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican  His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen  Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time  Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?  To live my life as an Outlaw all along  Remain strong in this planet full of player haters  They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators  And in the end drinkin' Heneessy made all my enemies envy me  So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily  Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath  While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)  What I can see closer to achieve  In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G  Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need  An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G  Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw  Another album out, that's what I'm about, more  Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket  Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me  Until the end of time  So take, these broken wings  I need your hands to come and heal me once again  (Until the end of time)  So I can fly away, until the end of time  Until the end of time  Until the end of time          Coming to Terms... - 3/17/2002      Yes I'm also well aware that this title was not rap related at all... but  who cares, no one who reads my $hit likes rap anyway.  I have learned over the years that you can have all the friends in teh world, but if none of them like you, it makes no difference... instead, if you have at least 1 good friend, than it is unquestionablly better than one  thousand fake ones. Reason for me saying that is for two reasons. For the past 6 years of my life I was trying to follow the Preppy crowd... not really understanding where my ambitions lay or who I wanted to be with. I thank God that I have finally realized what I truly am: a nerd. I talk on AIM frequently and talk to my friends about games... and now that I have finally accepted and been open about this I have never been happier.  The second reason is because I do have a few truly good friends. What we all have in common is that we all wear masks. Though Nate appears a cold-hearted conservative to many people, I have had the chance to get to know him better and he is truly a fun loving person who... well he's still a conservative but, eh... Jake also seems distant many times. He will give you the impression that he is a jock and despises the ground everyone else walks on. Jake on the other hand is a very passionate person with a sense of humbleness that it is astonding. Then we have Shannon, upon hearing that she is the smartest person in the school you would think that she is arrogant and has no life. She is none of these, Shannon is witty, slightly insane, and humble for her  abilities.  I consider these three to be my true friends   We all have something in common and for the first time in my life I feel that I'm on the same frequency as someone else.  But the moral of this story is... if you're a playa with thousands of ho's and their all ugly... you're not really a playa, but if you only gots a few hot a$$ b****s then you're the best playa round... This is for my hot a$$ b****s,  HOLLA my pimps and pimpettes!!!      I don't believe in psychics but... - 3/18/2002      At this time you are feeling 'uptight' and you are urgently in need of rest and relaxation; but perhaps even more than that you need to overcome that feeling that you have been 'hard done by' and treated with a complete lack of consideration. Maybe you have, but whatever may have been the cause of your inherent anxiety, you regard the situation as intolerable. Your are, however, sufficiently competent to turn that situation around - you have overcome similar problems in the past, and really this one isn't too different.  You are looking for something different. Your imagination has been working overtime and you are seeking adventure - and you'd like to share that adventure, the new experience, with someone like yourself: Imaginative, Enthusiastic and Sensitive.  You feel truly deprived - not getting your fair share, but you have accepted the fact that that is the way things are at this time and that it is prudent to let matters slide and not hit your head against the wall -so conform and agree for a while. Accept the situation - nothing can last forever.  There is considerable amount of stress present in your life at this time and this is perhaps due to some considerable mental and physical frustration. There are various physical needs that are necessary for your well-being but whatever the reasons - mostly of your own making - your needs are not being fulfilled. We wonder why? You are under the impression that nobody seems to care for you. This predicament is most uncomfortable and it is because of this that you are experiencing far more stress than you feel you can cope with. You need to find a soul mate - someone who truly understands you and whose standards are as high as your own. As matters stand you would like to break away from the vicious cycle that you find yourself entrapped but this is easier said than done. You refuse to compromise with your opinions and essentially you are unable to resolve the situation because you are continually postponing the making of the necessary decision. You are stubborn but this should be no deterrent experiencing a happy life.  You are completely worn out and you are not in the mood for any further demands on your resources. The situation - such as it is - has rendered you quite helpless, unable to continue the mental battle that you have been pursuing for some considerable time. Enough is enough. All you would like to do now would be to have some time for yourself, to find a peaceful situation where you can recuperate in your own time.  ...I was just stunned when I read this... I always try to analyze myself... understand who I am... for the most part this summed it up... www.colorgenetics.com        Bad Intentions... - 3/19/2002    'I don't care for F***ers, I'm just drinking, smoking straight west coasting, B****s put your A$$ in motion, P**** poppin sex on lotion, raise it up... blaze it up... all these n**s, I dont give a F***. All i really know is that yo ho wants you to be with me, she aint playin', what i'm sayin'...' Doc Dre ft. Nock'Turn'Al, bad intentions...  Here's my average day... wake up at 6 and get my clean on, ride the lorenzo sportin' bus 2 skool, kick it with my pimps an' playa's, roll on down to trick a$$ Evan's or Moore-head, hop up an' on the bus 'gain, get my sleep on, wake up at six and dine and gin and juice, holla at my hommies again, listen to some tunes and think my thoughts til three, then hit tha muthaf***ing sac..  Translated: wake up at six and shower  , ride the bus to skool, hang out with my friends before skool starts, go to one of my least fav. classes, get back home and sleep till 6, eat dinner and goof off on AIM, then i goof off and listen to rap till 3 in the morning and wake up again.  the moral of this story is: if you smoke marijuana next to a russian nuclear silo, you're bound to end up destroying the entire universe...   Holla back my pimps and playas...      Gin and Juice... Da Remix... - 3/21/2002      Alright i'm well aware that gin and juice was not remixed... as far as im concerened...  Well, reason fo' writing this is cuz i need to update 'Gin and Juice' see the moral of thsi story is... Cris really didnt hate me, just her b/f did... haha... so me and her are cool now cuz we were like such great friends it wasnt even funni, we only incoded about 2% of our convo. nathan... haha.  But here's wtf's been going down recently... I am the happiest mutherf***er in the whole world. I got good friends, kazaa, a kick A$$ bro, life be good...  Hit me back my W****z      Severing Ties... - 3/24/2002      'you aint neva seen a N**** like me, never in yo' life; and that's what you can't understand' You can hate me now-P.D.  all of my playas been asking y i don' go after that shell girl... here's my reason... i have decided that it is simply a waste of my efforts and resources to persue this girl. She simply does not talk to me about anything of interest/seriousness, we go2 dif. skools which makes it hard, and she's a crazy ho... end of story...  also, to those of you who have heard my legacy of POP (my church) this will make more sense, if not than ask. Anyway, the moral behind this story is that I shall no longer support POP's youth group and simply continue as a regular catholic.  ah hell w/ it, i've got plenty of time...  THE LEGACY OF POP... dun, dun, dun...  I came to POP's youth ministry by chance; I should have been up at Washington state w/ my northern homies pickin' strawberries and makin' money... instead i stayed home and went to youth group... I was changed from a cold hearted indivig' to a loving and open person... the people there were so nice... especially the seniors... they all made me feel at home... welcome... I finally was able to be myself... or who I thought I was at the time... then skool rolled on in and as I walked into skool for the first time for three months, i sensed a forign, almost evil presence... From POP I learned to make fun of myself instead of others (its sooo much easier, think, if you're trying to come up w/ an insult you have to sit there and think and think... instead i just added on to their dis... and that got whoever to shut up)... As skool started i felt like everyone there was evil, blasphemers... i would constantly look down on people and mentally acuse them of being un-christian, hypocrits... then as I would go back to POP youth to sort of 'power up' my happiness... when i looked at my youth group a second time I noticed that something happened... the friendly enviorment had been tainted by two main sources... one of which being the 'Oil' family... and the second spawned from the Oils... let me just lable these as the 'Shawn Kara Stones'... well Shawn Kara whom had a high influence on my skool's peeps and $hit decided to flock his friends to the youth group... by that time I had realized that I was in fact a nerd and decided to lable out the entire clique system in my skool (i've got an actual gif. map if neone wants to see it... u've already seen it Squalhan)... and from that I had come to the realization that Preps are arrogant, stuck up fools... and Shawn Kara brought such people to POP... within a matter of weeks the entire system fell to the ground and died... no longer was my church a happy place to be... it had been infested by swarms of dark preps... I could no longer be happy there... Luckily I had found my tru playas at skool by then... I am very lucky to have been in POP when I was... it showed me who I truly am...      Selective Hearing... - 3/30/2002      I've got one thing to say 'bout all ya'll pissin on me... HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!! You think that your words can hurt me??? You're talking to me... ya know what? so what if i write like i'm black... You can all kiss my W*gga a$$. Just cause I don't act like some stuck up band F***er who could easily burrow a holein their fat a$$ b/f and live inside of him don't mean nuffin' i don' act white. My life is better than ya'lls cud ever be... I KNOW MY FRIENDS, MY FRIENDS ARE KICK A$$, THEY RNT IN BAND... exculding van, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M NOT TRYING TO EMULATE SOMEONE... SO THE REST OF YA'LL CAN GET ON YO' KNEES AND SUCK MY D***  hit me back playas!!!  FYI... LEARN TO F***ING LEAVE A SIGNED NOTE COWARDS!!!      Is this the end??? - 4/1/2002      'momma told me one day it would happen, but she never told me when; she told me it would happen when I was much older, wish it would have happened then (is this the end?)'  Here's wuts been on my mind recently...  Is life really worth living? I mean if this life is hell, logic would suggest that dying on earth would send you to either heaven or cause your conciousness to disipate... if your family betrays you, you anticipate failiure in life and death within at most a decade, you have a knack for harming all around you, and your lovelife is biting u in the gonads is life really worth living??? Not talking about suicide of course, its just... well i... i dont know, i just dont feel too good, lol. But none of ya'll shud feel bad for me... I have reached a state of mental clarity... hmmm, very strange. Haha, i know ya'll think i'm f***ed up but when have i ever cared... that's why i'm so proud to be me... cause i am me... Holla back foo's      Death, Remorse, Rebirth - 4/10/2002      Death...  Shannon once said, 'Bryan if you keep saying this S*** it will come back at you.' Natuarally I laughed it off and kept on making rude and uncalled for jokes not thinking of the consequences. One day I said something which, unknown to me, horribly effected a good friend of mine... when I heard what it did to her I couldn't believe it...  Remorse...  When I found out why it upset her so much I was sick with myself. I stepped out of my body and looked what i had become. i was a mean and hateful indivig'. The weekend after what I did, my parents, brother and I got in a large fight which I guess was my pennance. What i did to her was inexcusable and can only pray will be forgiven. Still, days after I found out I was still bitter and cold, even my best friends couldnt reach me. I realized a change was needed.  Rebirth...  I'm now trying to reconcil my sins with her adn others. haha, i comb my hair now too.  but the moral of the story is: if u do bad S***, it'll come back adn bite ur ballz off  other than that, peace love and pimpin'... nuffin else mata's... holla        One Mic... - 4/23/2002      'Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage One ni**a front, my face on the front page Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib One God to show me how to do things his son did Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin s*** Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages  Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken  Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in Blackin out as I shoot back, f**k gettin hit!' Nas, One Mic  Here's a funni story those close to me should enjoy:  -Alright, there's this guy rite?  -He was thinkin', 'ya know what? there's something missin' in my life. I need to hook up w/ someone.  -this guy did a lot of thinkin bout who he'd agsk out. he took the time to elmininate the fat, ugly, manish, annoying and emotionless people.  -so finally he found this one girl... this guy did some more thinkin'  -'Hmm... the last reltionships i'd been in i rushed in adn got screwed over rite? Lets try a dif. approach this time', thought the guy.  -'maybe if i got to know her and didnt force nething, stuff wud turn out better'  -so the guy waited and waited... boring... til that girl got curious as to who the guy was mackin' on.  -the guy was wise though and didnt tell her cause he didnt think the time was rite  -during the time the guy waited he noticed she really wasnt the person he wanted  -finally the girl hounded the guy enough he had to tell her  -'i really don' know if i like you nemore...' the guy said to her.  -the girl using all of her wisdom decided to ignor/avoid the guy in order to piss him off  -keep in mind that until the guy told that girl how he felt they were good friends... but the girl thought that they cudnt be friends nemore after he said taht.  -so had the guy kept his d*** mouf shut they'd still be buds    Tell me what ya'll think of that!!!

'but i aint trippin im a playa i aint sweatin him...' 2pac,  I'm still content... damn mask... about that. if any of yall didnt know, i wear a mask...  2 emotions-happy, furiously angry  perverse and rude  stupid and ignorant  ... well that's about it...  under this mask,  all emotions imaginable  sensitive and compassionate  witty and ... well non-iggnoarnt(poorly spelled btw, haha)  but most importantly a good person... haha, i should start taking off my mask thou... problem is that its not nearly as fun!  well newayz, shoutoutz to my playaz!!!  to the big five, see ya at astroworld  shammhammon, hey, you're my pimp  glenn, AHHH you're crazy  and the rest can kiss my... dog...  peace, love, becoming fused with the world's life force... nothing else matters...        (sigh) Life blows... - 7/19/2002      Darn, its been a while since I've written... hmm, well it's just because I've been so damn bored... haha. Well here's wuts been going down for the last... well since i last wrote:   As i've said before; 'Life's a b*tch, drink it up'... sadly, to this day I have no idea what that means. but i'm guessing its that no matter how much S*it goes down you've got to suck it up and get on w/ it. Well, its official, I've learned that when i tell myself my life is going well or that i'm good friends w/ sum1 i get screwed over somehow.  Now, there are many perfect examples of this but i'll just put in the few that recently occured:  1.Before: Hey, nate's a good friend, i really understand him and vise versa  After: Uh... well I'm still working that one out, some bad S*it is still going down, i dont know wut... hey, i'm still in the dark... haha.  2.Before: YOUTH GROUP IS AWSOME AND EVERYONE THERE IS COOL.  After: youth group sucks and i despise all who go there.  3:before: my parents and brother understand and really love me.  After: Well they think i'm some freak because i dont try to put myself on some pedistal above everyone else like they do and therefore treat me like dog S*it.  Well that concludes the three main things that are on my, I'm pissed off for the following reasons list. Now on to more pressing matters, (i talk like a complete idiot for one)  Hmm, I know ya'll(regarding all who actually read this crap) think that i'm only 15 and taht i should have absolutly no idea what i should do w/ my life... but i am iggnorant as always (just ask nate, he'll agree) to that and want to plan my entire life out.  I am really pissed off because three of my 3 life ambitions I'm going to have to decide one to pursue... sadly none of them are respected by my family members much less understood.  -Business dude: I duno, i just always loved my intro to buz class in 7th grade and would love to be in a suit w/ a bunch of other guys debating whether or not to buy or sell, (for some damned off reason that just appeals to me)  -Anthropologizer: (yes, i'm aware that is not a real word) as most of you know i love analyzing things, especially things w/ no relavence to real life. teh main con is that i'd have to actually do 'work' and as Mr. Ego mentioned, no airconditioning.  -Gaming Dude: I LOVE GAMING!!! and i love making games all the more, but in order to really be a famous one i'd have to start my own business and all that BS, but still it appeals to me. Unfortunatly no one in my family thinks thats a good idea cuz they think comp. sci. is some witch craft BS.  In conclusion... life blows... end of story, but the moral of this story is... don't drink and drive.        To Kob... - 7/22/2002      DUUUUUDE ITS SOO LATE!!! Yeah, but newayz.  I'm writing this because Kob has blocked EVERY SINGLE ONE of my screen names. (you gotta give him props for that, it took him like an hour.. haha) Here's what went down that fateful day (or evening, morning or any other part of the day it happened.);  Squalhan had this conversion rite,(i hope few peeps know who that is, o well) and despite my analasis of his personality he still believes that he will forever remain 'saint paul the second'. At the time it was really buggin' the shi* outa me so I asked a few of his friends what they thought about this sudden change in beliefs (dont get me wrong, he was Christian before but... well he's obsessive now). Kob happened to be one of the people i was inquioring about this issue. I said to him, 'don't you think nathan will stop being so preachy?'(well that was roughly it) and he replyed (also rougly quoted) 'yeah, he will become less active about it) So I was talking to Squalhan about him and his... evangilizing and the issue that people aggreeded w/ me that he would eventually change and I mentioned Kob was one of them. (now understand that in Squalhan's eyes, to change at all from that personality would be to 'fail' somehow... i never got that) K, so Squalhan and Kob are good friends and some crazy person said, well if Kob thinks you're gonna fail u shouldn't be as good friends w/ him or at all. So Squalhan told Kob this and... well apparetnly there was some miscomunication on all three of our parts.  Kob: Thought he would change his personality somehow  Me: Told Squalhan that he would stop evangilzing  Squalhan: Though Kob was out to make him fail thus ending their friendship.  Ending note... if any of you who actually reads this crap and knows who either of them are please tell them to read this... as I've said, Kob blocked ALL 32 OF MY SN's ARRGH!      Emotions... - 8/21/2002      Yeah, i've been trying to kill them off for the last year. They've brought me nothing but dispare. So I now only have 2 emotions. Bliss and rage. As the Count of Monte Cristo once said, 'one cannot feel ultimate bliss if he has not felt ultimate dispare'. So unfortunatly I can no longer feel ultimate bliss or ultimate dispare... well i'm sure i could feel ultimate dispare but I choose not to. Eh, rambling is good for the mind, I reccomend it. Friends stray, cliques disapate, but my mind shall always remain unchanged. Eh... and for this very reason is the cause of my turmoil. I bi+ch to da** much. I wish I could just talk to myself. I'm sure i'd have a great time.. heck i would get all of my jokes. Heh :-).  What is the meaning of life? to better yourself or those around you? Perhaps niether. Perhaps life is simply a trail before your last breath... what does it all matter thou? If you only worry about death then you can't worry about life, which defeats the purpose of worrying when you die, because you never really lived. I am now wondering how I became such a hating person. My parents, life, friends, or was it simply a path I chose to take?  I've also become to dam* analytical. This causes me to find flaws in everyone, also a reason why i can't be content. The irony of this all is that thou i can usually tell why someone duz something or acts a certain way I never learned to figure out myself. I guess I am the ultimate riddle, what am i... and why.  ~Roac Wind~      Empty... - 9/8/2002      That's all that I have left. My friends have left me abandonded, my parents just don't get my personality, laurel doesnt get the concept of homecoming (explained further down) and I don't understand love.  Over the summer my friends and I grew an unbreakable bond. When school started it broke, shannon decided i was a lazy F*** and nate fails to realize that I am bryan and always have been. plus i cant figure out whether or not cailyn hates me or not. I'm so alone...  I'm a god D*** nerd. my parents need to get over it, I am more comfotable in front of my computer screens than in front of them. They dont get anything about me, or wut i'm like. I'm so alone...  I met this great girl, asked her to homecoming (a ninety dollar investmetn) and she basically says she's gonna hang out w/ a group of freshman the whole time (which includes dancing w/ all of them. That is total bullshi*, if i'm gonna fork out a near hundred on a dam* nite ur practically my whore, so u damn well best act like it. (shell was the acception, i was working up to asking her out) I'm so alone...  The girl i was gonna go 2 homecoming w/ is awsome, we agree completely, but becuz i'm a sophmore i get the feeling she sees me as a superior and not equal... I dont want her to agree w/ me cuz i'm older, i want debate, argument, I dont want a slave (lest i spend 90 dollars on her lol) I'm so alone...  I need help, a friend.. something, please tell me you hear my cries...          on a less biatchy note... - 9/8/2002      Visit my site... it has my story on it and i'll be posting all my diary entries on it soon too. enjoy  http://www22.brinkster.com/nezro/rwproductions/base.htm  email me...      Love... - 9/15/2002      For many years now I have been trying to find it. Though I thought I was in love several times they proved to be flawed. Nothing more than a self-created illusion to hide me from truth... taht I am indeed alone. I suppose taht I choose to be alone. Or is it that don't know what love is... perhaps I shall never know.  Michelle was my 'first love'. She was beautiful, I thought we were alike in every way. Aside from the simple fact that she had absolutly no feeling for me.  I guess I loved Cris as far as my idea of love goes. She bore similar feelings for me, but her boyfriend drove us apart (in more ways than one)  A year later... I thought perhaps I was on the brink of falling for Laurel, but as I tried to fawn Michelle by taking her to homecoming, Laurel proved that our mindsets on relationships are different. Perhaps my mentality is greedy, I want Laurel to be mine and mine alone, however she wishes to share a tight 'friendship' with other guys... and w/ my past experiences w/ men in my g/f's relationships (diary of a mack part 1) that scares me... perhaps my last few emotions clinging on. Not to mention she constantly speaks of how other guys are cooing over her, and being the passive Xy (major inside joke) person that I am, I can do nothing about it. So is this God telling me that I am doomed to live my life alone... empty... w/o love? Or is this my primary challenge in life, to break my curse, and be loved?      Dying on the inside... - 10/11/2002      Well, looking back on this diary I've noticed a sort of rhythm to my entries. I go from being in a state of total bliss, for instance when I was in youth group. To a state of anger and depression. But for the time being I haven't slipped outa that phase of depression. I can't honostly say who my true friends are anymore. I once thought the nerd clique was inclusive and friendly... but recently found out they are arrogant, hateful and narrow minded. No longer do I belong to anyone or anything... I can't conform for I have found nothing of any level to conform to. I can feel myself slipping further and further away into darkness. I don't know if i'm going insane or just horribly depressed. I guess it's always been true that I could never tell what I was/am thinking.  Im no longer as articulate or strong as I once was... I am... I am, I don't know... perhaps I'm dying on the inside... but I can never show it. No one knows...      10/17/02 - 10/17/2002      Externally, Bryan is a very happy person full of energy and life. Willing go above and beyond to get a laugh outa someone.  Internally, my life sucks, friends have been treachorous (not all), my lovelife shall never get better... much less exist and lastly as i mentioned before, I'm slowly dying on the inside... life is fading away until i shall become mentally unstable.  I suppose before I leave this place.. into a deep pain where there is no return I might as well get out a few last thoughts... I've never been good at writing down what I'm feeling until recently. I am happy at school, but I think its just a shell, I'm empty... alone... and I don't think anyone is responsible for it; yes, it is my own hands that have caused me to spiral into this dark pit of depression. When I come home and try to sum up why life is good... I come up with nothing.  Friends from last year, nathan and I have just been drifting apart since he 'found Jesus', he just doesn't get me and plus I'm like so far down on his 'friends to talk to list' that when i want ot talk to him, I have to wait in a line, and when I get up there i'm pushed away. And he wonders why I blocked him.  Shannon, well, as many of you know, she had a lengthy convo w/ nathan(me on his sn) that was nothing but bashing me (several pages long) and you can imagine how that affected our friendship... its gotten better. But I guess she's just tolerating me.  Ben, i guess now that we're not in PE we don't have enough time to get philosophical... or perhaps too much time. We argue on most everything now, and without fail every time he will end with 'you're dumb, don't talk to me anymore'... hmm, reminds me of kevin.  Bret, the only person I can say nothing negative about, even during m darkest hour and my first falling from the clique he stayed with me (first falling was that convo w/ shannon) He has never been bitter or an asshole... and I should thank him indefinetly for that...  It doesn't help that I have several classes primarily with freshman... and quite frankly, every single one of the 'nerd' freshman are arrogant bastards. Never in my experience of analyzing the sophmore nerds have i seen more arrogance, Calvin holds no ground to any of them (btw, that guy is so fickle on whetehr or not he's going to be nice to me I didn't even bother noting him in the friend list thing)  I shall leave my precious readers with this, One cannot find a brilliant mind if all they can do is call them stupid.      The end of it all... - 10/17/2002      Externally, Bryan is a very happy person full of energy and life. Willing go above and beyond to get a laugh outa someone.

Homecoming... - 10/18/2002      I'm so damn lonely it isn't funny... this entire event is nothing more than somehting to make you feel lonely. well guess what, it's succeeded      My wonderful parents... - 10/21/2002      Hah, that's a load of bull$hit. As I've mentioned I can't stand stupid and ignorant people. But it's only worse if they handle money. I spent aproximately 4 hours writing a debate case the nite before and becuz my printer blows a$$ I have to keep transfering the file to print it out. As I finished both cases I put it on a disk and took it to the shit computer to print it out on and it was completely corrupted... coluldtn be opened. So I spent the next 2 hours in the nite trying to get it to work... to no prevail. Hence, I went to sleep 5:35 and work up 5:42. My case was hoss boss too, but becuz of my shit ass old computers I LOST EVERYTHING. Now this was a mistake that could have been prevented but would be EASIER BY ALL MEANS IF I JUST HAD A RELIABLE PRINTER/ COMPUTER. So i bring them teh paper that shows i have like 12 hundred in their account and tell them I'm buy a new computer. THEY WONT LET ME AND HAVE ABSOLUTLY NO REASON FOR IT. IF YOU CANT SEE WHY IM PISSED JUST TRY STAYING UP AN ENTIRE DAY, ALMOST PASSING OUT IN 3 CLASSES AND GETTING *UCKED OVER ON A GRADE CUZ UR PARENTS ARE STUPID. GAWW I HATE THEM      hug and a wish... - 10/23/2002      A hug... That's what I could use right about now. As for my wish... I guess someone to share my life with... to be with, someone who understands me. I guess in all these years trying to rid myself of anger, hatred and cruelty I have grown weak. Am I being weak by needing someone? By wanting 2 be w/ someone? Or is that just my true self emerging. *sigh* how I desire I could understand myself better      Counting my blessings... - 10/25/2002      What I found odd was that ben actually reads my diary... and that he left a note. Initially I was like, 'wtf? can't you b**** at me some other time? But i now realize that he is correct. I have been taking the ' i need special treatment and am now a demi-god. I want to take some time and openly thank those I may have been an A$$hole 2.  Ben, first and formost I am sorry for not realizing my fault. I tend to do that alot if you havn't noticed. I understand that we both get personal in our debates... well every time and I suppose I should either argue w/ you less or less passionately to maintain a friendship  Shannon, she has really set me straight this year. I now realize that i had been a slacker (and still am) for the first part of the year, i'm still working on it but yeah, thanks shan.  Nate, He taught me about how greedy I am... unintentionally but I need to realize taht I'm not the center of all life, (though I wish it to be tru :) And that friends shud stick w/ each other  Bret, though I havnt biatched at him I'd just like 2 thank him for never... uh, disenting. He's been nothing but kind to me even when I was quite the oposite to him. Btw, Catholics pown major a$$ (pown is like own and... i didnt find out what hte p was for but heh, its still cool)  Moral of todays story is... uh, 'Xy' haha    Adiue, I bid thee good-bye - 10/30/2002      As some of you know I have/had a friend who recently got into drugs. Though her personality is similar to mine as it was when I was a freshman she has chosen to handle her problems... her depression differently. I once thought to have a relationship further than friends w/ this girl. But when I heard of her drug problem my heart felt compassion and so I tried to help her. However, as I extended my hand to help this girl she did not just turn it away, but push it away. This girl has tought me that you cannot help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Wrong decisions give birth to wrong decisions and she is making one of them. Though it is sad to see a friend slip into a darkness taht even I have not crossed I cannot allow myself to be dragged any deeper into that pit.  To those of you afflicted by depression, I beg you don't turn to drugs or sex. I hate sounding preachy but it will honostly do nothing but send you into an even further depression. I'll give you the one reason I never did or will do drugs. Friends. When I was faced with the opportunity to smoke weed (which i researched heavily leaving me moderate on the subject) I wanted to try it. But when I looked back to where it matters; I suppose my friends taught me how to live. And for that I thank you dearly.  Thank-you Bret, Ben, Nathan, Shannon and Jake. You may not know it, but you have saved my life... time and time again      Being Driven Slowly Insane... - 11/4/2002      Why do those who don't love you cause you the most grief? That is what I've been asking myself recently. I have decided that love is over rated and is the reason that I have tried to kill my emotions. Unless you are one of the select few capable of finding someone whom you can share your life with, you find yourself tearing your hair out wondering why God chose you to be alone. So often to I try to laugh something off but deep inside my soul it burns, and it shall not stop burning until that which I have saught so long is found... Love. I have been searching for such a period of time I think my mission has blurred my vision. I havn't been able to figure out why those who look forsomething can't seem to find it, but when you don't give a damn it just pops up. That is the way I am. So often do I see people mindlessly using the term 'love' and 'relationship' but it means nothing to them because they needn't a journey to find it. But if I ever do find my love it will be held above all else because it is precious to me. Sadly I don't see any in the near future.  I ask again why those who don't want you cause you the most pain, and steal away your soul by constantly running through your mind. So often do I want to just run away from the idea but it is ever persistent. The hope for love hunts me down but always strikes me in the heart. This strike leaves not happiness in it's wake... but trials and anguish. What sickens me all the more is the people who do this to you and find pleasaure in it. They woo you over like a siren and most times you are too desperate to avoid the painful call, so time and time again you are wounded in the heart... wounds leave scars, scars leave pain and thus you have my life. My heart is now scarred and gushing with a terrible pain which I can only express to one person. (they may or may not know who tehy are)  Perhaps it is not just the person I vie over that scars me but myself. I too often make the illusion that there is hope, there is chance in my pursuit of happiness. But when I do try and find hope, it is snatched away, murderd by the bringer of pain, the bringer of love. How ironic those two qualitiese are held by one person. I am nieve... I am hurt.      Links in My Chain - 11/5/2002      Well, I do this every few months or so because my whole 'people I'm friends w/' status changes like the weather.  Jake: Prolly the only person who understands what I'm going through right now because we have the same problem. (if you don't know what it is just look back the last five or so entries) He's hilarious and also an avid gamer (NERDS ROCK)  Nate: Meh, we've had better times but we've also had worse. Nate and I debate over anything and everything irrelatvent in thsi world. From the credibility of fan gamers to who'd win in a fight between the all mighty Sephiroth... and some weak hobbits. (guess who i'm rooting for)  Shan: I still think she hates me but 'meh, wutever'  Benn: This guy has really taught me that I was/am stuck up and should try and not be... which I have for the most part. I'd also like to thank him for all the help he's been in regards to debate.  Bret: He has been nothing but nice to me (he even took me home which was completely out of his way) And I also thank him for putting up with my constnat questions about debate and such. (I'd have told myself to screw off by now if I was in his shoes)  To those of you I did not mention don't think you aren't part of my life (well, some of you aren't so stop bitchin) but these are the people whom I think have affected my personality the most and changed my mentality on several things.  +Peace  (haha, if you guess who i stole that from u get a cookie)      For no one else but me... - 11/5/2002      I fail to see how greed in a relationship is bad. My view on relationships are that your g/f or b/f is someone a step up from a good friend. I want to be able to share my feelings with my girlfriend. Why is that greed not justified? A friend of mine quoted this Weezer song and though I dislike that genre of music I felt the excerpt conveyed my current view on the topic of a 'relationship' (the text in quote is the song and below it i have reflections)  'I want a girl who will laugh for no one else:'  --I want my girlfriend to know I will be there for them and them alone, so they don't have to find false humor in others.  'When I'm away she puts her make-up on the shelf:'  --I want my girlfriend to be satisfied with me and me alone, so she doesn't have to flash herself off to those around her to get attention.  'When I'm away she never leaves the house:'  --I want my girlfriend to realize that I will always come back and that they shudn't need 2 go searching for me.  'I want a girl who laughs for no one else'  Am I not justified? Can someone explain why pouring all your love into someone and not recieving just return is good? My mind is a torrential fire... and I havn't the slightest idea why I continue my pursuit on 'the phantom' (as I shall refer to her) if she causes me so much pain. I am Roac Wind... yet I subject myself to this pain, this futile attempt at love... why?      The Reaper removes 'Phantom's' veil... - 11/7/2002      Something that recently occured to me is that beauty is in every way in the eye of the beholder. When you love someone their beauty is exagorated one hundred fold. This also applies to mental beauty. When you get this image in your mind of someone, they in essence put a veil over your eyes making their true appereance and personality in fabricated. That's why when you either fall out of love with someone, you start noticing when their hair is sloppy, or they make rude gestures. This same theory can be applied to anger. Many times people say things that are hurting to someone. Their excuse is 'ididnt mean it'. I believe however, that anger purifies one's judgement. When you are angry you speak the truth.  This just seems like crappy philosophy and rambling but I have a point behind it. For too long did I let this false image of 'the phantom' cloud my judgment and perception of her. I thought she was beatiful, smart, and friendly. But after she unveiled me by playing with my emotions and feelings I now see the truth. Where I once saw beauty I now see someone who has lost their faith and turned to drugs/alchohal. Where I once saw intelect, I now see she has chosen to do stupid thigns and uses poor justification for them. Lastly, where I once saw openness and friendlyness, I now see the monster of a siren that is her true form. She is insequre with her life and because of that she hides in a crowd of men and though says they are 'just friends' really knows in the back of her mind they wanna bang her. She takes pleasure in this pain. She is nothing more than a fisher reeling a fish into her boat... only to throw it back when it gets too close. She asks for help but refuses to accept any. She wants to help but neglects to do so.  Though I feel a piece of me is missing because of this unveiling I know it is for the best and I need to come to terms with the fact that no woman is worth the time and energy one would have, or has put into her. According to my anaylsis she has a mental disord possilby steming from her famliy. It is the typical 360 approach on famliy life. She sees her famliy and despises them, but when she makes the same mistakes they made/make, she justifies herself, 'well they did it too'. In my honost opinion there is no help for her...      Tournament and a Feud... - 11/12/2002      Well, this last weekend was my first debate tournament and I have 2 admit it was an assload of a fun time (I have no idea the precise amount that an assload consists of) I went 1-2 in the debate but made it to finals in Extemporaneous (im telling u, Humanities has TRAINED me to bs) As of right now I have 21 NFL points (national forensics league and need 50 to letter. I want to eventually get 250 so I can judge but meh) I hope to get fifty by next time cuz i'm most likly gonna do a few more events... and hopefully win more debates...  While the actual tourny was fun the result was less than beuno (spanish for good.. i think, i'm in german so wutever) The main reason was that Ben and I were the only one's who broke in Extempt so Bret was just waiting for us to finish so we could leave. I told them ahead of time 'either ben and i had win or lose... I don't want either of us to be waiting up' cuz the thing takes aroudn a bagillion years. Well, I broke in semi's and Ben didn't which was my fear. I said 'I'm pissed cuz i broke and u didn't' in the sense that I didn't want to have bret and him to wait another hour. Ben took it as being arrogant (but seriously, am i ever arrogant?) and was speaking about it behind my back in D's room. That pisses me off cuz i'm always getting ragged on by the Debate 2 guys and now i'm sure D thinks i'm some arrogant prick... meh, life sucks...  In a lighter note Ben eventually apologized for his attack. (note: this was an actual entry opposed to my philosophy for the day)      The crimson tears of abuse... - 11/18/2002      Freaky title huh? But it's true. No, I'm not talking about physical abuse, God has blessed me with ... 'relatively' even tempered parents. I speak about the abuse of principle. Too often do I hear the word 'love' used. I too am guilty of having abused this word. Using the word 'love' is like sex. The more you use it the less it means. I might say 'I love my girlfriend' (in the unlikely event I ever have one :)) and it is empty. People put 'love' into their relationships and I honostly think 'love' should be reserved for marraige (in regards to relationships) because you really dont love someone until you are willing to forfit the rest of your life to them. Understandibally I 'love' some people, Cris being a prime example. Yet again, it is not the same kind of love, I love her as a friend whom I could talk to forever.  I suppose the Crow (as I will be refering to him now) is the only person who understands this. We both yearn for it, but only to see it snatched away from us. But the more painful thing I see is people who abuse the word. And figurtively, I cry crimson tears... tears with passion, tears of my blood which I have spilt trying to find the one thing out of reach... love...      My analysis... - 11/18/2002      hah, I'm prolly not over her (all i need is something else to think about... haha, jenna ur awsome) but one thing that has helped me realize why she's wrong for me is pick her worthless soul apart (see, it's already working)  The phantom revealed... *dun dun dun*  First, I'd like to point out this girl has some serious brain problems. (good wording huh?) Her happiness relies on surrounding herself around boys whom want to.. err, do the nasty w/ her (haha, havnt said that in a while) Yet, like a siren, she only allows you to get so close and then treats you like shit. This is easy for the phantom because of her constant false complements and praises.  Secondly, of all of her misdeeds and mistakes she has made exp. drugs, sex, drinking, ect (haha sounds like a rapper) she attributes to her parents and friends. in my opinion, to use that excuse is bullshit. Especially the parents issue. My parents have made countless mistakes and do I say, 'well gee, if they did it so should I'? Quite the opposite, life is about bettering onesself and making the world a better place to live in. I evolve, I become better than my parents.  End analysis: She marries some weak dude, fucks around and gets wasted on a weekly basis, poor dude is too weak to do nething about it, she OD's or gets raped... end  Could this entry have been any more gloom?      So alone... - 12/2/2002      I don't know wuts wrong w/ me. I'm so depressed right now, I prolly gonna fail all my shit classes. I keep getting my hopes up high for something, but every time they come crashing down like a big pile of shit that you just can't dig your way out of. I'm trying to stay 'moral' but the lonelier I get the harder it is to actualy maintain my own ethics. I love this world but I hate being in it. I'm a social being and I am disgusted seeing other ppl in a relationship simply cuz I can't be in one myself. Be it my own doing or simply no one loves me enough take that extra step w/ me. Sometimes I jsut don't see the point in existing. I know life demands trials to gain wisdom but what is wrong with ignorance? Damnit how am i to maintain my fu**ing morality when I have nothign to strive for? When I wake up I don't go 'gee, today will be an awsome day.' It's like, I just wake up to pass another day. I'm so fu**ing confused it's not even funny. I found myself staring at the comp screen for like an hour cuz I can't seem to find an equal, a soulmate. No one can possibly understand what that's like... so lonely, so tired... someone give me a reason to not give up...      Dumb people are... - 12/2/2002      ... Dumb, plane and simple, 'dumb ppl are dumb'. This year has been a prime example of that. I'm ranting about this specifically cuz in debate we're discusing 'should cafeteria food be inspected and tested by health inspectors?' WHAT KINDA GAY CRAP IS THAT? One of the students thought it was a 'serious' issue in todays modern society and so half the class voted on it. I honostly wanted to walk up to that girl and slap her. Of course its inspected. There is no  should  about it, lets play devils advocate really quick. No, I would actually enjoy having fecal matter, baby parts and other such disgusting things fuzed into my food. Even if you think that's a good idea the question is all the more stupid becuz we are REQUIRED BY LAW to inspect it. I couldnt just bring a batch of homemade cookies to school, it would be ezier to bring a gun then something homemade to THS. Son of a bitch i'm mad cuz of that. It's just so F**ing stupid. Believe you me, before we're done discussing it I will have smacked my head into the desk so many times I will have successfully dropped my IQ by ninety five points. SON OF A BITCH THIS IS GAY!      Aint what it used to be... - 12/20/2002      Is it me or did this year just suck some major balls. I mean I can remember last year how everything went great, I was aceing most of my classes. (sigh) where did it all go? I just get the feeling a giant shit ball is hovering above earth and glaring down going 'hah, I'm a giant shit ball ruining ur life' Example of last years goodness, A. I wasn't attracted to crazy whore psycho bitches, instead just a catholic crazy... B. Humanities was soo much cooler back then, we talked about poonanny half the time... C. Life currently sucks. See, those are just some of the reasons. This is primarily just a rant w/ absolutly no philosophical backing... *what a surprise* BTW, in 12 hours I'll be done with finals and taking a major nap (it being aproximately 11:52 PM CST as of right now)  Yeah, jake's coming over friday, then nathan sunday. I'm just glad they resolved all that BS. It was seriously a one week feud *poorly spelled* and last but not least. LEAVE SOME DAMN NOTES, the reasons its an open diary is so i can get some input... I want to know ppl actually read my crap *crap not meaning actual fecies but a reference to my writing* end.      Happy New Years Damnit... - 1/1/2003      yep, my resolution will prolly be something like 'do your homework' or 'don't piss people off' or 'quit your blind rage attacks'. Iduno, prolly sumthing I'm just going to blow off. Nate got me IWD2 (Icewind Dale 2) and Akira for Christmas, ich bin sehr happy... well, happy isn't german to my knowlege but FUC* YOU... woahhh.. need to go to bed sooner. It's around 1:47 AM right now. Yep, sleep is needed... diablo 2 is needed more, I bid ya'll adieu.      Not to get my hopes up... - 1/7/2003      Well, I think I have found my place better this year than I had last year. Though my grades are sucking, in regards to friendships I believe I have mended any wounds and strengthened old bonds. Today Nathril actually asked me to be his lab partner. Now that may seem like nothing to you but it was very important to me. I'm usually the one in teh class who gets stuck with the four armed kid who vomits constantly... or I would have to pay my partner a considerable sum.  Another good thing is that I'm 'seeing eye to eye' with most of my friends now, and it is to my understanding that I've worked past the... unpleasentness with shannon. Many things are good now (Ihave no girlfriend but that's... well... life isn't perfect haha) Though I fear writing this because as I have mentioned countless times,  when you think life is going easy and great, someone/or something finds a way to prove you wrong.  But I'd like to be able to look back and say that I was indeed once happy.  now for a bit of my philosophy...    Roac's Sub-Divine Philosophy on Life...    I am unaware what the main asperations of many people are, and I do not even know solidly what mine are. However the one thing I want is to be remembered, but more importantly to be remembered for something important. This may seem like a foolish dream because I won't be around to witness my post-humonous fame, but I would enjoy being able to great the reaper and know my legacy won't be forgotten... I don't want to fade away in history. I want nothing more than to have people tens, hundreds or even thousands of years look back and say, 'hey, remember such and such about Roac?'. This seems like a silly and unlikely dream but... well, you need something to hope for or else what is life worth living?  End.      Well Jesus Christ I've always been a conformist.. - 1/30/2003      One thing I'd like to mention is that yes, I am indeed grounded from the internet and am at school right now. I hate school  Yep, this entry is basically to complain about my love life as my other two friends Nathril and Aeryn have. I figure my main problem is I cannot be myself around a girl who I want to date. I feel like I always have to impress them and that actually raises my charisma, and I fervently hate charisma. I have never been one to hoot and holler at a sports game, nor can I scream on a rollercoaster, I've never been able to scream when I'm not angry. And so my false charisma pisses me off first because I want my girlfriend to like me for who I am and respect my personality. and secondly because I always f**k up somewhere along the line. I just try to act like some badass, but doing that just isn't me. I like being able to make fun of myself, kick myself in the dirt. I like being the one who's comic relief, I don't want to pretend I'm some hotshot because honostly, I am indeed not. So I can't act like myself around a girl I'm infatuated with, and I'm terrible at flirting, I make those crappy pickup lines like 'ur daddy musta been a baker cuz u have nice buns' look good. So it has been decided that teh only possible way for me to hook up with someone is if they have been my friend for some time and suddenly go head over heals for me. And the odds fo that parallel the likely hood of a giant shit ball coming down and eating my pants right off me.  I loved Michelle, I loved Cris, I loved Laurel... one by one I singlehandedly destroyed my relationship with them. I was a complete and total idiot around Michelle, I cannot blame her for not liking me. I completely ignored Cris until she started going out with someone else and then screwed up our friendship. And I ruined my love/friendship w/ Laurel by realizing she's a F**king crazy whore b*tch. I need to find someone for me... someone that completes the puzzle which I call my mind.  Someone asked me why I wanted a girlfriend. Honostly, at that time I hadn't a good answer. But I look back to 8th grade when I was going out with Amie and I can say I was truly happy. I could call her and tell her how my day was and she could do the same. I had someone to talk to... someone to be with. Though it ended in misery I enjoyed the short time I had. someone to talk to...  I AM ROAC F**KING WIND!!! NO GOAL IS UNCONQUERABLE TO ME... and yet this task is proving more than formidable for me. Life is to short to be depressed... life is too short...    Just fade away...      Wind, Fire and Water... - 1/30/2003        I am reaper of the whirlwind...     I feel that I have grown closer to water, and yet further away from fire. I have never been able to find contentment with all of my life. If school is going great, family sucks, if family is great, school sucks. Water and I are near parallel on our mentalities towards life, love and gaming. Fire and I are too, but... something is amiss.    Water flows...     Water is great, we can always laugh about girls (lacktherof) and talk about fantasy crap. Not to be taken the wrong way, but I feel very close to him for some reason. But the sad thing being, is that I have been a constant a$$hole to him and yet he's repaid me with nothing but kindness and a hearty laugh. My abrasive attitude causes harm, but expects friendship in return. I thank water very much for not just getting up, punching me in the face and spitting on me... which he should have done many a time. I still think his views on capital punishment and war on Iraq are stupid, never will i conceed on that point!!!    Fire burns...     Fire too is very close to me, (yet again, not to be taken the wrong way) yet we constantly get in disputes. His mentality dictates it to be a total argument, while I want concession and contentment. I seem to be taking his jokes more and more personally, and I return it with a firey fist. I don't want to. Shannon set me straight, I made a critical coment and she just totally made me think, she said, 'why do u always bash fire when he thinks ur great' now ifeel terrible... life is crap        Valentines Day... - 2/13/2003      $hit, I'm alone again. I can't feel it because I've been single for so da** long. But I can remember, back to the time I wasn't... I remember the good feeling that having a girlfriend brought me. If I had the power to cry I just might. I am the lone wolf. But sometimes I wish I wasn't.    I got my letter jacket today so that was a plus. Hoo ah I look like a stud in it... heh, yeah. Not really but it makes me feel good on the inside. I've decided that for my birthday all I want are books, money and anime. That's all that I really enjoy anymore.  My book is coming along nicely. I am just throwing in bits and parts of my book to keep from sounding repetative. If that makes any sense. I wish nothing more than to have my book be famous. Or even be printed. I want to look back and hold my paper back book and say 'this was a beautiful creation'. I want to be remembered. Life is to short to be sad. Just fade... away...    Those who oppose me shall fall       Wha ha ho... - 2/25/2003      How did my diary become a center for war between people? And I can't even guess who's leaving the notes. It must be either Nate, Jake or Sheena cause they're the only people who read the diary but hmm... Just sign ur damn name sometime.      I just don't know anymore... - 4/16/2003      I'm being told that stagnation is bad, and that accepting change is a good thing. But why? If I enjoy staying in my own little group, if I enjoy having a minimal (at best) social life, than why should I be forced to change? I enjoy who I am and where I am. Heaven forbid I find a comfort zone and enjoy being there. What scares me is those around me are changing. Are going to parties, are drinking. That just is not me.  The same friend was confused when I told him I couldn't date a party girl. A girl who drinks. Why is that so hard to believe? My zone is one where I can sit down and just talk to a friend. I don't want a cup in one hand and a lighter in teh other. Quite frankly, the party setting doesn't appeal to me. Happieness comes from surrounding onesself with friends, so what good is it to surround yourself with people you dont know? I cant walk up to someone and just hit it off. A fault, I admit that but I also accept it. I wish I could become more social. But looking at what that 'social' attitude foreshadows does not appeal to me. I want to be liked, but as I've always thought, the most popular person gets the most compliments, and the most insults.  Roac Wind... That is who I am. That is who I shall forever be God willing. I want to keep to my morals, to keep to my friends.   Just Fade... Just fade away...       Wind's Triforce... - 4/22/2003      There are three things that bind me to this world. Well, actually more than three but these are the things which I hold closest to my heart... *tear* The reason I'm putting these down now is because Ascaril was telling me how if his current catch didn't like his music, he didn't know if he could like her. The reason being is that that is the main thing they could relate on, not video games or anything.  The triforce of Wisdom:  Fantasy, the whole concept of the dark ages fantasy facinates me. Unfortuantly I have no friends dedicated enough (save(except for) cpt. Capitalist), to play DnD with me. I love forgotten realms and one of my goals in life is to write a sucessful fantasy story. Or perhaps just make a movie on the Drizzt saga (too gory thou)  The triforce of Courage:  Gaming, why is gaming courage? I couldn't bring myself to admit that I enjoy gaming until my ninth grade year, thus it took a mound of valor to accept my lot in life. Gaming, I prolly spend to much time on it but hey, it's like any sport... except for the lack of physical involvment. Haha, someone sprained their leg playing DDR. The sad thing is, we (gamers) want gaming to become more and more realistic making the lines between reality and gaming blur. I can't wait till there is no line. I would love for there to be a game like .hack, full body interface, unfortunatly I would willingly be someone like Tsukasa.  The triforce of Power:  Anime, the greatest form of entertainment media ever. American movies have never affected me as much as a single anime has. It captures raw emotion. Hollywood simply waters down everything, 'the hero always wins unscathed, peace reigns, everything is peaceful in the end'. Akira is a prime example of this. The world's future was never certain, and at the end of the movie it still isnt. Escaflowne, (if you havnt seen the movie and are planning on watching it, don't read this) Lord Van and Hitomi had finally found someone, each other, it was a great love story of bonding. And after the conflict was over, after Hitomi completed her mission, she was swept away. American movies can never do that for me.  I figure that at least one of these similar passions ahs to be shared by my significant other. That is another reason why I am doubting my attraction to CB. I just dont know...    Just fade... away.........      5/27/03 - 5/27/2003      Well, with what my friends have been writing recently, I believe a more appropriate name for FoD would be 'Fuc*ed over Diary'. Meh, we all bit*h from time to time. I do it more so than others. Ironically I've been doing good for the past while, I love driving (hoo-ah), I love summer (aolrjlek) and I love kung fu fighting (hiy-yah!). Well, there is one thing that disturbs me though...    Shit that disturbes Roac (crazy music)   Aite (haha, that's some ghetto words I still have) There's this girl I like right (notice how all my stories start like that and ALWAYS have some side commentary). However, she's apparently rounded home a few times. Ya'll should know by now that I am for teh most part... unsettled at best when i know a girl who is 'broken in', now as Ascaril(and everyone else) so tactfully pointed out, there really aren't any untainted girls anymore. You're either sheltered and ignorant like faith, or have been around your street a few times much like Ms Johnson. Now, putting aside that fact, my main question is, provided we do go out, am I strong enough to hold to my morals in the event she confronts me? Always optomistic and supportive, Ascaril said 'no'. Not that I disagree, but I would like to honostly say, yes, I stood in the face of temptation and walked away (w/o succumbing to temptation). Most fo my friends have taken the, 'well I'm basically dropping my original opinions of morals on that issue', like rats fleeing from a sinking ship (not to compare them to rats). Ben is the only friend I have really who is keeping his head on (or at least acts like it). Mom asked me if I would have liked to take Roach's class last year so I could have learned more, and I simply responded no. I seriously doubt I would be as much a neo-con as I am now, or as involved with world affairs (I watch cnn at least an hour aday, my fish year I couldn't tell you what cnn was). I'm pissed off that Ben can't take concurrent b/c I would have enjoyed bitching at Lord Cackle B*tch and the rest of her Once-A-Monthly Reich (fem-nazi's).  Well @#$%...    Just fade... away...      I am... Tetsuo... - 6/8/2003      What did that mean? DId Tetsuo become the 'new Akira' or was he simply another grain in the unfathomable power that is Akira? And what about Hitomi? I mean WTF kinda ending was that. I wanted closure, she just spirited away, never to be seen again. Did Van ever get her back, or was their whole experience together simply designed to free them of their painful lives. But one thing's for damned sure, never will she meet a guy who's cooler than a guy who has got wings, i mean how badass is that?  ... I want wings.  Yeah, I was going to take this girl out this week, but apparently some foreign object was shoved directly into her hole of eternal darkness. So suffice to say we aren't going out any time soon... or speaking for that matter. I mean what kinda shit is that? I'd go into detail but I don't really care anymore. She wasn't really my type. Didn't like gaming, didn't know what anime is, and even though she says she likes to debate, I honostly think she couldn't point to the middle east on a map of only the middle east with a title in large bold print saying  the middle east . One less thing to worry about.  Who am I? There have always been two things I've believed in my life. Death, and the fact that if you think that you're doing something innovative or saying something new, it's been done or said at least twice. Which is sadly ironic because I would like to be able to attribute that witty phrase to myself. I know that about two people on earth regularly read this, myself, and Nathril (Note: he is like the only one with an elemental name that is like his own, thus anyone can guess who it is), but at the present moment Nathril and I are having... rough times to say the least. I'd go into detail but yet again, I'll be the only one reading this, and I hope to have all this crap in 20 years.  Anyway, I love this excerpt from Cowboy Bebop... here's my take on it.    '... There once was a tiger striped cat,  this cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million times,  and was owned by various people who he didn't care for,  the cat wasn't afraid to die,  one day, the cat was reborn a free cat, a stray cat,  he met a white female cat, and the two spent their days happily together,  years passed by,  and the white cat died of old age,  the tiger-stripped cat cried a million times,  and then died,  it never came back to life...', Spike   Okay, so Spike goes through life crappily, he finally meets his woman who he loves very much, she dies, he gets pissed off and ends his life in the best ten minutes of anime I can recollect (keeping in mind my shitty memory for things that are the best). So let's put this in a timeline... better yet, let's call it the timeline of JUSTICE!!!!    THE TIMELINE OF JUSTICE   1-life is crappy and repetative  2-life is good but temporary  3-your bitch dies and then you die  See, I'm going to say I'm at about a one now...   See you later space cowboy...        Giving credit where credit is not due... - 6/9/2003      'How do you feel that you're losing your two closest friends right now?'  2 things wrong with that statement:  A. Logically, at the time that was said, they were far (jake and nate) from it.  B. I mean s*it, if you're gonna go and cry about something for a hella long time and pull a silent treatment 'you no longer exist stance' why would I bother putting up w/ them?  I can distinctly recall Ben and I getting in a semi-fight. I totally bi*ched him out during algebra and i think the following afternoon he wrote me an apology email. I felt bad after doing it too him but I didn't apologize. Now did Ben stop talking to me? No, because Ben can see that I am stubbourn as shi+. I have constantly bashed Bret and he has really never done anything outrightly mean to me.  Who would I say I'm closest to this summer?  -Well shit, Ben has never done harm to me. I mean he even talked to me even when teh entire history class of fascists allied against me in a non speaking pact... or something of that nature.  -Well shit, when Bret and I go out to do something, I don't go watch him look for video games having wasted a fuc*ing half tank of gas. We go watch a movie, or go to astroworld. Nor does he decide to watch LOTR instead of going to astroworld. Bret is a great friend.  woah, that was a crappy entry, mind cloggy.. meh w/e...    '... I am a force with whom there is no recokoning..'      Well son of a bitc*... - 6/13/2003      Yet again there a series of unsigned notes flying all around my diary and Ashley's by an unsigned person. Now initially i was under teh assumption that they were sticking up for me, and now it seems they are attacking me just as much. Now, i obviously have a few hypothosises as of to who this person is, but I shall keep those to myself for now. I request that whoever it is (being a person or persons) contact me either by my email  RoacWind@hotmail.com , or by AIM  Roac Wind . Obviously I'm not expecting whoever you are to be entirly forthcoming, however I would simply like to know who you are and what your motivation for leaving those notes is.  For a side note, for the two guys who have totally broken off of my 'friendship', you seem to visit my diary enough to understand the events that have recently been transpiring.  For my final word today... well, in this diary because I will obviously fill the world with my speech and so forth:    ICH BIN DER KONIG... AUS KEINE HOSEN!!!        Hail Hitler!!! - 6/20/2003    That's right, despite my best efforts I am indeed under the employment of a  Quiznazi . I work at Quizno's and my manager is a nazi... meh, my humor is wasted on too few people. Essentially Kikku (an Indian hyberbitch), is so damn cheap that she pinches every penny until lincoln bleeds from his eyes. My starting wage was $5.35, I mean wtf? I know a fifteen year old who is starting at 6. What really infuriates me is her propencity for passing the blame of not only herself but other employees onto me. Now, understand the following description will be part sarcastic:  [sarcasm]  Kikku in a hyperbitch voice (yeah, you know the one), 'Well Jesus Christ Bryan, why the hell is the son shining, the customers aren't buying things as a result!'  Me, 'Well I would imagine because the fusion reaction occuring is resulting in a release of light and heat energy, as for the employees...'  Kikku, 'SHUT UP! I'm not paying you to talk'  [/sarcasm]  Meanwhile another employee will be out in the back smoking on an unpaid break. Seriously though, this bitch actually reminds me of the Lord of Terror herself... Ms. Power. I believe that this lady is the physical embodiement of being cheap.  [sarcasm]  I will slap on guacamole (or however it is spelled) and she will start screaming about how expensive it is and try to wipe it off. This of course is while the customer is right there watching her be cheap. The customer consequently, will run in terror as her cheap rays radiate throughout the store having witnessed this.  [/sarcasm]  I am then blamed for that because I am not  efficient  enough.  Other than the Lord of Cheap, there is this 27 year old guy who is in there with this longass gay poneytail all acting like a badass. He's like, 'yeah, i'm just soo damn cool because i don't have a high school diploma and make sandwhiches to support myself. And as a result of my poor choices in life, I will be a total prick' I just wanna be, 'dude, you're at quiznos... you're 27... wtf???' (of course i wouldn't say 'wtf' i'd actually say, what the fuck)  Well, suffice to say, going to my job is like inserting a giant, rusty pole lined with barbed wire into my ass. Too graphic you say? I'm only talking about  going to my job . It wouldn't be legal to make an analogy to  being  there.  in other news, I happen to be volunteering at my church's Jesus class thing for little kids. I honostly believe there is a future childmolester/fag captain. You don't believe me, but this guy (who ironically resembles Piggy), no joke was humping another dude and grabing his 'privates' throughout the day. I tried to stop him but i was just so stunned, 'noo, don't do that, arrgh, for the love of Jesus' kept running through my mind.  Meh, I guess going to a Catholic Church you're bound to expect to see those sorts of things, haha.  See you later space samurai...        Dies ist mein mittleres Finger Weibchen!!! - 6/20/2003      That is an english to german free translation of ' this is my middle finger bitch!!! '. I am thinking of quitting the store and saying that too the Quiznazi... obviously while holding up my middle finger. I'm thinking up a variety of phrases that I will say to her on my final exit of the store. Most of which are in the developmental stage.  Okay, so essentially I get phone call around 5:30 (keeping in mind this is one of the two days I get free this week) and guess who it is. Now, i'm sure most of you guessed Kikku, the physical manifestation of cheapness, and you are right. If you guessed someone else... than you may have been right, there probably were other people calling me around that time. She leaves this bullshit message:  [sarcasm]  'Bryan!!! This is Kikku, from Quizno's, yeah, you know the one you work at. Anyway, I need your help desperatly, the store is on fire, a pack of wolves have broken in and eaten some of the customers, baal and Diablo are running loose... oh, and we're short handed and need your help.'  [/sarcasm]  I didn't pick up the phone and so my parents were like, ' holy shit bryan, this is your opportunity to make her happy ' or some bullshit like that. Now, my thinking was that I was going to leave her to be consumed by the fires of being a bitch and cheapness which she brought to the store, but finally I reluctantly called her back and told her I was coming. (hey, more money for me and I need to buy mroe games... or so I'm told)  Now, this is really my favorite part. I enter through the front door, and there are a bunch of people lined up trying to get their subs. No joke, it seemed like this blinding, heavenly light (as seen by Saul at his conversion on the road to Damascus) shone behind me and I was carrying the magical, holy sword of Tyreal. I step up and start helping Kikku and this other inexperienced guy make subs and while wrapping one up the guy (Andy) turns ot me and says, 'my god... you have saved us.'  It was the funniest thing. Now, Kikku's all like, 'um, sweetie, could you clean the floor for me?'. Granted, it was better than her usual, 'Bryan, I need you to turn this bottle of water into wine in five seconds... or else', but the thing was it was such faked bullshit i wanted to laugh at her.  Much to my satisfaction, Sean, the 27 year old thug captain with gay hair, had apparently quit which is why they were short handed.  My final question is, in a one on one fight, what would you rather have, a sword, or a gun?  See you later space janitor...        Ballad of the Fallen Angels... - 6/21/2003        Angels banished from heaven have no choice but to become demons...     My name... is Roac Wind    I have come to the conclusion that I am, despite what I would care for, much like a combination of my two favorite characters.  Roac Wind: Charismatic, he can bring a group of people (or an army for that matter) together with such vigor and passion. On the other hand, he's not as much a talented fighter, but he does have fighting spirit.  Brello Tsudanaga: Unrivalably physically strong, his strength comes from sheer determination and willpower, no man or beast can hold ground with him. Unlike Roac though, he is stoic and unfriendly. He prefers to do things on his own and generally hates people.  Hah, if only i could combine the two good traits! I have Roac's lack of physical talent combined w/ Brello's antisocialism. Now, as Nathril has pointed out, yes, I was yelling in agrument w/ him after knowing him for about a day. But while I can argue someone through a wall... or is it i can argue a wall (probably the latter), if i get on the right subject, I couldn't get up in front of a group of people and just start screaming and laughing. I'd be the one who goes in the corner and contemplates the physics of the room, anthropologizes the scenario if you will.  If I could come to school decked out in feudal japan clothes w/ a bigass katana at my side I would. 'well bryan, you need to turn in your homework' my teacher would declare.  'HIETEN MITZURUGI STYLE UPPERCUT!!!' (reference to Rurouni Kenshin) By the end of that war cry, my sword would already have sliced my demonic instructor in half.  Yeah, that would be cool...      May the 7th, 1945... today! - 6/26/2003      Yes that's right, this was the day that the nazi regime was toppled by the allies (specifically the US b/c we just own ass). A similar feat was accomplished today by an american citizen, namely me. After several bloody weeks of non stop combat and skirmishes, I have found employment under a non fascist... I hope.  It's so great, I will be working at Rib Tickler with Bret, Ben and... uh, myself. Well, despite what you may think (you being whoever has been keeping up with the crap in my od) It took a bit of consideration on whether or not to switch jobs. Firstly, I'm already trained, and pretty damn good) at Quizno's, so more training will probably piss me off. Secondly, there is a super fine girl who works with me, i mean dayyyyyyymn. Lastly, I am sorta going out with this other chick who works there named ashley. No, this one could actually tell you that the UN is not just a prefix.  So in conclusion...  Boo!      Gimme a N-E-O-C-O-N... What's that spell? - 6/26/2003      Well, it has come to my attention that I have always been a conservative. Alright, when it comes to my faith I'm as liberal as they come... or so I am fathoming. But in regards to polotics, I've always agreed with the death penalty and opposed abortion. However, thanks to Ben having rubbed off on me this past year, I have converted to being a semi-neocon (neo conservative). But for a few liberal views, I am a full fledged conservative republican.  Ironically, back when I first met Nathril, I believe 'conservative' to be synonomous with ignorant and short sighted. However, I believe a better term would be realist. Now, I was never the 'give peace a chance' or 'well, saddam isn't that bad of a guy' liberal, but I guess I just listened to D'Arrigo too much. Haha. Well, I left the final fantasy forums (I used it mainly for the debate forum) b/c everyone there was such a fucking liberal that I just couldn't stand it. I was the only conservative voice. Plus most of them were anti-american brits... go blair, fuck them.  Well, I guess my over-patriotism has increased my abrasiveness. Oh well.   War - Don't like it, wish we didn't need it but we do.   Peace - idealistic, human nature dictates that there will always be a bully   France - hasn't been useful since Napoleon's exile to St. Helena 1815   Gays - Deserve full rights (one of few lib views)   Black people bitchin' about being shipped from africa a while back - send them back to Africa   Illegal Immigrants - still considering this issue   Guantanamo Bay Detainees - shower them with pigs blood and see how many muslims want a peice of the US   Willy Clinton - go away, 8 years is up   Hilary Clinton - you're ugly and I don't want u as prez  See you later space Druid...      Listening must have gone out of style... - 6/27/2003      Well, I have recently recieved a series of 'unhappy people notes' in regards to my neocon entry. One from someone unsigned, and the other 2 from nathril. Either they didn't read what I wrote or just don't understand what sarcasm is... or either. I deleted the notes because reading them almost made me vomit in disgust. However, here were the main complaints that I can remeber without barfing up my guts.   -You shouldn't call Hilary ugly, how vain   that really has nothing to do w/ being a Neocon, just felt like adding that in there. Now if whoever wrote that would be forthcoming with their name I will gladly point out that you can be equally vain.   -dumping blood on muslims! how disgusting, you disgust me!   You know what else is disgusting? Sending muslim extremists over here to kill 2,000+ people, I don't want to see that happen again, whoever left that note, please I'll send you a forward regarding something like that.   -Clinton should be allowed to speak out if he wants   I never said anything about preventing him from speaking, all I said was that he should stop bullshitting his way to a 3 presidential term.  finish this later      The Mission... - 6/28/2003      Some people set goals to lose weight, help out more around the house, or other beneficial things. I however, have chosen a route more suited for my abilities. I have decided that my mission for this summer is to play at least 2 games until their completion. Here is my current schedule:  Start by finishing Shadows of Undrentide, perhaps a few Morrowind or JK2 breaks in between.  After SoU, I will finish my half completed game of Icewind Dale 2... damn crap wizard. During the frustrating impossible areas I shall hope to conqure the world in an chiefton (eziest level) game of Civ III.  After that my mission is to continue questing on morrwind and perhaps gain the patience to complete Jedi Knight 2... it's so fucking impossible, the entire mission concept is stupid. The creators probably said, let's make an extra buck by having our game so counter intuitive that you have to buy the strategy guide. I mean shit, it's stuff like, hop on one leg down the jedi mine field, then throw your lightsaber at the sun all while being dressed like a clown. the multiplayer is fun but I want to fuck the programmers who made the single player up the ass with a metal rod of death.      why am i doing a survey thing? - 7/11/2003      1.

Got pantsed? that was probably spelled wrong, but I may have been once... iduno, maybe      middle fingers are popular, but have one anyway.. - 7/12/2003      Now, I've never been one to randomly get pissed off. Well, i take that back, i'm usually just pissed off all the time. But after having been going consistantly to ffgurus (a forum swarming with abortion addicts, sex fiends and overall thugs), and seeing some random diaries, mostly dedicated to how having sex with eight people and doing drugs simulatneously is fun, I have become VERY pissed at one main thing.   'nonconformists'   Two key points about that term.  A. it mainly applies to goths, bangers and band nerds who have gained either of these mentalities, etc... basically anyone who thinks they are above the 'populars' (these aren't generalizations, just tendencies)  B. The reason it's in quotations, is because the term  nonconformists  is a falactious term that has lost all substance over the years. I will explain this further down.  Am I pissed off because they act a certain way? Yes and no. I would first like to point out, cutting wrists, listening to 'underground music', hating black people music, and being an antisocial, is okay in my book. If you want to act like that, be my fucking guest, I'll prepare a bed for you. But it's not what they do, but it's how they carry themselves. Nearly every single one has this dogma that dictates that if you shop from 'A&amp;E, A&amp;F, Polo, etc' that you are shallow, and have no inner soul. Also, because the  nonconformists  don't wear A&amp;E, they have been elevated to a higher level of thinking, that they have become gods among the hollow, candy coated  populars . (ironically many are atheists).  They also tend to have a skewed sense of what freedom is. Their belief on 'freedom of speech' means that they can say whatever the fuck they want, but if someone told them to be quiet, that's an infringement on their freedom of speech. Here's the thing, to say to another citizen, 'shut up, I have freedom of speech' is a contradiction. I have taken John Stewart Mill's philosophy on freedom.    'freedom is the right to pursue one's own good in one's own way, so long as that pursuit does not infringe on another's right to do the same.'   The first amendment was set in place so that the government couldn't come down and tell you to stop preaching about whatever. It doesn't give choice people the opportunity to say whatever they want while disregarding other people. 'one person's rights end where another's begin'  That misuse of freedom of speech basically generalizes the crux of their mentality. They have been blinded, blinded by their attempts at being different. They have been blinded by flashy words, by the candy exterior, without knowing what's inside, and why... whether or not they are willing to admit to it.  In closing, I am a nerd, I watch anime (i'm listening to anime music right now), game constantly, and have little respect for 'image' or 'social status'. I am neither a  popular , nor a  nonconformist . I understand that I am influenced by external things. I don't dislike  nonconformists  based on their disregard for 'pop culture', or their sometimes radical views on politics. I dislike their belief that they are better than everyone because they shop at hot topic, or spencers. Both sides,  populars  and  nonconformists  hate each other because of their differences. That is to be expected, but goths think they are so damn special. No one is truly different anymore.    'if you've thought of something clever, it's been done at least two times over'           An assortment of useless information... - 7/18/2003      1. How many past relationships have you had? what the hell is a relationships?  2. How many of those do you wish didn't happen? happy birthday to me!  3. How long did your longest relationship last? 3 months... wait, one month... whatever, iforgot  4. How short was your shortest relationship? see above  5. Do you usually date people who have similar personalities as you? well,  ideally, , meaning, in the even that I dated, and had a large amount of fodder, i woudl prefer a beautiful conservative... but I do respect inteligible liberals.  6. Do you kiss on the first date? depends on if the girl has lips i suppose    7. Would you have sex on the first date? Have You before? I am morally opposed    8. Do you get along with most people you meet? everyone who I dont hate  9. Are you a difficult person to be around? Iduno, whoever reads this can answer... please do.  10. Why do you keep a diary? reference for when I grow up. 'a man who thinks the same at age 50 as he did at age 30 wasted 20 years of his life.' Muhammud Ali. I disagree with this and hope that I only increase my maturity, not outlook on life. That's just my dogma though.  11. What's the weirdest habit you have? that I feast on the brains of newborns... I mean, crack my neck constantly  12. Done any illegal drugs? BLOW UP COLUMBIA!!!    13. What was the last illegal thing you have done? its so hard to go 65 on 249, son of a bitch.    14. Favorite place to go when you're feeling down? bathroom, no joke, sitting on the pot is so relaxing.  15. Favorite summer vacation spot? my ass  16. Favorite winter vacation spot? my ass in a blanket    17. Ever taken a cruise? If so, to where? i'm too poor  18. Favorite Disney character? Stripperela... wait, that's tnn.  19. Got any secrets you would like to share? that's why they're secret.  20. If you could have named yourself what would it have been? David... I love that name, he was a jew who killed stuff.  21. Do you usually tell the truth or just what you think they want to hear? well, they being people who ask if they look pretty... truth.  22. Did you or are you planning to attend college? Where did you go? A&amp;M... oh wait, herding cattle and practicing law are different things... my bad    -If you did go to college, who has been the most interesting person you met there? I saw Glenn at the community college one time. CC testing  -Person who has changed your life the most? Ben  -Best college experience? passing the compass test, keeping in mind my college expereiences have been limited to that and the time I had to go pee and there was a fucking window looking right at a bathroom but not a door anyfuckingwhere near it.  23. Would you rather people be just like you, or would you rather be just like someone? Well, yet again brining up my dogma, everyone should be like me, sexy and conservative  24. Do your parents respect you? My mom was a drunk, she used to beat me with an extension cord.  25. Do you respect your parents? depends on the day, and if my dad is reminicing on how he was a 'playa' back in the day.  26. Would your life make a good soap opera? a comedy, not a soap opera.  27. Are you usually in a good mood? probably, only when I'm happy though  28. What is your greatest desire? to have my name remembered long after I die.  29. What is your greatest achievement thus far? none as of yet.  30. Do you know of anybody that is jealous of you? dont know. dont know of anyone reason to be.        And darkness consumed the land... - 7/22/2003        Morality   How does one define such a concept. According to a nameless banger who has no sense between his mop-like head, believes that morality is determined by a higher force, that God ultimatly determines what is right and wrong. Essentially that morality is as tangible, that there is a physical manifestation of what is right and wrong, that being the bible. However, how would this person explain the fact that there are over 5,000 Christian denomonations alone? Are their visions on what is moral skewed? That they have lost sight of what is moral. Who is to decide what is moral or not.  Obviously I believe that Saddam Hussien and his late children were evil people.  Evil . I believe this world is for the most part polar, there is an end to every begining, a good to every evil, morality to imorality. I believe this as I believe the sun in the sky. How can one see the light if not from the shadows; or see the shadows, if not from the light?  Looking back at my classification of Saddam as 'evil'. Is he truly evil? Saddam is no more 'evil' in the truest sense, than I am 'good'. This is because there is no way to determine that someone is evil. The two polar concepts are non-existant on a worldly level. Though I may percieve someone to be evil, my opinion no more effects that person, than would my opinion that gray is the best color.    One Winged Angel   ' Tomball is essentialy a dry well ', Bryan, in regards to possible female companions.  There are two main factors that I look at when deciding upon someone whom I would enjoy spending extended periods of time with on a relationship basis. Each factor is broken up into three components.  As I have stressed repeatedly to Nathril and Ascaril, I need to rent out a lot in the mall and put up a sign calling it 'the anime, gaming and debating store'. That is my 'triforce', I value those things highest. If my girlfriend cannot understand, or appreciate at least one of those, what would I talk about?  Secondly, is my vision on morality. The three prime evils (no, not the ones of uglyness, whole other story... perhaps covered in my next entry), are sex, drugs and alchohol. I now despise these things mainly on Ben's influence. 'the true test of a man's character is the ability not to give into temptation', unknown.    The Irregularity   Cris, I've known her for two years. I love her to death. Though she hates drugs and alchohol as much as I do, she is... sexually open. Despite this, I don't care. When I discovered the Phantom had sex, I began to despise her. Yet Cris is more open than even her. And yet, for some reason it doesn't bother me... It's the damndest thing. I know not if it is love... or somethign else.        When one door closes... - 7/27/2003      ... yeah, you're pretty much fucked if you don't open it back up  I would like to start this entry off (which I began writing at aproximatly 3:07 CSTam) with a reference to PA.    ----------   Gabe: 'Hey everybody... I'm up. I' awake. So what is this? What are we doing? Who is this guy?  Guy: 'I'm Will Wright, you're interviewing...'  Gabe: 'Okay, okay, okay.  Shh . Listen. We're going to play a little game, it's called Sim Get Me Some Fucking Coffee,  fucker . Fuck you!  Fuck , it's early.  Tycho: 'And they canceled your show... just like that?  Gabe: 'I know, what the fuck?'    ----------   Now, I'm so fucking tired right now I shall be afuckingmazed if anyone can interpret this bullshit as actual human writing. If not... then I'll look back and realize sleep is needed. Of course I'll probably keep gaming or something, but I'll have thought of it at least. And isn't it the thought that counts? No... no it is not.  Back to my story which wasn't quite finished off... and has had some additions... and that I am writing right now. Okay, so about Cris. As I may or may have not addressed, she is currently going out with someone. Now, in my humble opinion, he's kinda tool. He has absolutly no sense of humor, listens to bad music, and is overall, very unhappy. (jake, he's the guy we met when we went over to her house and he was really quiet because he's not friendly... yeah, you remember him... or else) So after having informed her of my feelings for her, keeping in mind that at the time he was basically telling her he was falling out of love for her, she's depressed and other crap, she goes 'well I have a boyfriend'. Woah, i'm really fucking tired. So essentially she tells taylor (name of boyfriend) that I asked her out, as a result he starts reappreciating her (that's barely a word) and now I'm back to square one.  Today I planned on calling her and giving her some speech thing about this that and some other crap which escapes my memory for the time being. It was just going to be some, you know, I just dont like the I cant wait forever crap. However, I thought to myself, that being very much like me, she'd probably do the 'oh, well okay' apathetic crap which is what I always do when placed in a similar situation. So instead, I just said, 'ya know, calling you and telling you to break up w/ him and telling you taht i love you won't make a damn bit'a difference, so whenever you break up, give me a call.' That was it except for some other rhetoric.  I doubt I'll actually care if/when she calls though. I mean quite frankly, I just don't feel like trying right now. Holy crap im' tired.  See you later space... shit i'm tired          Azurewrath... - 8/5/2003      okay, so I've been thinking. Jake and I write similarly in this sense. After you read the entry, you kind of scratch your head and wonder what the fuck is that. the reason for me is because I write off into so many different angles its hard to understand if there was actually a point. usually, there is not. for jake, it is because he uses so many adjetives, and other poetic things that it turns into... well a giant ass poem. Example of how I write compared to jake:  [bryan]  okay, so here's the thing, I got pissed off at work today because my friend f**king backstabbed me and made me feel like my pants were on fire... WHILE IM IN THE CRAPPER, I mean what the hell?  [/bryan]  [jake]  Today, as I entered the work place, betrayal cast a shadow into the room, as one who I once considered to be a friend, an ally snuck up behind me and drew a blade, which was aimed at my back side. The blade drew blood, for its name was betrayal, and lies. the blood poured from my soul as the transverlesence (made up word) of my existance was sapped away like a fly enjoying a snack before its death brought on by humanity.  [/jake]  So there you have it. and just for fun, this entry will be twice as long because for every paragraph I write like myself, it shall be written like jake.    In the begining   [bryan]  Does anyone remember POP youth? Yeha, i do, and it sucked few years ago. as of recent I remember hwo I need community service to fill in for the gap chemistry and alg 2 left this year... DAMN YOU WINDOW!!! So I go back to join the 'club' again. First time I fell in love with shell... yeah, that fucked up huh? yeah... it did. So this time, I'm finding myself attracted to this other chick, tiffane'... yes the ''' is actually part of her name, what the fuck? My main concern, is that it'll either fuck up, or not work... which is the same as fucking up consequently. Btw, I fell outa love w/ cris... i am not a man of patience.  [/bryan]  [jake]  Looking back to a time of joy, and sadness, I recollect my actions at the community of prince of peace. There was much sucking that transpired on those fateful days... how I weep for my time wasted in the abysmal place that it was... and for a part... is. The void caused by my unforgiving grades in chemistry and algebra 2, I suppose, must be filled with something else... so i now assume that the filler of thsi void must be community service... DAMN YOU WINDOW!!! As a result of this void of ultimate despair, I return to the partially abysmallic (possibly a made up word) to aquire a healthy bonus to my resume'. Among my recollections of the abyss, were the epochs I spent attempting to find the heart of the one I loved so dearly, that being the heart of michell, which turned to stone, and then to (cold Item #103 not found). The time chasing this heart most unfortuantly... was time wasted, time which shall never return to me for it was stolen by the (greek god #391 not found) and who keeps it close to her. However, my eyes are now open to a new heart which I am currently in pursuit of. The name of venus at my church, is Tiffane'. The only fear that dwells in my pain wrought heart, is the ultimate fear, the fear that my love will vanish, like a breath in the cold winter wind, upon which love is breathed. Cris, has fallen from the locker which I hold my caring for. Patience is weak in this rusty locker of DOOM!  [/jake]  2 Side notes, Azurewrath, is the name of Tyreal's holy sword in Diablo 2. And ICH BIN DER KONIG!!! AUS KEINE HOSEN... yeah, ido speak a little nazi...  See you later space... uh, crap factory?      A delightful game of guess who... - 8/7/2003      Yes, the game today is guess who... is being a major cockass. The way this works is, I shall give my audience 2 hints regarding who this person is. Whoever notes first with the correct answer, wins... nothing most likely, i'm too damn poor.   Hint #1: This person has a name  Hint #2: That name is Bret Machelek  now, most of you... yeah, most of nathan, haha. Is probably wondering how exactly Bret is being a cockass. Well, he informed me about 2 days into my employment at rib tickler that I only have one channel, such that I act the same in almost every place. He on the other hand has three, one for school, church and work. This has been all the more apparent as of recent however. He really has been nothing but an absolute asshole for the last week or so. He constantly reminds me how it took me 3 weeks until sylvia allowed me to do drive through alone, and rubs it in my face in attempt to make me feel,  lesser . He also overly exagerates the time I asked him to helpe me cut bannanas. I cannot do it fast, there's probably some trick to it, and iwanted to know hwo. He, in his 'rib tickler divinity' assumed that I asked him how to cut a bannana. Now, if he just fucks around with me, i really dont care. but when he does it around sylvia, who now treats me as she would a sub human, i tend to get a little pissed off. Obviously i'm pissed off about those things. But i'm really fucking furious about what he said to heather, his current girlfriend. Keeping in mind the fact, that the entire time he was gone on jesus vacation, I was telling heather to go out with him and what a great guy he was. Obviously they started going out, its all good ya know? A week after that she heads off to some lake place... terrible memory. So I would call her every other day or so because I think she's a great friend. When she got back and she came into rib tickler for a brief period, she came by and gave me a hug and started talking to me. iduno why, me being the least threatening person, but bret apparently got jealous or something, and told heather NOT to talk to me. Regardless, we had a long discussion regarding what a fuck head he's been the night following. The ironic thing is, he was pissed off at paul, her last boy friend because paul was too needy, and wouldnt let anyone else be with her. Despite this, bret would always hug and kiss her. Bret is now a fucking ass cocking hypocrit who eats dick, shit and a variety of other things that are unmentionable.  perhaps having just one channel makes me less flexible, and not as many people will like me, but I feel like I do less alienating whenever I just act like myself. The way i see it, I should change my environment, not let my environment change me.  See you later space S.W.A.T. team...      Captain Your Mom Bitch... - 8/8/2003      I recently left a note on jake's diary. The content is absurd and after having reread it, i want to vomit in disgust. It has occured to me that for the most part, I am a random person. However, that leads me to believe that my  random  nature, has lead me to be quite dependable in that sense. To put it frankly, you can count on me to do some frivolously random thing. I still maintain that if you use the correct algorithm you could basically track my zillion trains of thought, such that if during a discussion about food consumption I interject why I think cartman is a funny guy, you would easily be able to determine why I said that. Here, let me demonstrate, (keeping in mind, this scenario is a real life thing):  Food consumption = poop  poop = dooty in the river  dooty in the river = recollection of mr. hankie  mr. Hankie = south park  south park = cartman  So though I may say random things, they are not necissarly as random as possible. And if you ask me to just say a random word, you may notice that if you make me do it enough, i'll just cycle through the same words/numbers. Though I'm not thinking as clearly as I would... if i was able to think clearly, I am thinking of some commonly used 'random words/numbers'  12, a gazillion, hojillion, 5, eat poop  watermellon, dooty, boobies, Hoo Ah, and a variety of other crap I dont care to mention.  Ironically enough, that reminds me of something else. I tend ot say the same dumb phrases over and over again. in fact, I usually catch myself saying them while in conversation, for absolutly no reason at all. Which reminds me of how shannon, for 2 consecutive years has eaten with me and either jake or nathan, and each year has explained how she needs to get new friends. It will be interesting to see if this year is actually any different in any way shape and or form.  Phrases:  'which reminds me' -often, what was previously said reminded me of nothing, I just felt like adding something in.  'you see, the thign is' -used almost at every time i'm ready to make a point, keep in mind hand gestures are usually highly active  'Keeping in mind' -used to sp ecify something or another  'now obviously,' -i'm probably doing this in a condescending way... dumb liberals... haha, i'm just joking, I mainly use it on people like the lords of evil... yeah, you know 'em.  'Your mom' -actually, I dont even say that much anymore.. comparitvly anyway  'Hoo ah' -no explanation needed  'the moral of the story is' -said whenever wrapping up a speech of some sort and wish to throw in a last bit of nonsesible horse crap  So, it is in my opinion that your mom needs to good night!      The Master Sword... - 8/11/2003        I just love when you get The Master Sword lv3 from the fat fairy under ganon's temple... it's got such a powerful *Swoosh*, it's like the heavens bow before it   Yep, so we're going out now.

I mean, its like someone came down here and just deep fried their already simian brains. Now, i'm willing to bet some of you... yet again, some of nathan, have interpreted that I am angry. And yes, I am most furious right the fucking now damnit bitch. My parents really have no idea what the hell their doing, seriously. This is their idea of punishment.  *mother comes into bryan's room playing a computer game when he has work to do*  Mom, 'that's it bryan, I'm taking away your cell phone... that'll teach you to play on your computer'  Bryan expresses a blank stare, then turns to rage, 'what hte hell? why would you take away my cell phone?'  Mom returns a 'are you dumb' look, 'Well duh, i'm teaching you a lesson, you'll thank me some day'  Bryan scratches head and looks at the ground, 'mom... the computer and cell phone are two completely different things.'  Mom tilts head and does classic scooby doo 'huh?'  And then my car is taken away whenever I talk on the phone too much.. What the hell, I think they're taking the 'head up ass' approach at parenting. I've been under this sort of thing my whole life. Ironically enough, my cell phone and car have been  temporarily  suspended. I really have no ifuckingdea when they will be returned. Seriously, what the fuck is this??? I'm so agoddamn pissed off right now i could either do something like... get angry, or even yell a little bit. well, i asked brent if i could get aride with him, he said yes but noooooooooooo i cant ride w/ him the first fucking day. I really think my dad's head is so far up his ass, he's eating shit, which goes into his stomach which is then eaten again. Thus, he's just in a big cycle of eating shit essentially. I really can't fucking wait to get to fucking college. No fuckin lie.  In synopsis, my parents are assholes. 'nuff sed.

First day of my junior year of High School, and what a day it's been. No fucking joke, well, here's the run down for my classes that I had today... damn that stupid 6period a day thing.  Period I, Debate 2:   Pros:   Seriously, this will epitomize my happiness this year. I've already had more fun in one day than a barrel of venom spitting cobras.   Cons:   That one damn senior for some reason either hates me or is merely iritated by me, possibly both... also the class is only every other day, damnation  Period III, Pre-cal PAP:   Pros:   Rand is in my class... 'nuff sed   Cons:   It's a math class... 'nuff sed  Period IV, History CC:   Pros:   PRAISE GOD ALMIGHTY, I have Ben in my class... the teacher seems to be conservative for the most part and knows my brother which may come as a plus   Cons:   But for Ben and me, it's filled with a bunch of crazy ass liberals who really couldnt point out the american flag in a store that sells only american flags, oh and the teacher is insanely feminist. Not that I have anything against women having equal rights, i just don't think they deserve to vote or work... hahaha, just joking, i'm sipmly afraid i'll say some semi-chauvanistic remark and get sent to jail.  Period V, Phyisics:   Pros:   'well, look on the bright side... you're soaked in urine'   Cons:   BOOOOOOOORING, nothing but a bunch of morons in class who measure their success on how many bitches they can knock up in one sitting. heh... nuff sed  Period VI, Comm Aps:   Pros:   I enjoy speaking... alot   Cons:   It seems errily familiar to my debate class last year, not a bridge i'd like to cross again... 'nuff sed  Period VII, English III CC:   Pros:   Eh, I think i enjoy english, plus the course is based on writing which i sort of like, but for the stuff i dont like writing... damn procrastination   Cons:   The teacher seems sort of like the lord of Insanely liberal and stupid comments and uglyness... ironically enough she's also in my class...

'A Total Ass Raping Cock Captain...' - 8/15/2003      Yep, that senior from debate, taylor, is 'a total ass raping cock captain'... nuff sed      Fate is Fickle... - 8/21/2003      I... am a selfish.  I want... a woman who understands me.  I really need... a companion, to share my troubles with.    Fate it seems... is not without a sense of irony.  ~Morpheous   Darkness had consumed my heart for the longest time. Finally, not but a week and three days ago had light peirced it. Not only had I gained the courage to ask someone out, they accepted. I suppose however, the entire situation was doomed from the start. Though I say this almost every day, i'm just not charasmatic. Praise and Worship (praying through singing and clapping) just isnt my thing. In fact, I hate it with a passion. She on the other hand loved it, P&amp;W is her favorite thing to do. That may seem like some immaterial thing, but it roots deeper in my primary reason for why I want a companion. 'for no one else but me', damnit, what's a companion more than a title if they aren't close to your heart? I long for one so that I can just hold them when I'm feeling down, and despite what the world thinks, I'm not always smiling. I long for one so that when she's had a bad day at school, I can hold her. That is not... no, was not her style.  Beach Retreat... 2 years ago, I feel in love with Michelle. This year, I suppose I feel out of love with my companion. In the forty eight hours there, we probably spent thirty minutes truly alone together. If we would sit down to listen to a speech, she would go by her friends, walking right past me. I would look at her from across the room, laughing and having fun. Nothing crushes me more than that. Not to say that I dont want her happy, or to have friends, but I want to be apart of that. I hate exclusion. The bus trip home, she didn't sit by me, much less speak with me. If any of you know the pain you get when your hopes, dreams and passion, is crushed in an instant, you know my pain. There is no pain equal to seeing the one you love laughing and hugging another guy. Even if they're just friends.  One hour.  From the time I got off the bus, until bible study, my gut was going through some of the most intense suffering I have ever expereienced. The feeling matched few times in my life. At bible study I planned to confront her with this, and explain to her why i feel this way, why I'm so fucking selfish, why it kills me to see her away from me. But she gets in the first word. Or phrase for that matter. ' Let's be friends '. What a fucking joke, what a fucking insane joke that is. For really, how can I look at her the same as I would some random girl, or even as a friend of many years. It's imfuckingpossible. There is one thing I hate in this world above most things. It is pouring yourself into a hole. Or into something that is unsubstantial. I poured my love (and 20 dollars, fuck that was expensive nail polish) into an hole. Darkness has consumed my heart once more...    Just fade... fade away...        Bastards!

I have chosen a mirror. I think my valley of shittyness has reached a new low. Meh, I think this just happens at the beggining of each year. But who do I turn to?  -Nathan, something has happened. he has changed... i once thought i could talk to him about anything. now quite the opposite is true.  -Jake, our scope of conversation doesn't venture far past anime and porn... or both.  -Ben/Bret, i'm not part of the debate team i'm in it. I'm not a part of work, i just show up. somehow this summer has fuzed the two at the nuts.  -Shannon, iduno, summer of '02 was the peak i guess.  -Cris, i guess Gin and juice the reremix has occured, we are not on speaking terms. Why? b/c her boyfriend is just like i am.  -Calvin, ... why did i even write that?  -PoP youth group, that's laughable  -God, it seems every time i give thanks for something, I get fucked over.  -Tiffane', oh wait, she's part of PoP, hahahahaha (fuck PoP)  .... wow, i dont have that many friends  I've turned to so many people, I've done a complete 360 going back to myself.  No man is an island . Fuck it, i'm a damn rock. Quite frankly, i'm pissed off, i hate work, i hate school, and sad to say, i hate debate. No fucking lie. Ever since i walked into that class, i'ts been debate one all over again. Ridicule and ostracizing. Key difference, now its from my 'friends' and the ass raping cock captain. Derocher seems genuinly concerned, but yet again, i get blamed for thigns others dont. exp: my group laughs when someone presents a point so absurd i'm sure a baby died somewhere as a result. The bitch tells D that we shouldnt laugh at her, so we, specifically I, get bitched out. Ironically enough, when I was talking, the same person was either ignoring me the whole time or laughing, yet when icommented on this, I was mocking her. What the fuck?  Let's do the run down of my fucking gay fucking schedule:  1. debate, shitty, shitty more shit  2. nazi 2, i hate nazis, nuff sed  3. precal, i have rand, funny class, gay work  4.

Btw, apparently by not viewing germany as the dominant nation in this world, i am a 'pain in the ass' so says some fascist.  6. comm aps, that class is like debate I in content, same stupididty, different stupid people... i'm apparently funnier in there though... 'hop on the flow dog'  7. english, cant fucking wait to get outa school at that point in time.  As for debate team, i'm basically a lesser person in there because i'm not part of the 'officers'. fuck that, fuck the world, and fuck you too. Do you know how much it hurt me when i found out that i am basically a nobody in the team? well, if you guessed alot or higher, you are correct.  PoP, i'm so fucking afraid of failing matt, you have no ifuckingdea. It's worse than my fear of... well not cockroaches, holy shit it was flying EVERYWHERE... but it's dead now.  Rib Tickler, fuck my shitty hours, fuck my shitty pay, fuck the fucking motherfucking world.  Your mom bitch!      Battousai the Manslayer... - 9/1/2003      well, many of you are wondering how this title came into being. The topic for tonight is Stagnation and its greatness. That made me think of a quest in the game Diablo where Cain the elder explained how the rivers ran stagnant. And what's one of the best swords in that game? The grandfather, which happens to be a katana. and who uses katanas? None other than Samurai X, Kenshin Himura, otherwise known as, Battousai the manslayer. Random, no. Algorithmically sound.    Stagnation   I had an epiphany moment as I exited 249 after work on Saturday. It was around 9 O'clock, and I was actually content, which is unusual having just come back from work. It's dark out, the music is up loud, and somehow the right turn signal comes on, I pull out of 249, onto spring cypress. As I am doing this, I realized something. There was no thought involved. It was a routine action i've preformed a hundred times before, and shall do a thousand more. And then it smacked me in the face. Why i sucked at work for the longest while, why this year is really pissing me off, why I'm a terrible driver. It all suddenly clicked. I seem to pick up on things very slowly, if at all, but when I do, it becomes natural, like breathing. I live my life passivly, moving by through routine, and when something changes, i am forced to change. Thus, i go out of my routine. Though I may not be exciting by any accounts, i am far more level headed than my brother for example. Idont get pissed off but a few times every now and again. But that in and of itsself is routine. I'm trying to write fast so cpt PBP can read it before his bed time, lol.  So why am I pissed off? Because, during the summer, Ben and i couldnt be closer... well, if he was a hot girl... maybe. But when he started working w/ me, everything changed. He and bret buddied up at the nuts, and now i'm '3/7's of a person' according to Ben. I prefer things to stay the same, even if they suck, because I like something dependable. Which is why i hate Austen and people like him. He can't stay in one mood for mroe than a minute.  See you later space porn director...        The Drunkening... - 9/9/2003      And no, i'm not quite sure if that is or is not a word. A discussion with Jageitay Bellajur, Drew, and Nate, really explained to me why it is that i'm glad to not be in the 'in' crowd. If there is one thing that really makes me sick to my stomach, it is underage drinking. It sickens Jake, and is morally unsound to Ben, both are true for me. go 18th amendment. Nathan on the other hand, who I would consider to be a vagrant among the cliques nowadays, considers it humorous, and even to a smaller extent applauds those people who get drunk off their ass. I recall one time in english when Jared wsa explaining how he got Stephanie Gomez to wave at him in the hall. Bare in mind, she is physically attractive, I have also come to the understanding that she is not the peak of morality in my opinion. I personally could care less if a hot person took notice of me, for my undying philosophy is that action yields similar action. If I have to try hard to get someone to take notice of me, I'm not going to try at all. I wouldn't consider anyone in that crowd above me, nor I above them... well, maybe.  for being someone who talks endlessly, it's difficult to say that I find it hard to explain my utter disgust for obscene alcholic consumption. I believe it's partly because I don't even know why people do it. I can't fathom why someone would subjigate their body to physical torture, kill brain cells, and in the case of someone who will remain unnamed, suffer alchohol posioning. I can't understand why if someone chooses not to drink, they emerse themselves in alchoholism, ignorance, darkness. I must not be openminded enough to question the sheer joys of throwing up at 3 in the morning, or being forced to clean up someones excriments and vomit while being hung over. (reference to my brother's friend's bachelor party, he's not a drunk, just drinks socially, not that I approve) I probably just need to expand my mind to the incomprehensible pleasure of losing my mind.  Losing my mind, one thing I cannot do. That must be it. That must be why I hate drinking. The thought of not being at 100%, or anywhere near that is unsettleing. Intoxication disgusts me, it frightens me, and if that is the prerequisite to being put in a group of popular people, then I am more than happy to be apart of the 'nerd clique'. I'm happy to know that debating and speech is my strength, and that i'm not ashamed to admit that.  I think Nathan's desire to become an openminded person, to alter his inital mentality that preps are the spawn of Diablo, he has become one, or at least, a part of him has. Now, I never agreed with his mental crusade on the preps, I felt them equal to any other clique. Damn fucking drunks.    'You speak of knowledge, Judicator? You speak of experience? I have journeyed through the darkness between the most distant stars. I have beheld the births of negative-suns and borne witness to the entropy of entire realities...' - Zeratul      The Vagrant... - 9/11/2003      I would like to state first and foremost that this entry, and all others written in my diary are based on my opinion, and my outlook on the world. In the event that you disagree, I apologize that you do not see eye to eye with me, but I cannot help that. So don't get pissed off and cry.  You know what's been pissing me off lately? Debate. I swear to fucking gosh, it's become a shit hole. not that I havnt addressed that recently, but i'm really in a fucking bad mood. I'm pissed off for two different reasons completly, however, both are related directly to debate.  Firstly, the damn officer thing. I think that the way officers were 'elected', if you could even call it that, was done entirly by black magic. Let me do the run down of who is what of the four differnet officers.  President: Ben  Vice: Bret  Cpt of Speech: kassie  Cpt of Debate: Shannon  I agree completely that ben should be pres, he has more nfl points than the next four runners up. And shannon, well, it's a copmlicated matter that, granted she is better than me. Well, on one hand, Bret is Vice president. Obviously he has been in debate longer than me. But it is in my honost opinion that he is not that great at debate, he has barely 20 more points than me, and has been in debate a year longer. On the other hand, Kassie is head of speech. speech events include: prose, poetry, oratory, extemp and basically everything non-LD or CX debate. The ONLY thing she does, is prose. I on the other hand have done extemp, prose and oratory before. So I fail to see how she is this omnipotent person in that sense.  Now, if the whole officer schpeal was the same as last year, the lack of being an officer would only slightly piss me off. But no, last year being an officer was just a pretty title. This year, they have their own fucking 'office' which is little more than a bunch of pens in the smaller practice room, and there are all these fucking 'officers only meetings' which piss the fuck outa me. It's like, i'm not even their friends anymore. which for the most part is true now.  btw, Kassie isnt a star debater herself either.  Secondly, is the way Ms. D treats me. In the event that I was to pick up one of shannon's pens in order to flow something, she'd jump on my back and start carving out my neck. Conversly, and this is a true story mind you, Bret, at the last tournament (5-6 of september 2003), Bret had siezed not only my jacket but also my briefcase while I was away. He had changed the combination on it, thus making it impossible for me to open for a time. He then proceeds to waltz over to follow Ms. D in my jacket, and swinging my briefcase in the air. In all honosty, I think the value of the briefcase and suit jacket alone far exceeds shannon's pen or backpack, and yet she says nothing to Bret. When he got out my Risk board and started fucking aroudn with it, she said nothing. If he was going ot play a game, i coulda cared less, but he was just fucking the little soldiers, and i'm sure he lost several. Ms. D doesn't even give it a fucking thought. Because she basically demonstrated no respect for me at all during that tournament, I, in response did not yield her any. I basically piddled around and was unresponsive to whatever she asked of me. Keeping in mind i only started doing this after the flailing around of my Jacket occured.  I've resolved to never bring Risk again.  But it doesn't stop there. Bret, as I've mentioned before, seems to enjoy bringing up eveyrone of my shortcomings at work, be it my fear of giant bugs, or lack of common sense. He doesnt stop. And it has been going on for as long as we've been in school. Now, similarly as the ms. D resopnse, I dont get mad, I get even. So thinking back to when Heather told me about how he was making out w/ this one girl. (side note: this girl is the ugliest thing alive. I dont even rate her in regards to Angie simply because she wasn't entirly human). So, I figure I may as well bring that up to Bret, because apparently everything that occurs in the workplace is fair game. Bret saw it differently, he got so pissed off and said, 'i dont like bringing that up'. He excused his unrelenting attacks on me as 'payback for when I brought up the 'buff, witty and good looking' note'. Yet again, vengeance is a double edged sword.    '... And so the greatest warrior had his blood poured into a sword, armor and cloak; so that he could vanquish evil... even after death.'   The Tale of the Vengeance Suit        The Sword of Vengeance... - 9/12/2003        '... The Sword of Vengeance has two sides, one of pure white, to represent that it must be wielded by one with a pure heart, and that it's purpose is to vanquish evil. The other side, is pure black, to represent that there is evil in all things, and those who succumb to sin, become sin...'   Now, it's in my opinion that cruelty yeilds cruelty, and kindness yeilds kindness. Nathan refuted this, not that i was surprised, however, this is a principle I will stick to. For the past five weeks, my character has been attacked, my ethics, and the way I present myself. Kick me in the balls once... i'll fall on the ground and cry. Do it a second time, and the same thing will occur... but the third time!!! I'll get up and kick you in the balls. Sure, nathan says how i act gay, and on other occasions am dumb. But the tri-attack shit just doesn't bode will with me. So, i've decided to present my opinion on bret and ben, based on their character, ethics and presentation. Obviously i'm writing this down because I have a terrible memory and, well, it's on my damn mind.  Character:  Bret- Seriously, he made out with the UGLIEST female ever. His justification, 'I was desperate', what, the fuck? That's foul under any circumstances.  Ben- gossip, i can only imagine what is said about me when my back is turned.  Ethics:  Bret- I'm a racist because I say 'nigga'. Which, according to Ben and Bret, is not a commonly used word anymore. Who listens to rap? Oh yeah, me. I'm sorry, but I'm friends with so many black people its not even funny, shannon is a great friend, and I think Raul is hilarious. So I'm not sure what ethnic group I don't like. White people maybe?  On the other hand, Bret is not what I'd consider to be a shining light of morality or ethical standards either. The fact that he didn't feel his relationship with heather was moving 'fast enough' in the sexual sense, or the fact that he jumps from girlfriends on a weekly basis, is a clear indicator of promescuity. Secondly, he seems to be drinking and smoking more frequently than not, maybe not to get drunk, but drinking is still drinking in my opinion.  Ben- He's anti-Catholic. That in and of itsself is shitty enough. Dont care what religion, anti-anyreligion, is not only immoral, but dumb.  Presentation:  Bret- A Judas to the last drop of blood. He would constantly tell me at work how he always talked me up and shit. And yet, no matter how close you are to someone at one point, stabbing in the back changes the whole situation. Judas was buddies w/ Jesus... until he betrayed him. Not just to me, but wherever he is, his back turns another way. When the people were making fun of Ben at work (they said he was gay and a prick), bret would say, 'yeah, well, pretty much'. I on the other hand defended him, even when jake and heather thought he was an introverted prick.  Ben- about at charasmatic as a crab  Btw, nate, thanks for the humor comment, I try... I try        Roac Spoke, and the Whole World Heard... - 9/15/2003      I'd really like to know when my personal thoughts and feelings which I choose to put on the internet have become a great source for information. I was told recently, by note ironically, that I need to stop talking about people on my Open Diary where everyone can see it. 2 things about that, one serious, one not.  Serious: There are 2 relativly consistant readers I have, Nate and Jake (I think jake goes to the sparknotes version, but o well). I don't really consider writing down emotions I have trouble expressing verbally to my friends, ' ...saying this on an opendiary for everyone to read... '  Unserious: This isn't an Open Diary, those cost money, I have a FREE Open Diary.  In all honosty, I don't go around school, or anywhere I go for that matter handing out cards to my FOD, in fact, there are about 6-7 people who even knew I had one before I began writing about this conflict. Now it's like, maybe 9-10. Fact of the matter is, no one really cares what I think. Though I like to act differently, my opinion, or insight on someone is not going to make that drastic a change. Especially if few people actually read it. If however, I do attempt to degrade someone's character, it is either common knowlege, which was addressed recently, or I do it in retaliation, which is what the recent events are encompassing. I'd like to reiterate the fact that not only have I been called a racist to my face, but also people have made this accusation to my teachers, tell me then, how is that not speaking ill, truthfully or not. By the way, I don't really think I'm a racist. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I could work at rib tickler which is staffed mostly by mexicans (and yes, they do ask to be called this), or in my comm apps class in which there are like five black kids whom I converse with the most out of the class.  All in all, Sara, I retract my use of the word bitch to describe you. I was not mad at you, in fact, I felt bad for having laughed during ya'lls speech, what I am mad about, and always get pissed off about, is when Derocher shows sympathy towards one person, or favors someone, but does quite the opposite to another. I am not a fan of favortism. Life's a bitch.  See you later space tv show host...        A Bunch of Shit... - 9/18/2003      Did you know if you put 'Poop' in the diary search for titles, it comes up with 65 different diaries? How crazy is that. Having looked that up may be one of the reasons I have yet to complete my english paper. Damnation!  Go in the peace of God my friends.  Shit.      Meditation... - 9/21/2003      just for the hell of it, 1:12 am  I'm pissed off for two reasons right now... among the other things. I suppose these two ideas are just stuck in my mind, eating away at what's left of my soul. (well shit, i'm talking Jake now). The damned thing of it is, this entry will probably make people laugh when it's not supposed to.  Okay, I would like to point out that I'm not very serious. There are probably about 2 times that I can be serious, in a debate round (i'm laughing or bitching in class and dancing around at tourneys), and probably when i'm asleep. Consequently, I am never serious, and always a big pile of happy to everyone i'm around. Fact of the matter is, i get pissed off, frustrated, stressed out, and unhappy relativly frequently. And yet, when I try to express this, or convey this to someone, I end up forcing my self to laugh. To make sure no one thinks i'm pissed off. That is a character flaw, I'll be the first to admit that. But the fact that no one can look past my smile and think, 'hmm, maybe Bryan is a tad pissed right now, maybe he's deeper than that'. Nope, i'm just a candy coated person, candy on the outside, happy crap on the inside. Sonsofbitches  Secondly is the fact that i'll probably never find someone who matches me. Someone who I'd actually want to create my legacy with. I have yet to meet (almost spelled meat) a girl who meets my strict requirements. And you know what, who cares if they are dreadfully strict, that's the reason people get so many divorces, because they fuck someone and need to get married, or want to fuck someone so get married. I want to find my perfect fit, i dont want that divorce bullshit. 'Sides, why waste your life on someone who's almost perfect? Fact of the matter is, everyone in tomball, or at least that i've seen, is either a drunken whore, a sex whore, a hang out with people other than me whore, or a all of teh above whore. Sonsofbitches    'Angels banished from heaven have no choice but to become demons...', Vicious of the Red Dragon   1:27 am        Courage... - 9/28/2003         'This is courage... to bear unflinchinglywhat heaven sends.'  â¢Euripides     After conversing with Kaitlyn, and reading this website  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/vt2/g_hols/Niceguy . It really is true. It's what really what I've gone through this last year, with Cris, and to a lesser extent Tiffane'. I really can't wait till I see her next. I'll be like, ' hey Tiff, i didnt recognize you being fondled by a horde of men at your ass. '. Which really was the case in the bareset sense. I mean seriously she couldn't stay offa a guy, (not me mind you) for more than a second, she'd like jump from guy to guy. It was sad really, that iwent out with her. Now, I think Pam is a fox, and she's very moral, and apparently a genius (first in her class, holy shit). On the other hand, I think she's too, out there, as in out there, out of my arms. So if we did go out, it would be Tiffane' all over again, which I really couldn't bare. I dont like feeling my stomach consume itsself.     I apologize nathan for the lack of hilarity.    I swear though, as I said to Kaitlyn who I asked to homecoming (not confirmed yet... doubtful), i know i'll find someone in the end, its just i'll be getting the dirty laundry of five guys over. five assholes. damn assholes.      ' enough strength can defeat anything, even death ', Unknown.     I like that quote not because i'm strong physially, but mentally. And i feel that is a hindrance, example, i'm not influenced by religion as much as most people are. I'd actually like to go to stubenville south to see if God actually can work through me... I suppose that will be my ultimate test.      ' A hero is not the strongest fighter, but the one who can bring an army together ', Talanari     How I wish i could accomplish my goals through the help of others. I want to create a 'penny arcade 2', but without the help of others, it wont get done. I wont get the help of others.

'May you all go with God's protection...'        Pornography at its best... - 9/30/2003        Today, during my few concious moments, I came to three realizations. Firstly, how Nate and I are so different. Secondly, why I dont want to be mad at Bret, but sitll am. And lastly, why I dont like final fantasy tactics as much as I did the first one.    Stagnation, that represents me. I am very stubborn, I dont like admitting i'm wrong. Ever. I also have great sentimental value attatched to my games. Plus I dont feel like selling them back for 3 dollars when teh stores make 27 dollars profit when they resell them. I love gaming, I have not, nor will not return any game I purchase.    Change, that represents nathan. He sells his games constantly, I just dont get that. There is not one game I own that I wouldnt want to pick up some time andjust play it. Even if its just for a few seconds. Worms 2, i love blwoing up worms, jedi knight 2, i love killing shit with a lightsaber. And diablo 2 just is a badass game for 20 minutes. I dont thikn what he does is wrong, or stupid, its just the opposite of what I do... which in a sense makes it wrong and stupid. Just joking, that's just my dogma kicking in.    Bret and I are very similar. Howevver, he has done me wrong and until he admits that we shall not be on speaking terms. Ben on the other hand was a better friedn than him for a time. but he just acts like a dumb cunt every time i talk to him. And because I know that at one point the two fo them are going to read this and bitch at me, or about me, I'd like to express my confusion. Seriously, they bitcha t and about me because I put this shit online. who gives a flying fuck, I havnt seen any military action taken against them on the behalves of those who read this, that being like 3 or 4 preople on a semi regular basis. Especially when they tell more people about the situation at hand than I do. I think its got danged stupid if you ask me.    Tactics. Seriously, the first one was such a badass game. Ramza was a freaking timemage/knight. Unstopable. The difference betweenn tactics for hte psx and gba is how you roleplya. In the psx version I was Ramza, I played a knight fighting for reasons that I cannot devulge for the sake of Jake who may yet play the game. In the gba version, I play the role of Marche, who is playing the role of somebody playing a final fantasy game. ITs like playing agame about playing a game. and yyes, as nathan pointed out, i dont like it because its not exactly like the original. But damnation, aren' t classics usually better than refurbished versions othings? I dont like the fact that it's practically impossible to level up jobs, and the way you do seems very stupid to me. I dont like the fact that If you heal yoruself, and yo'ure already at full HP, you gain more exp than you do for slaughtering someone in one hit that's one level under you. But do I hate the game? Well, I'll beat it and tell you. DAMNATION!    In conclusion, dont do drugs, or you may end up destroying the universe.    PS. those yearbook pictures are fucking hifuckinglarious...        Resolved That... - 10/8/2003         'Whores are stupid bitches', Because I agree w/ this quote by myself, I affirm the resolution      Resolved That: In the United States social system, Bryan's hating whores ought to take precedence over their need to piss me the fuck off.   I would like to offer some key terms to better clarify the resolution using whatever shit i pull out of my ass.    United States social system : the social system in teh United States    Bryan : what a fucking stud    hating:  the action in which one dislikes    whores : basically someone who pisses me off    precedence : bigger, like a penis, but in regards to standards    need to piss me the fuck off : like PMS, only once a day.   The value on which I will uphold in today's debate is that of  minority rights , that being the right of me, who happens to be a minority of one.   The criterion by which i shall measure this value is that of  stupid bitches piss me off.      Contention I : Tiffane's friend ashlee' is a troll.    Sub point A : According to BT Honeycutt of THS, 'seriously, she looks like something out of icewind dale. when the world does change, my party will have to use fire to slay her'. According to this entirlylegitimate source, we can understand the frustration and whoreocity that is present in any conversation with a whore such as Ashlee'. Thus, to negate the resolution establishes a haven for whores and bitches alike. Affirming the resolution allows for less bitching which detracts from good moods and sexual stimulation.    Contention II : If a fucking rock fell on her fucking head, i'd probably fucking laugh... out loud, with my mouth.    Sub point A : During a recorded conversation between  Sir Bryan  and Ashlee' Troll Chieftan, she began to banter and bryan and discredit his flexibility, ' You're so damn literal bryan ', which was soon followed by a statement to Tiffane', ' how could you have dated him ?'. However, when Sir Bryan calmly tried to shut the crazy bitch up before she unleashed demons upon the land, he was called 'rude' and a ' jerk '. These statements were used excessivly until the meeting ended roughly 10 minutes later. If the affirmative was in act during this instance, the police would have arrived promptly and arrested this bitch's ass and sent her down to get pounded by some fat dykes in the slammer. Thus, a good result is yeilded for all.    In conclusion, bitches aren't good people, so we should blow them the fuck up.   God Bless America!            Time to write like Ascaril again... - 10/9/2003      Yes, I feel inclined to over exagerate, overelaborate and adjetiveafy my entry today... who've thunk it?   Today, as Apollo, lord of the sun, rose, with the flaming ball of gas at his back, I realized that in fact the world would indeed change. And yet, my intuition dictated that in order to fully establish this change, it would have to be I that changed with it. Thus, I charged my friend Jake with the task of finding a book of wizardry for the transformation, and then to search and find for me a pack of gum, because I had not brushed my teeth that day. Truly, 2 different plans of action were necessary to establish a basis for the intricate ways of elaborating the ultra greatness of my grand design.   When making a comparison between two similar beings, the first entity being Kikku my former employer and demon of Quiznazi's, the second, my demi-manager of the rib tickler, Gail. Both of which possess feats which constitute them as MICROMANAGERS!   shit, I'm giving up, writing like Jake is like tearing off one of my nipples   No joke, working around Gail is like having a freaking nut sucking tick floating above your head, watching your every move. Here's an exaggerated scenario, simply because I cant remember that much, mostly because I block out stupid people when I can.   Scenario I: A person pulls up to the window and I start reading them their order... Gail, 'umm... umm, what's your name? Jesse, you need to read back their order.'   Me: 'thanks gail'   Gail: 'okay, Francisco, don't be sure to take their money, and after you take their money, you should put it in the register, and after that, give them back their change, but close the register after you've gotten the change out.'   at about this point the person has gotten his/her food and driven off.   Gail: 'so Charles, did you give them their food?'   Bryan: 'no, in fact I told them to just drive around for a few minutes, just to burn up some gas'   Gail: 'Christ Rochester, did you even remember to vibrate your vocal cords in syncronicis with your tongue and mouth movements thus vocally communicating this message to them?'   Bryan: 'Shit, must have slipped my mind!'   Gail: 'Don't swear Donald!'   Raul then walks by slappin his dick around and says, 'hey you stupid dumb cunt dumbass bitch fucking, how about you go eat some dicks and shoot up some crack. Hey Gail, fuck you.'   Gail: 'oh Raul, you're so funny, you should really give... *whispers* what's this kid's name?'   Raul: '... Bryan'   Gail: 'right, give Teddy some tips on humor next time you see him.'   Bryan: 'I'm right here!'   Gail: 'shut up Cletus!, us grown ups are having us ourselves a civimalized conversation!'   Yeah, I'm really waiting to find out she's behind me when I'm taking a piss instructing me to drop my drawers and piss in the toilet. What a fucking bitch!   8 nickels jayci... 8 nickels  'Enough strength can defeat anything, even death', Unknown      Athens: A.K.A. Stupid Dick Head Land... - 10/10/2003      During a conversation with my mom today, I came to the realization that democracy only works if there are smart people voting. No, this won't be a political bitching... yet. I can't remember a time in the past that I was stuck in a smart group. I swear, if I get stuck doing a group project, it's with a bunch of dumb fucks who can't tell the difference between their balls... and some other unrelated thing. Let me give you a good example. For some irrelavent reason, at religious ed (which I hate to begin at to begin with) I was put in a group that's supposed to make the tallest free standing tower out of 4 cups and about a hundred straws. I immediatly figure it would be best to have an eiffle tower design, or at least something with stable support. but no, the overwhelmingly stupid majority votes on the moronic idea to simply tape the straws together, end to end. Now, i'm not a genius, but I initally assumed that their tower of cock eaters would fall over after about 3 straws. After expressing my concerns, they immediatly called ME a dumbass and began constructing their tower of idiocy.    Obviously I distance myself from the horde of inbred morons to try and scrap together what support for the tower that I can. I hate idiots, but i hate losing even more. After about ten minutes of the ass savages' passing around dip and connecting straws together with the remaninder of their eight brain cells, they approach me and say, ' what's that, a rocket ship? '. I reply, ' well, obviously not, as you can see there is no rocketry associated with this construction, and I doubt if there was, straws would be suitable for flight .' After contemplating what I just said for a few seconds, they then steal the remainder of my straws and declare, ' stop speaking your chinese and help us with this !' They then melt down my creation and form a plastic calf (reference to the israelites after their exodus from egypt)    Eventually the simians evolve and decide that they can get the tower taller by attatching more straws while standing on a chair. So, if you can picture this, an eight foot tall tower of straws, connected end to end only standing because someone is holding it at the top. Then, a lightbulb flickers in one of their heads and they determine that adding more duct tape to the straws will only bolster it's strength and keep it from falling. All the while, my head is tucked in my hands as I'm crying in sorrow for the human race. Bear in mind, I am the stupid one.    Well, as the judge people come to determine who's is the tallest, the ape on the chair lets go of the structure's top, fairly confident in his exploits. It was like watching 9/11 all over again. Not only did the structure fall, but the straws all broke off and left a heap of rubble in its wake. Damn Bin Laden. Sons of bitches.    I will close with a reference to the Simpsons. Homer and several other's have dug a hole in hopes of finding treasure. After about 6 hours of digging, they are verticle hole about 20 feet down in the earth. Chief Wiggum asks, 'well, how are we going to get out of this hole?' Homer exclaims rather proud of himself, 'We'll DIG OUR WAY OUT!'. The group then continues to dig down.             Might as well put some poop in those pants... - 10/11/2003        I just went over my first three diary entries, almost 2 full years ago. I came to the realization that despite some drastic changes in my way of verbally expressing myself, 'yo yo bitch, come get some of this suga'!' Very little has changed in my life. I guess that's good. But for the whole 'to screw or not to screw thing'. Seriously, I'm at the same damn crossroads that I was on december 2001!. Tiffane' was a church girl and all bitchey and shit. See that didnt work, and I'm just terrible at hitting on people. So that doesnt work. i'm going to become a damn priest!    OH WAIT!!! I guess I did ask Kaitlyn to homecoming. Disregarding the fact that I got turned down for some other guy, failed to remember his name, I still worked up the juevos to ask her to her face!. So off on yet another tangent. Looks like captain ME isnt going to homecoming again this year. Two years in a row, turned down for either a group of freshman, or some other guy. How disconcerting!    If you're wondering about the seemingly irrelavent title, it has to do w/ shitting your pants. Just a little FYI.    In conclusion, apparently now everyone I have ever met EVER has found this diary, i must either be special, really loud, or just a badass. Probably a combination of NONE OF THOSE!        BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH... - 10/14/2003        I determined somethingas i got out my car after youth group which Jayci begged me to go to. Sorry, I thought you'd bring up a roman tacking again, that just might not go over well with the rest of the parish. I like to think of myself as a sooth sayer. honostly, I can see myself 7 years from now on a damn cloud laughing about how I was right about my death in ten years prediction. I could have died the most painful death ever and I'd just be like, 'YOU LOSE NATHAN, SHANNON, BEN AND WHOEVER ELSE DEFIED MY WISDOM!!'. Who seriously could not see me doing that, I for damn sure could. I guess its just a part of me, to always have to be right, and if i'm not right, I love technicalities. three brief points followed by some big schpeal... not that those aren't commonplace or anything.    Way to fuck up the getting a magical world chaging book and my pack of gum you two. what kind of friends are you? shitty ones. that's the kind.    I would most likely laugh seeing austen set ablaze.    i should disrobe around 'Left' more often. tee hee.    Well, nathril's bitchin about how his friends are getting shit faced again. pardon me for being an asshole, but I dont think Paul (try and guess who that is and how i came to that name) is that great of a friend if you ask me. He tells nathril he's stupid for debating non-critical things. what is there to debate about if not for utter shit? Pssh, what's critical in this world anyway, who determines what is and isnt essential? And secondly, Nathril and I played tactics in Wendell's class the other day, he just sat back and laughed at us. Bastard Paul is acloset gamer. which is whati hate, ignoring someone who you get along with only to climb the social ladder. Ironically enough, i'm tying contentment into this. I'm content with the friends I have. Whether it be a guy with a black lady dance questioning his sexuality, or a busty brunette who can't help being perpetually blasphemous. And even the person who defines capriciousness. i love my friends adn i'm happy to have them.    Whoever can not only guess who Left is but how I came th that name gets 2 dollars.         God   bless   America !         Xylothin the crooked sword... - 10/21/2003        I have determined that I am the odd man out. It is always nate and jake, ben and bret, cris and taylor, jayci and everyone else. Bryan and who then? I suppose this has been true since my earliest years. I was always with the reject or five leged person when we wetn on field trips. I truly don't understand what's going to happen when I get older. Greg has Roger, they helped each other move into their new apartments. Who the hell do I have? I always said I valued a close friendship over a hundred mediocre ones, but how many close friendships do I actually have, that has been troubling me for the last few days.    Today I discovered that my affection for Kaitlyn is simply a crush. nothing more. I used to think she'd change, stop drinking, stop all of that. I also thought her past was a relativly clean slate. Neither seem to be true. She told me she'd stop drinking, she didn't. Plus, I just can't seem to talk to her. I may get in a few minutes of conversation, and then it dies. We are just two different people, i'm a crazy ass gamer with no respect for alchoholism, and she's a partying person who... doesn't game? Moral of the story is, Bryan's gonna have to try harder to find someone.    A dark shadow has seemed to come over Nate as of recent. I'm sorry, but he's just being an asshole. Something is different, obviously, i'm not aware of all the circumstances, but something drastic has changed about him. It's not even like he's more evil today (PA reference), there's just something different in his eyes. In a related story, he complained that I call him fickle because of his constant changing. And followed up about the vile nature of stagnation. I realize now that fickle is not the word to describe his predicament.    Discontentment.    I am content, therefore I see little reason to constantly change, to need to see new faces, to fall in love with new video games. Nate on the other hand just isn't content in my opinion. That is why his mind changes frequently. It's like ADD i suppose. He just won't commit to something unless it's a 100%, God's blessing sure thing. Which is why I doubt 6 nuts will actually ever come into existance. I reasonthe word discontentment because he told me he'd flaunt his wealth God willing he obtains it. I can honostly say, if I can support myself, a family and my gaming addiction, I am content. If I dont have to count every penny to keep out of debtors prison, I'd be fine with that.    Jake can make me laugh like no one else can, understands my animeism and gameism, but we just dont communicate about other things enough, in all honosty, I'd really like to. But then again, it's jake and nathan.    Bret goes to netzone with me, he's the only one other than johnny who has. but then again, it's bret and ben    Ben, like jake, can make me laugh hystarically, but itreally kills me that he's at a level in speaking that I could only dream of. but then again, it's ben and bret    Jayci, she's damn funny, i really enjoy talking to her, but then again, its jayci and TOMBALL!    Nathan argues with me, and is always wrong, but he tries to put up a fight, but then again, it's nathan, jake, audy and the populars.     Greg, my brother is a badass. I miss him a whole lot.         My goals, circa whatever time it is... - 10/21/2003        Within about ten years I hope tohave:    ...Beautiful and caring wife.    ...2 male children, four years apart, (David Gregory Honeycutt, Jacob Timothy Honeycutt)    ...A steady job, my current objectives are head of '6 Nuts', 'Bryan's BBQ', or something that pays well for minimal work.    ...Enough gaming to defeat anything, even death...    ...A massive collection of anime and games.    ...The collection of games I have currently, NOT SELLING A DAMN THING... except for minority report    ...An able computer    ...STARCRAFT!!!    ...reached puberty... haha, i'm joking, that's setting my aims to high.    ...a house, meh, apartment would be good to. Shit, i'll settle for a non-box    ...a college education    ...someone to argue w/, need to sharpen my mind every now and again.            Call Upon Holy Might... - 10/21/2003        There are three games that I believe area direct result of God almighty, maker of heaven and earth. StarCraft, Harvestmoon (64 specifically) and Final Fantasy 7. Ignoring the need to sleep, maintain my health, go to school, work or anything else, I could easily play those games in cycles for the rest of my natural life. I will go into great orgasmic detail as of to why I love these games so much. (thus, i will be writing the descriptions about 30 minutes apart from each other.)    StarCraft:    No other RTS game that I've played (WC3, Red Alert, command and conqure, CivIII) have I felt the conflict absolute. 3 utterly different races of people, and yet they were connected by conflict. It always pains me when I see my forces destroyed in a flash by my opponent. Firstly because my military is weakened by the loss, but also because I sent men into the fray simply to die. I know they're just 0's and 1's, but the concept is just... raw emotion.    Harvest Moon 64:    HOLY SHIT, that was my first 'up 'til 5 am game'. Really the concept is stupid, playing a fucking farm boy, how boring. But no, it's so addicting its like coke or something. And getting up the next morning to your wife and possibly child with about tenthousand more gold in your bank is always satisfying. Its the closest thing to reality for me. what a great life it is to farm, get a wife, and make money, simplistic, and fun.    Final Fantasy 7:    Let me explain the circumstances udner which I first found this game, played it, and why it's hte fucking greatest. In about 5th grade I saw the TV commercial for 7, my eyes almost watered at the graphical leaps that the PlayStation had made with the cutscenes. Even with the brief, 20 second commercial, I knew this game was pouring with feeling. I distinctly recall several of the scenes. Where a spikey yellow haired man gently laid down what seemed like his companion in a lake. The scene where a sinister, grey haired fiend turns his head with cold, blue eyes. And most memorably, where that yellow haired guy was riding a bike fighting off baddies. I knew that FF7 and I were destined for each other. It may be sick describing a game like Iwould my wife, but in all honosty, that's how I felt, something higher than any human, or japan created a bond between this game and I. I bought a PSX and ff7, but unfortunatly I got in a fight w/ my mom shortly thereafter and they were hidden from me. During one of my usual quests to find my lost CD case, i came across the PSX with 7 in the system, in a location easily accessable. So every night of my Freshman year, after my parents went to bed at around midnight, I snuck into that room, brought it back to my room, and played 7 until about 3 am. I would sneak back, put it where it once was and go back to bed. Those were easily my happiest moments of high school to date.    I dont know why, but recently my pride in gaming has been bolstered several fold as of recent, perhaps because of my purchasing of a GBASP and GC. Let us all bless Jake who is now playing ff7, what a damn fine game.     Jayci, that meant a lot to me btw.      Empathy... - 10/24/2003      I suppose I have had this trait for quite some time, and yet have only told my mother. It's a more combination of peity and empathy.  I work at Rib Tickler. I make about 150 dollars in 2 weeks, which isnt that bad in the grand scheme of things. I come to work with a smile on my face, but frankly, the only thing that I pay for is gaming and gas. There is no necessity to my working, nor urgency. There is no one I'm supporting, I dont have to take care of anyone. My rent is paid for by my parents. as a result of these two things, I rarely fiddle with my bank statements or balance my checkbook. On the other hand, I see people working at places like randals or McDonalds who are my parents age, and chances are they have a family to support. They always have a smile on their face, are always working hard at what they do, because how they act at work determines whether or not their kids can get into college. I peity them.  The fact that I am so fucking lucky. The fact that my parents dont have to count pennies (though my mom does). The fact that I can go to bed with alot of possesions in my room, more and more of which I am paying for. I can drive a nice car. But the thing is, I dont even recognize this very often. Now, the theory behind adults working low salary jobs is that they didnt try hard in high school and so they are getting repremanded. But fact of the matter is, some people did try hard, but they just didnt have the brain power.  Every two months or so, I'm plauged by this crippling fear that I will grow up and be like those people at randals. Not because I dont have the capacity, shit, I think circles around 75% of the people ahead of me in the class, but I just dont have the will. I suppose the one way I remedy this fear is that no matter what I make, I shall raise my children as such: They will be raised with respect, 'yes sir, no ma'am'. They will be raised to think and reason, if David or jake turn out jocks, so be it, but they will be smart jocks. They will be raised to understand that conformity does not hail ignorance, but that it is a human trait (the moment david or jake start showing signs of gothism, or what i consider to be gothic, i will abandon them, and start anew).  Back on topic. I have this peity, the feeling is a lesser level of my heartbreak pain. It's just that crushing pain in the stomach, the one that only goes away with a good laugh. I peity not because I fear I am going to become a poorly paid father. I peity because most of the people were put in that situation by God, and still come to work every day, glad to work, glad to know that they can support their children.  I'm left having finished this entry rather contemplative. I envisioned as I began writing it that when everyone read this they'd be shocked. I'm a bastard, I swear, take the Lord's name in vain, offend people regularly, and I'm usually ignorant to others' feelings. To hide this i laugh, and get people to laugh with me. No one really understands when I'm serious, which is why people are shocked when I'm quiet, they always thing i'm upset. Sometimes, I'm just left thinking.  Blessed are those who show mercy...      Betrayer of the Light... - 10/25/2003        I am not a man of fear. I live my life without having to scream like a little girl over little things. I can ride with someone driving recklessly, watch swarms of bees hover over my head. Yet, there is a creature on this earth so vile, so corrupt, that I quiver before it. The Roach. It is in my opinion that the Roach is directly spawned from satan's ass. He was probably sitting atop his throne of mangled corpses scratching his chin thinking, 'what creature could I conjure up evil enough to stave off those blasted archeangles'. If Tyreal and the average roach fought, the roach would come out victorious. My fear of them is so obscenly stupid that I almost always run out of my room, arms flailing about in the air, swearing profanities left and right. As I make it downstairs to the can of Raid, my father insults my 'weakness'. That man is afuckingfraid of horses... what the hell?    As many of you recall, my last conflict with the scourge was fought in my room, staff and raid in hand, I fought bravely, and defeated the enemy. Now, with a half empty can of raid from the last struggle in hand, a new enemy has emereged...while this one does not fly... yet, it rivals an ancient black dragon in size. And my wounds have not yet healed from my conflict with Ach-Beck-Tech (Ben named it), the green dragon of Rib Tickler. I now have the advantage now, while i wielded but a stick to the flying scourge, I now have Xylothin at my side. Nothing can stop me. Yet, this creature is sly. Even now, it crawls about, continuing to defile the sanctity of my room. But soon, soon I shall have my vengeance... darkness cannot hide long in the light. And soon, it shall be destroyed.I am Roac Wind, Dragon's Bane, slayer of the winged scourge... this shadow of a spawn shall not last long.     God is on my side, I shall claim victory...      Bautha Tan... - 11/4/2003        Roughly drowish for 'dodge this!'    Basically I think that Works Cited is the FUCKING DEVIL! Which brings me to my main topic of discussion tonight. I enjoy writing. Wendell is trying to convince me that I'm a poor writer with the ungodly grades that she's giving me, and perpetual criticism. But quite frankly, I don't care what her opinion on 'good writing' is. I may not be a poet, nor a polotician, but I don't believe my writing is half bad, nor do I feel the need for a drastic, if any change at all. I have lots of respect for Wendell though, she's a genius who plays DnD, or did. She differs from CK b/c she's lazy as I am. Though she's obviously brilliant, I do not agree there is one way to write well. Obviously there are ways to write better and writing in ebonics is not an accepted writing style, but one outline to the next really is simply a matter of preference, not superiority.    I told myself this last summer that I need to start writing more. Writing about my little fantasy land I call Hetmal. Just writing short stories about random things. Though I've failed under both of those accounts for the most part, I realized one thing, I write all the time. Hell, I think I'm at about 108 entries right now. This may not be a formal style of writing, nor anything the average human would want to read, but I do write. I write for the sake of being funny, Angsty writes for the sake of being poetic (when he writes), Gabe/Tycho write for the sake of feeling intellectually superior to others.    Another thing I learned is that I can only write under certain circumstances. Writing usually takes a lot out of me, and unless I have something important to yap about, I usually dont. Now, this isn't really a prioriety one document, but it's something that's been on my mind for some time. I guess i write more when I listen to Braveheart's theme, what a badass movie. Writing drains me, and I'm lazy as is.      May you walk in God's footsteps...       Elamshin be done... - 11/4/2003        'Destiny be done...'    Yeah, I guess this is my word of the day drow dictionary. Damn, those crazy ass drow are awesome.    Who here can recall my entry entitled, 'A total ass raping cock captain'. Well I can, and the situation has improved little. Usually an insult will be thrown at me by him, and I sort of freeze. I can't even utter something to the effect of 'Excuse me MISS BITCH', which really isn't that hard. So I sat down and pondered this fear I have, because it's really jacked up. i'm afraid of nothing, save cockroaches... bastards. I finally came to the conclusion that it has nothign to do w/ me thinking Cock Captain is in any way better than me, because he just isnt. He just emmits this aura of arrogance that cries, I'm soo fucking cool. He actually reminds me as my father describes himself as he was when he was in high school. That, 'i'm too fucking good for you low class people, let me stick my nose in the air and laugh at you when you speak' attitude. Quite frankly, I'm yearning for the day that I tell that SOB off. But why havn't I yet?    It recently occured to me that I'm in a similar situation that Marche was at his first confrontation with Llendar, his, and my arche nemesis in FFTA. And if you don't want to hear the end of what I considered to be a pathetic storyline, skip a few lines. I'll probably summarize later down. According to overall level and armorments, Marche and Llendar were practically dead even. Yet, Marche was paralyzed, and unable to even raise a sword to him. At the end, when the two finally faced off (in a rather uneventful battle), his invincibility was taken away, and Marche could finally strike him down. That is the situation at hand.    I feel that I cannot raise my voice to Cock Captain so long as I am within D's room. He is what I consider to be, D's little pet. And though she doesn't speak particularly high of him outside of class, she seems to follow his every word during it. So until D permits me to fight back, to raise Xylothin against him, I shall be paralyzed. But when she limits his endless strength, I'll simply have to shrug off his continual slander.      What a dick...       The Embodiment of Hatred... - 11/4/2003        Spectre. According to my fantasy land of Hetmal, they are the most vile of demons. Bodies forged purely of hatred, corruption, and destruction. It seems as though work brings out the absolute worst in me. This week, I was given two opportunities to see the Matrix Revolutions, somethign I've been watiing to see since I heard of its creation. Twice, I have been thwarted bymy workplace. I try to get off for Wednesday, but heather and jacob, the only other two people on earth who can work drive through, feel the call from God to go to church twice every week. Fine and dandy, but because of work I havn't been to church in 3 weeks.  I am having trouble containing this adamant feeling of utter contempt I hold for not only Jacob and Heather right now, but also my employers . The second time, Friday, seems is another day that Jacob needs off, probably to go on some personal quest, quite frankly, I do not care what the specific reason is, however, I do know it is not life threatening, nor religiously based. He chooses to not let me off because I want both Wednesday and Friday off for personal reasons. Totally understandable. But bear in mind, not just a week ago he asked me to take time out of my debate meeting, a school related activity, so that he could go on a date. I consider that to be a rather personal reason. But did I say, 'no jacob, I need want to stay and work, or just hang out w/ my friends', I said, 'yeah man, when do you need me to drop by'. A rather noble act I might say.  Nobility is a lost art in this era . Obviously my utter hatred for Rib Tickler now is not spawned directly from this recent action. Oh no, it goes much further back. I work Drive Through. I can honostly say that it is much harder than any other position in that resturaunt. No one denies it. I'm not mad out of pride, I dont have a high school education, where could I have pride. I'm not mad because I'm lazy, I always have a smile on my face when I'm working, I try to make the customers laugh. I am mad however, because though I work harder than call ins, and line cashier put together, I still get paid the same wage. Now, that may be partially superficial. But drive through is nothing like any of the other stations. It is essentially cut off from human contact. It's on the other side of rib tickler, and if I dare leave my station, I'm liable to be attacked by Sylvia, or Gail who just now learned my name starts with a 'B'. Drive through works alone, I dont have someone I can ask to spot me while I go to the bathroom. And ironically enough, Drive through is fartherst away from the bathroom. And if Ieven consider asking someone from call ins to work my station while I use the bathroom, opposed to excreting my waste all over the floor,one of two things will happen. I'll get out of the bathroom, having realized that the person did not go to Drive Through and I now have a line [of cars], or Sylvia will yell at me for distracting another employee from their duties. I guess I should just let it go on the floor next time. No one understands the situation I'm in. My mother just ignores me when I'm complaining (usually with great vulgarity), my father doesn't even pretend to listen, and Greg, God bless him, doesn't quite understand the complexity of it. And when heather and I were friends, she would never come visit the lone wolf. I hated Quizno's because my boss was a micromanaging, penny-pinching, tightwad. I loathe Rib Tickler because I simply am not given due compensation for my actions. I get 5.50, jake and heather get 6.50...            My God... It's full of stars... - 11/6/2003       THE MATRIX WAS FUCKING HOT, GO SEE IT OR DIE!!!       Because I choose to... - 11/10/2003        REgarding the philosophy behind the matrix nd why I think it's a badass movie...    Need to downlaod NAvras to complete my thoughts        Attention all primates/or subhumans... - 11/16/2003        As I have undoubtably mentioned, EVERYONE, who enters the rib Tickler's drive thru, is in fact, a fucking moron. In an attempt to hinder my belief in God, Lucifer conjures up the most thick headed people and sends them to meet me, blade to blade. Let me give you a little conversation of exactly what happens, it becomes more exagerated as the convo wears on:    Lady:, 'yes, I was wondering how exactly you sold bannana pudding'    Me:, 'well ma'am, we sell it by the side, like the little cup thing'    Lady:, 'Yes, so how much would a tray of pudding be?'    Me:, 'um... nothing, because we dont sell it by the tray'    Lady:, 'do you have any specials on like, if I wanted to buy two trays?'    Me:, 'Ma'am, maybe you don't understand, WE DONT SELL THEM IN TRAYS!'    Lady:, 'I'm sorry, you must have cut after the 'we dont sell them in trays', what was teh price again?'    Me:, 'FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST!, IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED OF A CONCEPT, TRAYS ARE NOT OUR METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING BANNANAFUCKINGPUDDING'.    Lady:, 'Could you add a second tray to that please, I suppose my husband might want one to'    Me:, 'YOU SHOULD ALSO ORDER HIM A SLAB OF FUCKING STUPID BITCH WIFE, OH WAIT, YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE, THAT BEING YOURSELF!!!'    Lady:, 'I'll have two trays of those please.'    I swear, now I know how those people who teach special ed feel, nowait, because the mentally disabled are capable of NOT BEING STUPID ASSES! A better analogy to those drive thru people is something like, a retarded dog, whos' head was run over by a tractor, though its still alive, it has no ability to think and or reason, the only function the brain serves is to keep its battered and mangled corpse alive. These people are infact, the unfucking dead. Here's another good example, though I actually had fun w/ this lady:    Lady2:, 'Yes, I'd like the catfish basket. say, what comes with that?'    Me:, 'Let's see, fries and hush puppies, is that okay?'    Lady2:, 'Hmm, is catfish on that also?'    Me:, '... no, in fact, the catfish basket is not infact an actual basket, what we do is, charge you for money and give you fries and hush puppies. why on earth would you assume the catfish basket had catfish?'    Or how about this one. Bear in mind, there are three types of potatoes, plain: NOTHING on them, Reg: everything BUT meat, Meat: everything and meat. Plain potatoes cost significantly less:    Lady3:, 'yes, I'd likeone meat potatoe, with no meat, everything else on it. One plain potatoe with butter only. And a regular potatoe with everything on it, except for butter cheese or sour cream.'    Me:, 'So you had a regular potatoe, no meat. a regular potatoe with butter only, and a regular potatoe with only bacon bits, and chives?'    Lady 3:, 'NO! didn't you pay attention? I said, *repeats order*'    Bear in mind, all this time, fucking long lines are accumulating while these stupid fuckheads are trying to dig a hole into their asscrack. Another thing i hate about drive thru is that EVERYTIME, someone orders a shit load of fried food, and behind them is someone with like, a glass of water or something easily made. So the line backs all the fucking way out to my house, eight miles away, and in comes sylvia:    Sylvia:, 'Bryan, you've got a line out to walmart, get to work!'    Me: 'yes sylvia, let me simply wave my hand over the hordes of cars and simply wish them away.'    Sylvia:, 'why didnt you do that earlier?'    Or while I'm busting my ass trying to fumble these orders around, Sarah is over at call ins with ben and heather, all three of them are trying to see who can work the least. I'm running through the kitchen to tell Alberto to do something different with a certain order, (and unlesss I do this, i'll get bitched at), enter gail:    Gail:, 'Where are you supposed to be [random name that isnt bryan]?' *she has in absolute seriousness, said that EVERY time I've been more than a foot away from the 'drive thru box'    Me:, 'well, because I need to tell Alberto about this order, right here'    Gail:, 'why aren't you wrapping onions Dillin?'    Me:, 'BECAUSE I HAVE A LONG LINE AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE 'CALL INS' JOB!!!'    Gail:, 'well then why aren't they doing it?'    Me:, 'BECAUSE THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING!!! I DONT EVEN SEE WHY YOU PAY THAT DAMNDABLE POSITION'    Gail:, 'why aren't you at drive thru, you've got people?'    Me:, 'YOU WERE INTEROGATING ME!' *walks back to drive through*    Gail:, 'hey felix, I was talking to you!, that asshole never listens to me'        A story of Fong, and his tiny dong... - 11/22/2003       The Plan:  Jake, Bret and I were to quest off to Netzone, and let off some of my fury in the deaths of counter terrorists. (basically playing CS). After an hours worth of gaming, we'd probably go do something, like go home or something. That was our initial plan... how twisted our initial aim became. (that rhymed)     The Execution of our plan:  After a stress relieving boxing match with Danny outside rib tickler, Bret and I roundevouxed with Jake in the Khols parking lot. All three of us boarded Bret's massive truck and rode into the evening listening to asian music. (oooh yeah!). We reached our destination. Netzone. All three of us entered, I of course was far more giddy than the rest. Shit, i'm just giddy all the time. I bounced around, having seen glenn and Kyle, after touching their shoulders, I went on to barely touch another random guy's shoulder and proclaimed, 'I touched a nerd'. After touching jake's arm with my 'nerd' hand, he backed away and said, 'ew, you got nerd on me'.    Then, out of the absolute darkness emerged a foul beast, known only as 'Fong'. The poorly dressed, and yet well built asian man shouted, 'I Tend this flock, and for your actions against them, you shall be banished from NETZONE!'. My party and I clearly thought he was joking, I mean shit, we were planning on playing video games and shit. But no, the antagonist clearly had the will to expell my noble party from his demonic realm.    'If thy party hast not fled before 15 seconds have passed, thy asses shalt be kick'd', Fong continued to bellow. Yet again, I stepped up to try and defend myself, and yet, to no avail. He began counting, until finally my party felt it necessary to take leave. We exited, confused at first. How could he just kick us out? We were fixing to pay, (and I was fixing to have bret pay for me). I tried to return, but the gate to hell was blocked by Fong's hulking body, it was as though a dark curse fell over the lands (plus the netzone windows were tinted).    My party soon sat down, one block shy of Netzone to attempt to throw together some plan of attack. Soon, the two men I recognized, followed out through the gate, apparently unscathed. The table at which we sat soon burst into endless rhetoric and meaningless talk. Soon, I grew weary, and felt inclined to purchase an hour of gaming. I marched over to the gates of hell, thankfully Fong's enchantments had worn off, and he had moved away. So I entered.    Fong: 'Get the fuck outa here before I kick your ass'    The Weilder of Xylothin: 'I would like to purchase one hour of gaming'    Fong: 'no'    TWoX: 'Well then get behind hte counter and give me an hour... I have money (sort of a lie)'    Fong: 'no'    TWoX: 'Look, I am willing to pay for this institution's services, this is terrible customer service'    Fong: 'That's it'    The Light's Scorn then grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the ground, and proceeded to say    'Get out of my store!'    TWoX: 'How can I get out if you're on top of me'    This took the beast a few minutes to ponder, obviously a sayin third class. He then lifted me up and literally shoved me through the gate once more. Battered and defeated, I returned to my friends. We continued to converse about the recent battle, and how we might gain access. Several times Holy's Bane emerged from the gate, shooting at my party of 4 the middle finger. And then, after ten or so minutes, Fong, master of evil, seeming managed to conjure up a Perverted BlackGuard (cop mad at us). He approached us and stated how we (Jake, bret, glenn, Kyle and myself) are no longer allowed in Netzone. Ever. I tried to explain how the four of them, specifically glenn and kyle, had NOTHING to do with anything. But Fong's perversion bore deep into the BlackGuard's mind. It was constrewed that my party was infact on a mission to purge Netzone of its sanctity. If only they knew how much we gamed... if only.     The Aftermath:  After we heard that we were considered, 'troublemakers', it hit me. we looked like a bunch of jocks coming in to make fun of nerds. Which really makes me laugh, seeing as how I first labled the nerds of tomball. Apparently now, on Monday I need to call the actual store owner to explain the situation from my side, which I belive I shall handle rather well. (despite what jake and bret think). Oh, also after the blackguard left, some 14 year old chicks started hitting on us. Now we understand what its like to be one of those sexy convicts. Hoo ah! Oh, one touched bret's ass allegedly.     Justice shall prevail... Xylothin shall lead me to victory!      i love nathan... - 11/30/2003        my inspiration is KERSPLAT right now. i'm only logging to appease nate who's sending me navras right now. what a great man he is right now.    oh, and jake and i held hands for the first time tonight. it was magical. he was playing a tourny in kingdom hearts, got his ass powned so i told him to try the '?????' tournament. He was all bitchin about it and how he had this, 'bad feeling'. So he reluctantly picked it and from the sky descending a great holy bastion which was Sephiroth. We both saw the great One Winged Angel andwere next to speechless. We held hands, and then jake got his ass beat.    end.        To Confide within... - 12/2/2003        I've really been trouble expressing myself to others lately. I was walking out to my car after work today, and i suppose my brother (who's currently studying for fianls, or watching TV) is the only person I can really talk to about most anything without him bitching at me or making me feel dumb. I suppose that's also why I havnt logged seriously in forever and a day. WHat a great expression. Oh, Back on topic.    Every time I come back to my churc h, I realize how much I dont belong in my youth group. I am the lone wolf. Everyone at POP youth are so similar in thei polar difference to me it makes me feel, alone. Well, probably because I am alone. And though I dont say it to her face, I really wish the troll would just... well, shut the fuck up. that bitch is unrelenting. Going to youth group meetings if sun for the first ten or so minutes. then it just feels so foreign. so unwelcoming. i also realized that Ijust dont give a damn relaly about tiffane' at all. its not so much the time to we spoke, it was just the thought of being able to hold someone. Its a really nice feeling. Not saying anything, not needing to. Just leaning on someone you care about. Its not the person I miss, just the feeling I suppose. Yet again, it was a failed attempt.    I really enjoy being around my friends. they're funny, and have actually adapted to me now. they're not all, 'ew, your arm touched my arm'. Well, jake's still a little wierd about that face touching thing. homo. haha. I suppose the reason I fear graduating isnt all because I cant work, and I may end up failing in life. Woah, a little hidden fear there I suppose. But its that my friends will just drift away from me. I dont really think I'll stay in touch with more than one or two at best. and even then... damn. I'm just a big fucking bag of emotions right now aren't i?    on a less gay note, I REALLY FUCKING HATE DRIVE THRU! Every thick skulled moron comes through there saying the phrase, 'du'wut?' at least twice. To top that off, i'm being bitched at for asking off for a few weeks to do church stuff and crap for debate so I DONT FAIL! This of course is disregarding the fact that Heather and Jake have asked off for EVERY MOTHERFUCKING WEDNESDAY AND SUNDAY! Now, i'm terrible in precal, but I think the days asked off by jake and heather, individually total FIVE BILLION FUCKING MORE TIMES THAN MINE. Plus, I'm cute.      Enough gaming can defeat anything... even death       Like Pinnochio, but less wood... - 12/14/2003        I recently resolved to call tiff up and ask why it is she broke up with me. but as most of you know, i'm a pussy, and scared of girls (joobs especially, hey, i'm frightened by tanks of anger!). So finally, after a mind dulling day at the 'rib eats dick and rapes me out of a good pay check', i worked up the nerve to call her, and say, 'why is it that you choose to break up with me?'    I went into this also resolving not to argue, just to listen and nod my head. What's done is done. Plus, i'm asking just so i dont butcher a future relationship. Her reasons were: 'i'm over analytical', meh, true to a point. I suppose I should have apolgized for having matter between my ears. 'i dont'/didnt get along w/ her friends', Shit dawg, Ashlee is a 'look at then vomit' person. can't get along w/ them folk. She then explains to me how her current boyfriend is a tool. damn tools.    So in conclusion, after i got home, i ran up to the bathroom in delight. It seemed that not one, not three, but both of my testicles had descended from my innards. Now I too, am a real boy!      I wish when I lied my wood got longer...       Knockin' on heaven's door... - 12/22/2003        I'm going to pick up my brother and father from the airport in a few minutes. They should just be getting off the plane from Washington State.    As you may know, our current terrorism warning level is orange, second highest, and as bad as it was near 9/11.    If you come to find out that a bomb has gone off in Bush International Airport, within an hour or so, either my entire immediate family, or simply brother and father, are dead. If however I come to write an entry following thsi one, either of those may prove to be false. May we all walk in the footsteps of God. May we enter heaven when it calls our name.    And, in my house, is my backpack, near the wooden box i keep my school things. In the small pocket, you will find my journal. Someone must keep it and carry it on.      I shall return... hopefully...       I still draw breath... - 12/23/2003         Hoo Damn AH!     I did see these two guys get pulled over for going about 90. Sucks to be them!      I have returned...       I'm a busy man... whore... - 12/23/2003        I've got so much to do nowadays. Work really is screwing over my work schedule. Not only do I have less time to do school work, but I have more money to buy games, which I NEED to play, otherwise I'll kill myself because of work. It's a vicious cycle that excludes school entirly. It's actually rather complicated, I'd draw a graph, but I dont feel like uploading anything right now.    Working = Time, Money, STRESS LIKE A BITCH    Time = -School Work    Money = Video games    STRESS LIKE A BITCH = -school work, +gaming    Therefore, it can be concluded that:    -School work +Video games +gaming -School work = -2 School work + 2 Gaming/games    So basically i'm gaming now twice as much as i would w/o work, and i'm working more than school, so I'm basically going to school only for R n' R.    Now that I've been working, I began buying a shitload of games and systems (i'm planning on randomly buying an XBOX, now there's an oxymoron if i've seen one before). When I was a lot younger, it'd work out like this. Every Chistmas or birthday, i'd get 2 or 3 games MAX, so that's 12 months that revolve around a maximum of 6 games. Now, I think i've bought about 20 Games in the last year ALONE. I'm a gaming whore. I need to write down a list of gaming that needs to be done. Oh, and I was inspired by jake to aquire all the final fantasy games, and i've done pretty well, I just need like 4 more and then my collection will be complete! Save FF8, i shall not wield that demonic game again! Here's my list of FF and CT games. *=owned, ^=Beaten    Final Fantasy*    Final Fantasy II*    Final Fantasy III    Final Fantasy IV*    Final Fantasy V    Final Fantasy VI (remake of III for PS)    Final Fantasy VII*^.... what a heavenly game    Final Fantasy IX    Final Fantasy X*^ (And for the record, i beat X before jake AND nathan, who've had it for far longer)    FF XI (meh, i doubt i'll get it)    Final Fantasy Tactics*    Final Fantasy Tactics Advance*^    Chrono Trigger*^    Chrono Cross*    Shit, I've got a lot of gaming to be done. And that doesn't even include Wind waker, Prime, or Sunshine. Shit, I'm gonna have to quit school, work or church. And I can't quit work. In a related topic, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King was such a damn funny movie w/ Jake and Jared (possibly spelled wrong). I felt bad for everyone around us though. we were cracking jokes the WHOLE time. My favorites were:    Samwise finds the elven bread after his fall. 'I knew I didnt' eat that!'    Frodo is spun up by the bigass spider. 'The End'    Everyone enters Frodo's room. 'Peter Jackson (director), is coming out next'    Bilbo gets on the boat. 'ITS MRS. EVANS!', Jared    Gandalf on his horse (again) at the top of Minias Tirith. 'WHERE DOES THAT HORSE NOT GO???'      I shouldn't be allowed in the movies anymore...         Lower Xylothin, raise my shield... - 12/23/2003        I write this entry in retort to the many notes I recieved about how gaming is 'tha devil'. My response to all this is a big fat:     Meh...     We all have our obsessions and quirks. Joobs drinks, Nathan capriciously plays games, Kassie is a LotR fan whore, Jake writes angsty confus-poetry. Are any of these idiosyncricies any more or less bad than the others *cough* drinking *cough*, not necissarily. And most probably, I won't find my companion staving off the dark forces of Bowser, but more importantly, I won't find     my     companion, being someone who I am not. And I have already guessed that Joobs will raise her sword in defense of her drinking, or supposed lackthereof, yet again, to each their own, if you drink, my words should not hinder you, if you love LotR with an unquenchable fervor, let not the Matrix sway your ill logic. I do not advocate changing to any ofyour ideals to parallelmine, other than that we should walk our own path, vanquish fate, for we are in control of who we are.    Ha, that bullshit sounded really cool.      Stay thy hand Judicater...       Holly Jolly Bitchin'... - 12/25/2003        just to get this outa the way...    I got 3 nice shirts, two ties, a tie rack, a new suit (Hoo Ah!), The Matrix Reloaded, Gattaca, The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions movie posters w/ backboard and a necklace. I was pretty damn pleased, my family also liked the stuff I got them. That's what I was excited most about. Ha, I love being able to use my own money to get people crap. Well, not crap, stuff. I got my brother CDRs(he needed) and the Road Warrior (which he likes), and my dad, some beer (which he needs) and Star Trek III (also a necessity). My mom, a written contract for a day of complain-free work, and a cool wooden crucifix, yet another Jesus trinket as my dad says. Merry Damn Christmas!    In a related story, Nathril is arguing now, not for the sake of arguing, not to prove a point, but to be a pill. He expresses to me how I think i'm some gamer god b/c I spend the entirty of my free time gaming. I would disagree with both points. Firstly, because I have not proclaimed to be a god of anykind... yet. And to say i spend the crux of my time gaming, is truly absurd. I don't game nearly as much as I'd like to. How many of you can say they work 3-4 days a week at the stupidest and lowest paying jobs in America? How manyof you devote as much time and effort into attending bible study, youth group and other Church functions? No, you people view me as a 2 demensional gamer. Eat, sleep, game. Well, ya'll can eat my balls if that is your depiction of me. I have a fucking hobby. I also write, balance out the insane assholeocity that goes on in my church, WORK FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, and go to school. I'd have to say, for once my schedule is actually pretty busy. If i want to fucking game for hours on end this break, whoopty fucking eat my balls doo. Do I sound adgitated? Who's agitated? I'm just tired of ya'll fuckers thinking you have me figured out. Well here's a happy holidays middle finger out to you!      Merry Christmas Damnit...       Me complain about work, never... - 12/28/2003        Every night I come home from work, my mother asks, 'well Bryan, who did you work with?'.    I look at her with a blank stare, the one a man who recently lost his soul would give. 'Well, no one mom, because I'm the only goddamned person in that store who actually works'. I then throw off my work shirt, trying to shed the darkness from my hollow corpse, 'Ben and heather were getting paid at call-ins though'.    This essentially means that Call ins does NOTHING. I'm not one to bitch... regularly, but Call-ins is the most damndable position ever concieved by God or his choir of heavenly angles. It seems that Sylvia has hired ten thousand orcs to fill this single position, and every night, there is at least three people 'getting paid' at call ins. two are trained, one is training. YOU DONT NEED THREE FUCKING PEOPLE WORKING CALL INS. It doesnt make sense. But as the parable of the vineyard tells us, 'we should not tell the employer how to distrubute their wealth'. Fuck that, i'm tired of running around like my balls were chopped off (makes little sense, i'd be in a fetal position bleeding if my balls were chopped off) while the hordes of Isenguard are jerking off at callins. Nathan is gay. The only problem with gail now knowing my name, is that she now bitches at me more... by name. Meh, you win some you lose some. I'm typically a good natured person, but i'm mostly assured that drive through will be the death of me.     Moron  Guy I: 'I'll Have one meat potatoe with EVERYTHING on it... except cheese, butter or sour cream'     Thinks we should know his order out of 8 billion customers  Guy II: 'I'll have two barbeques'     Too specific  -Guy III: 'I'll have a chopped barbeque briscuit sandwhich, which includes chopped barbeque briscuit, sauce and bread'     Too amfrickinbiguous  -Guy IV: 'i'll have a barbeque sandwhich'     Yuna  -Guy V: 'Can... you... give me one... chopped...

Moderate sized balls bret -GuyXIV: 'I hope this turkey is buff, witty AND good looking.'    Big-Man-Cock Bryan-GuyXV: 'I am so cute'    Those last few were personal jokes with my happy names attatched to them.      May we all find someone special, or a cheap whore...           Poor beautiful puss... - 12/30/2003     Sheesh, provided ben somehow continually finds my diary, he always seems to be pissed off. bitch this, bitch that, woo hoo. haha, actually i do most of the bitching.    This kid is really pissing me off with the string of contradictions. he ranted non-stop about how Caleb got a raise before he did, 'that's totally unfair, i've worked a month longer at callins (whoopty fucking doo).    Then he bitched because heather basically gets to do whatever she wants at work, but though he claims to be a 'drive thru king', he really works it once to the thousands of times at call ins.    And I laugh that he thinks i screwed up at call ins. I never was at call ins, i was supposed to be, but pushed over to DT because sylvia didnt think call ins would get many orders... which comes as a big surprise to me.   He's just mad because i introduce personality to drive thru... holy damn crab... er, crap, i meant holy damn crap. May you all go in the peace of God my friends...    Plus, i'm still mofucking cute...       Simple and Clean... - 1/5/2004        I believe that love is too strong a word, and a word that is used far more than it should be. I doubt I have been in true love, and I look back to all of the times I've misused that word and cringe. It is like sex, using it more than once diminishes the greatnessof the true love. Because of this I shall refer to my current emotion as, attraction. For to say I love her in the level which I hold so high is ignorant to my future love. I love my parents and brother, so I say this same word but not with the same implications, by no means the same meaning.    Typically when I feel attracted to someone, or at least in teh past, it has been little more than a shell, and as consequence, I was incapable of expressing why it is that I had this attraction. This leads me to believe that a great majority of my previous attractions, have been false, nothing more than a hollow exterior that I was attracted to.    But for her it is different, I can easily explain why it is i am attracted to her. She makes me laugh, she's beautiful, she's endlessly smart. I often compare her to a little kitten, as I say, both can put me from a terrible mood to a great one within an instant. My little kitten.    Despite all of these qualities I can list off, there is a dire gap which seperates us. Words fail me when I try to describe it. When I look in her shining eyes and big smile, I notice she doesn't seem to be looking back. Her mind is elsewhere. While I focus one hundred percent on her, she plays with her cell phone, or talks about something totally random. Calling her is just the same, about fifty percent of the words she says are directed towards me. Despite this, I am attracted to her, I'm so damn weak.    There is still a glimmer of hope though, a lone, dwarfed signal that tells me there is more than a thousandth of a chance in hell. And for some reason, I hold tight to that as though it was my crutch. I suppose many think that I am pathetic for this. And I invite you to. Not yet has there been someone I was so attracted to that when they left I would chase after. I know now that when I find someone I do chase after, it will be love.      'Hope, humanities greatest strength, and greatest shortcoming', The Architect...       Dude! Totally! No way... - 1/6/2004        I once thought that my circle of friends always have these philosophical discussions, filled with deep thought and things of that nature. Conversely, the preps, jocks, etc were limited to conversations that revolved around getting ass, cutting yourself, pumping iron and getting ass once more. While the latter may be quite true, I know full well the former is in fact false.    I am willing to bet at least fifty percent of the conversations I start, begin with one of these phrases:    'Dude, it would be awesome if...'    'The Matrix is  HOT !!!'    'Wouldn't it be crazy if [x girl] and [y girl] started going at it right now!?!?'    'A gift from Jecht... This is your order'    'Sup Joobs...'    No joke, I fear that sometimes I have such meaningless conversations that God will someday restrict my right to verbalize my thoughts. In that event I will spontaneously combust with no outlit for my senselss jabber. No matter, I still maintain that deep thinkers for hte most part only reside within my clique. Which brings me to an excellent point.    Wendell, a damn genius. But damn stuck up. She is fully aware of her intellect and consequently, feels that those with differing opinions, especially in an abstract and therefore undefinable matter, are absolutly wrong.    To make an allusion to Little Penis, she once felt that realism is not a form of artwork because it does not allow for expression. She believed that Romantacism is the true form of art because it allows the artist to express themselves and art has no 'strict definitions'. The paradox lies in teh fact that she defines art as being undefinable. Wendell parallels this by saying, 'some people just don't see poetry, or understand it. But you're still getting a grade for analyzing it'. It is like asking me to translate japanese text. I can appreciate poetry until i bleed, but I for damn sure won't get anything out of it. Call me ignorant, call me a lazy ass, but I just don't see anything. I only understand Jake's entries partly because i know the damn kid. How the fuck am I supposed to know the meaning of shakespeare without having a translator right damn next to me???    In conclusion, I am a fan of writing, not reading... how damn wierd isTHAT?      'And miles to go before I sleep, and Miles to go before I sleep...', Robert Frost- Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening           I'm a Sorceress... er... Sorcerer, Damnit... - 1/11/2004        The title is a big inside joke between those i break bread with for lunch.    Basically, this entry will be associated with Dungeons and Dragons, so if you barely understand, it's probably nto my fault this time. Meh, it probably will be anyway. Of the two spell casting classes, you have Wizard and Sorcerer. Wizards are people who study magic books all day and cast spells word for word. BORING! If i wanted to do that I'd try in school. No, Sorcerers on the other hand basically hold their hand out and BANG! there goes a fireball of DEATH! No studies required, just sheer power. That's my ideal class, strength is not an issue (praise be to the light), and you dont need to read that much, if at all.    I can only imagine that most of you are scratching your balls/head/whatever, and wondering, 'wow, how does this tie in to real life?'. Well, i'm here to tell you how it does. I can't really pinpoint something, I'm terrible with names/dates/etc, I'm not detail oriented. But I can tell you if something is wrong, good or what not. That's why i'd make a terrible teacher, because I can't really go into detail about much of anything complicated. Other than my INSANELY LIBERAL CATHOLIC VIEWS! Gaw, I'm really just waiting for the Vatican Guard to show up at my house and slay me. I have Xylothin, i shall fight. However, this probably makes no sense, but let me give you an example of what i mean.    Ben and I are critiquing some oratory which was just given on why we should eat dog food.    Ben:, 'Well at half way through the speech, he stumbled along his/her words and replaced the word 'dog-food', with 'abortion is good'. Also, the person did not look at the audience and urinated in his/her pants at the start of his/her speech.'    The Wielder of Xylothin, 'I thought it sucked balls, totally' *follows up with the Jayci arm wave*    In a related story (hopefully by now ya'll have picked up on the fact that 'in a related story' = 'to randomly change the subject'). You know how i hate being all preachy and shit. I say 'May God bless you and stuff',but I dontlike being evangelical by any means. But today, I felt very inspiried by God to do good will during work today. So no matter how stupid the person was, no matter how severely they changed their order, I put a genuine smile on my face, and gave them their order and bid them a good day. (phew, that was a mouthful). Now I wasn't giving them bibles or anything, just spreading cheer. OOOH! and apparently some girl called in and asked my age, school and if i had a girlfriend, it was FUCKING HOSS! I think because I actually listened to God today and spread my... here it comes... love, I had a good day today.      May you all walk in the light of God...       Beautiful things... - 1/11/2004        So i was extracting a booger not but a few seconds ago, when i thought to myself, 'damn, Jake is beautiful... and so is Navras.' So I'm going to compile for you a list of beautiful things. Expect no order to this whatsoever. Which reminds me, if you dont agree with EVERYTHING on this list... you have cancer, just thought I'd let ya know. Probably testicular. Sorry.      THINGS THAT ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!    Jake, Navras, money, gaming, gaming while naked, gaming while having sex with a hot naked woman,naked women, unattractive people being shipped to an island of fire, homer simpson's soap on a rope, JOOOOOBS, more gaming, the act of playing video/computer games, Super Moleario, Jesus, the internet, MY FINAL GRADES, the fact that I still have the internet, Starcraft, Sephiroth, Sephiroth clones, Utada Hikaru (writer of 'simple and clean'), Final Fantasy VII (may we all bow our heads). The End.    Oh, I'm no princess... yet...       TÃ¡maso m&amp;#257; jyÃ³tir gamaya... - 1/13/2004         'From darkness, lead me to light...'     The only person you need respect from is yourself. Everyone else can die. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, within the last hour I've written 2 entries, and deleted both. My mind is scattered. One thing that's standing out right now is my adamant hatred for drinking, and the whores who do it. I know jake hates it, and ben hates it. For a brief period, I thought I hated it because they did, I thought they rubbed off on me. But I know now that is not true.    My sophmore year, my 'attraction', was based on two things, since then I've upped the standards. You have to be smart and attractive. Because of that, I immediatly became infatuated with the phantom. I pretty much said, 'she's the one for me'. I got my hopes up really high. But she turned out to drink, alot. She did drugs and had sex, alot. After my ideal woman came crashing down, I would see her in the halls and be disgusted. How could  you  do this? To yourself and to me. This bright girl is destroying herself. She's shattering her future. Liberals say TV and GTA3 will be the death of America, I attest it will be children like her, raised by parents like hers. 'Well, my dad's a drunk so that justifies my drinking and sexual promescuity'. Bullshit, if that were true then Jake and I would be at every party with a keg between each arm. We truly are of a dying breed.    So Jayci and Nate were discussing my lack of maturity. I applaude them. If being mature in this age is dictated by how stuck up you can be, how many beers you can drink before passing out, by silence, then I pray for eternal childhood. I really getmy kicks out of going to debate and english, where you have taylor, andrew and jaqui, all on their high horses of arrogance. I sit and wait for the day I can muster the courage to say, ' I may be a gamer, but I would prefer any lifestyle, to one such as yours.One where your only outlits for happiness include stuckupsmanship and drinking. A life wrought with darkness '    Perhaps that is not what they were refering to. But I admit, I enjoy stupid and dirty jokes as much as the next junior high kid, maybe I just dont want to rush off, maybe I like being a little snot nosed asshole. Fuck maybe, I damn sure do. Nate tells me he's just joking though. Common practice for him is to say he's joking, when he just put his foot in his mouth. The 'wrong opinions' is a prime example. But really, nathan is the only person I think who respects me. And unless he's inone of his pissy school moods, he's great to be around.    Shit, try hanging around shannon when she's studying, HO-LI-SHIT!Shannon's like that though, and I hate it.      'Regardless of warnings, the future doensn't scare me at all...', Utada Hikaru           Trying too hard... - 1/13/2004        I enjoy writing, I suppose it's my one outlit that I can rely on. I write when I'm supposed to be doing my german/precal homework. I write when I should be asleep. Too bad I'm just not a reader. My vocabulary sucks. I drop ever swear word imaginable. I wanted to be a writer. Maybe not. Wendell has really turned me off of writing. Fuck works cited. Fuck poetry. Fuck english. The reason the dictionary is so big is because the english language, or any language is an art. I could get by using about 100 different words a day, just a bunch of, 'oh yeahs', and 'come herea minute'. I really hate poetry. Or at least the need to analyze it. Wow, someone dragged a dead deer off the road, whoopty fuckin' doo. I dont see any sense in reading an abstract poem, an ambiguous poem, and saying there are some things that are absolute. It's either fucking abstract or not. That's why I hate my english class. There are wrong opinions in there.    I talked to Greg about this, we've talked alot in the last two days. He's basically told me that all english classes are like that. Damnit. Really, if I want to discuss the effects nature has on humanity and vise versa, I'd talk about it to my brother or father for hours. But I dont really see the beauty of poetry when you have to disect it until it's nothing but the remains of Akira. Hey, that was a good analogy. Akira.      'My body's not doing what I tell it to...'       As the sword peirces flesh... - 1/13/2004        I shed not one tear when I found out Amie broke up with me. Nor when the Phantom turned to eternal darkness. When Tiffane' decided to be friends, I looked her in the eye and said, 'So'. When my most recent attraction denied me, I laughed. The pain of lost love is not losing the love. The pain of lost love is seeing seeing them with someone else. In someone else's arms, holding some john doe's hand.    You could have had me. You could have had someone who would stand unflinchingly at whatever heaven sends to protect you. You could have had my free time. You could have had endless devotion, endless love. But you chose to forfeit that all. You throw that away. For what? For who do you sell me?When did I become something to be tossed aside? Lies, you sold me for lies. You sold me for the lie that john doe will be me and better. That he won't be jealous. Fuck the lies. I'm jealous because I can't stand throwing my heart on the goddamn table for you and seeing you pick at it. 'It's not enough', 'I want more'. That's what you proclaim. Well if you want more than that, you have no business even talking to me. There is nothing more I can give. Sorry, maybe next time around I'll be more forgiving. Maybe I won't mind when you run past me to hug someone else. Maybe I just thought that I mattered to you. How fucking stupid could I be? That's why I didn't chase after you. Because if you so easily forfeit my heart, then why should I even bother to raise a finger to stop you. When you were with me, I laid myself at your feet. When you left, I turned my back. But... when you returned, in the arms of john doe, I fell. Broken, crushed. I wish you wouldn't leave, but please... please just don't come back. It hurts to see you out of my arms, but it kills you to see you in someone elses.      Pam came back...       January Challenge Retreat... - 1/19/2004        Holy talito challenge retreat was awesome. About a year ago I went on this very retreat, and got next to nothing out of it. This year, I staffed challenge. This entailed me being the head time keeper, introducer and rule follower, woo hoo was that an change from my typical routine. Apart from that I had my own small group, it consisted of 4 retreatents, 1 youth leader, and 1 adult leader.    The retreat was awesome, i gained so much from it. I felt moved by God for once in my life. I prayed for strength, and God answerd my prayers. Time spent in small groups made me appreciate my parents 50 fold, they actually respect me and the decisions I make. There was a gay guy in my group. During the 3rd or so meeting we had, he openly expresed this by asking whether or not it is moral to go to the 'Gay straight alliance club'. Me being the insanely liberal Catholic that I am interjected the following:    'Seeing as how Jesus surrounded himself around the filthiest of people, the worst sinners, I do not believe God concerns himself on the morality of homosexuality, but whether or not you are doing good for these people. Gentail or Jew, Jesus loved all.'    Saying this just baffeled my homophobic youth partner. It was at this point I realized my absolut need to be at Prince of Peace youth group. I may not raise a thousand dollars, or save anyone from the burning fires of hell. My purpose is for balance. There are times when I consider the fact that I act gay and that I stick up for gay rights taht people may consider me to be gay. Let them. I know for a fact, as well as my close friends that I am as straight as they come. But I will not back down on two things: gays should be given full rights in the US, and being a liberal Catholic is my greatest asset. Was Jesus himself not a radical in his own era?    During a brief period of free time, I went and bought a rosary, my old one had been broken. I sat in the chapel and prayed a good long rosary, (basically fifty 3 hail mary's and 7 our fathers... numbers may be off). Every time I pray the rosary, I have one thing on my mind that I'm praying for specifically. This time I prayed for God to lead me to my love... my true love. When I was done, I looked up at the Icon of the crucifix and realized something. No matter how hard I pray, no matter how many hours I volunteer, God won't just instantly deliver a beautiful companion to me. That kinda pisses me off. I want to find my love now. I want to spend as much time with them as is possible. As long sa my flesh allows. Maybe not until I'm 21, or 31, or maybe I'll find the person I'm destined to be with forever on my death bed. Perhaps this person is right under my nose, and I just dont know it. That would be the worst of all. May God bless all of you.      God, grant me strength to persevere...       For My Father the King... - 1/21/2004        As spoken by Arthas Teranes of Loredoran...    Again on Challenge. It was a humbling experience to be with my small group. Every one of them had some complaint about their parents. Either they were too stern, or they treated them like shit. Maybe their grades weren't high enough, or they didn't act 'man enough'. I sat back and listened to all of this and thanked God for my parents. I usually bitch about them, in fact, I do that constantly. But I realize now just how lucky I am. My parents respect me. They may not agree with me being a gaming obsessed man whore, but they respect my decisions, and allow me to be my own man. By no means do I live up to my dad's ideal 'man', if that were true i'd be a drunken pussy chaser (for lack of a better funny term). They still love me. And I'm damn glad to have them as parents. Crap, I can swear around my mom and she doesn't mind for hte most part.    In regards to my parents, I'm really surprised I'm not a drunken man whore. My dad always tells me that I am free to drink some of his beer or wine. I may ahve a glass of wine with steak, but it's simply amazing what easy access I have to this stuff. I could walk downstairs right now, crack open a bottle of Boddington and chug it in front of my dad, he'd only be upset if I spilled any. He bought me condoms, and I dont have sex. I suppose the only reason I can possibly fathom as of to why I dont embrace these two temptations is because of my friends. Thank ya'll sonsofbitches.    I love my brother too, he's a pessimist to my optomist, but he's damn fun to be around and talk to. Plus he got me 2 hoss movies. I'm gonna be his best man. That's cool.    And jake too. Just because he's beautiful.      God bless you my friends...       Just maybe... - 1/21/2004        'Maybe Cris is right. Maybe I dont know what love is. Maybe I'm just a stupid little teenager chasing every skirt I see. But maybe not.',Roac Wind    When I look in your eyes, I see everything I want. Youare the bringer of joy, and the dealer of death. When I look in your eyes, I see beauty. You aren't hot, by no means are you a venus, but that is why the attraction is much more fervent. Perfection is not a real thing, but you're pretty damn close. Maybe your smile is crooked, or maybe you hair isn't straight. Maybe not.    When I look in your eyes, I see laughter. You make me smile. When I screw up and fall on my own sword, you smile, and that's all that matters. Maybe you're not always smiling. Maybe you're not always laughing. Maybe. But maybe I can make you smile, maybe I can make you smile. Just maybe.    When I look in your eyes, I see saddness. You are searching. Just as I am. Searching for a companion. You have lost faith, but I have come to restore it. Maybe you already have a companion. Maybe he's right for you. Maybe I'm not even close. Maybe not.    When I look in your eyes, I see a void. I know now that  he  isn't enough for you. He can't afford you. He isn't even visible in that void. He just emphasizes what's missing. Maybe I'm here to fill your void. Maybe I'm here to complete you. Just maybe. Just... maybe.      Maybe not...       Just maybe clarification... - 1/21/2004        That last entry was a tad confusing if ya ask me. It was written to my current topic of discussion, however, I believe the entry relates not to one person per se, it pertains to my concept of who my love shall be, and my mission. Meh, something like that. I doubt the person even knows who its too... Just maybe...       Nalack'Ta Del Veck'Dodan Zey-Tel...        The Eternal Veil... - 1/21/2004        I once blamed the Phantom for casting this veil over my eyes. Blinding me from seeing who she truly is. But I know now it was not her who cast this veil. It was me. The reason I 'fall in love' too easily, or so says Cris, is because of this veil I unwittingly cast over myself. I suppose what I see with this veil is this perfect woman. Perhaps not physically, but I just want to envision this attraction as right for me. Maybe it's a Matrix. Somethign I pull over my eyes to blind me from teh truth that there is no 'right girl'. Perhaps this eternal veil represents my ignorance. Or maybe it shows how I am so yearning for this love. I am yearning to chase after someone.    I want to be in love. I want the chase to be over. So I cast this veil over my head. Blinding myself from truth. So the reality that kicks in hits me hard, makes me want out. But I can't get out. The Veil, as by name is eternal... maybe. I suppose when I do chase after someone, then it will be lifted. Maybe not.    I pray for strength. Strength handed down by God to persevere. So that I might find my love at the road's end. That the journey might be over, and my life might begin. This is what I pray for. Lord God, grant me strength...      When does it end...     I've been thinking lately... - 1/25/2004        I've been thinking about you alot lately. Maybe i'm just too filled with hope to see the possibility of failure. Or just because I'm so head over heels. I'm not sure if you make me happy, or make me sad. When I think about your crooked smile, I laugh, but when I remember you're in someone else's arms, my eyes turn dark. It's a complicated situation I'm sure. And I apologize endlessly to you. I wish...    I wish you were here,    I wish your hand was in mine,    I wish I could wipe away that tear,    I wish I could make you laugh,    I wish I never make you cry,    I wish you were in my arms,    I hope... you don't leave. Right now, i'm pretty confused. I want to give up the chase, I'm lost. But maybe, if I give up the chase, I'll be lost without you. I've been thinking about you alot lately. I think that makes me happy. Just to know you're in my mind. I've been thinking, what if the journey is over? Or what if I'll never know...      I just wish...       Just say no kids... - 1/27/2004        The DARE program is a waste of taxpayers money. Having an overweight cop come into a 7th grade classroom and explain the terrible thigns that are associated with drugs and alchohol wont do shit. I proprose a new program which I am damn sure will work, or die trying, that being the kids will die in the process.    Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my grand drug/drinking/crime detterent. It is called VGADS!!! IT is an acronym for  Video Gaming Agasint Drugs and Shit . Jake and I determined that Gaming led us down the right path through our adolecence. When you game, you dont have friends, so who's going to tempt you into bad stuff like that? When you buy games, you cant go out and buy drugs, so toke up on Mario world my friends... by that I mean play it, dont roll up mario games. When you play video games, women are less likely to sex your pastey ass up. How great would that be, no more premarital sex AND no more abortion. See, gaming is truly the greatest gift of all.    And to the Dumbocrats who believe gaming constitutes a great evil in this world. How about I bust a cap in yo' ass. haha, i'm just joking. But to say that gaming should be banned b/c it leads to violence, then how about we throw out television as a greater whole, books, and the majority of music? They have equally violent tendecies in lyrics and visuals. If you're susceptable enough to play GTA 3 and then go out shooting people, you're too fucking stuipd to be allowed in society, you should be killed immideatly. It's not my fucking fault some dumbass parents allow their 3 year old kids to play GTA 3, stupidass parents should be the ones with the warning lables. Seriously, if i had my way, 90% of those asshole parents who show their kids porn or south park at the tender age of 10 should be sent to jail and have *Warning, this adult has no right to bear offspring or not have their balls beaten in* tattoed over their face. That way they'll get their balls kicked in into yesteryear.    In conclusion, fuck everybody... I like writing unserious shit.      The power is YOURS...       When you walk away... - 1/29/2004         'You don't hear me say...'     I'm contemplating my current situation at hand. I am still stuck waiting. As I've said, she does have a boyfriend. It doesn't matter that I have feelings for her and she has a boyfriend, that's happened before. What kills me is that she has feelings for me too. It's hard as hell on me. And the more I think about it, the more i talk ot the boyfriend, I realize I shouldnt be waiting, I should be moving on. Sitting down pouting won't make things move any faster. And from what i understand, he seems to truly love her, and the feeling is mutual from her. Why taint so beautiful a thing?    Another thing that concerns me. She is unhappy or so she says. I try to make her smile, I try to make her laugh. And by doing this, i take on her sadness, i assume her pain. This is unbearable.    'You don't have a girlfriend to look cool or to tell your friends, you have a girlfriend to be happy, so if you're not happy, you're missing the point', Dusk.    This is what's happening. I want to be happy with her. But I can't be with her, or happy. So unless something changes, maybe it needs to be me, or perhaps it's just out of my control, the ideal shall fall. All of this to waste. I suppose after praying a rosary about it, part of which she was present for, I realiized the truth. The truth that I simply cannot persevere. Having realized this, we seem to be drifting, even further than where we once were, or going towards. It pains me to see her, not in my arms, but once more, for God to answer one prayer, he must reject another. I will assume this pain to allow her leave. For now...      '... please, oh baby, don't go.'       Phuck Physics... - 2/4/2004        Ahh, after cracking my knuckles of bictching, i'm back in the mood for my regular style of writing. Humorous bitching. Well, before i begin I shall do one serious monolouge... i guess.    I was told I blew 'her' having feelings for me, waaaaaay out of proportion. But i ask, how would you interpret someone having feelings for you while in another relationship? She's probably right though. After all, I did throw my fragile body into harms way. I guess I was reaching for hope. Worked well ya?    Okay, enough of that shit, into my hilarity! After having put much thought into this, i've realized i'm a very hateful person. In fact, I hate most everyone. And everything. If there's something I don't have, i probably havnt heard about it yet. Let me run down the list of all the stupid sonsofbitches that dwell in my already demonic physics class.     Stupid Fat Anti-Religious-discussion Crazy Bitch :    I may be in the middle of a religious conversation with someone and bring up tsome of the key words, like Jesus, God, religion, Catholic. Every time it is followed by this bitch waddling her jelatenous body mass over in a putrid manner which involves the gnashing of teeth. In a shrill, banshee like voice, she shreaks, 'WILL YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT', as though the mention of the Christ burns away at her blubber. I then retort with something along the lines of: 'what? this does not concern you, and back off'. In her infinite wisdom she responds with a well thought up, 'this is why no one likes you'. At this point you can imagine me doing my WHAT THE FUCK hand motion thing. yeah, you know the one.     Stuipd Fat Boyfriend-obsessed crazy bitch:     I really need to describe this Crazybitch. Picture alice mcdonald, emphasis on the blatant misuse of a midriff. now add about 100 pounds, a big case of DSL and facial features which resembe a swine. There you have her. Oh, and if her grossly unattractive features were not enough, it is the fact that she talks about her 57 year old boyfriend (barely exagerated) and how they have a well developed sex life, and that they have planned their marriage and how many babies they will abort. Half the time I just want to slap her hog face and say, 'BETRAYER OF THE LIGHT!!! No man should be attracted to you because you ARE UGLY and you have no sense of direction. You buy more clothes than you wear!!! If you fucking covered up I could justify your gross expendetures on clothing!!! But no, you dress like a skank and you are a bitch!!!'. The rest of the time I'm just so repulsed by her I want to throw myself into an unquencheble fire. Woe is me.     Group of druggie car-obsessed freaks:     I can't accuratly describe this tribe of morons without the use of a conversation (warning: exagerations may follow):    Druggie I: 'So dude, iwas totally cruisin' down 249 in my sweet ass V8 with the jacked up rims and tha X10YL system... ya, you know da one. And I was jammin to some shit when I looked over and saw Rims N' Shit just opened up, and I was like dude'    Dumbass: 'totally'    Drugface: 'were you smokin' a blunt?'    Druggie I: 'Dude, totally'    Dumbass: 'totally'    Drugface: 'but dude, were you like, smokin' it?'    Dumbass: 'totally'    Druggie I: 'So dumbass, what system do you have, how much dollars did you drop on that sweet ass ride of yos? do you gots a V8, or what homes?'    Dumbass: 'totally'    Drugface: 'dude, i'm serious, were you like smoking like a blunt yo?'    Dumbass: 'heh, totally'    Shit, that took a lot outa me. By the way, I'm a level 7 Sorcerer and Jake is a lv 7 bard, so watch yoselves! Oh, and Jones is pissed at me because I'm not helping her w/ the CX shit for debate. I am endlessly pissed about this whole thing. For one thing, I was out doing my junior conference during the entire lesson (which bret and gus did), I have NO idea what teh case structure is like, my teacher doesnt even konw.Also, she told me to look for statistics on teh ocean... WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN??? the people teaching me are not experts on CX. The whole concept of doing CX is a waste of my fucking time. Funny thing is, when D let us slack off in debate, i worked hard, now that she's raining down the hells in my class, i dont fucking care.    Oh yes, how could i conclude without touching on 'The Final Battle'. It was a starcraft match between Glenn and I, and as some may have interpreted from the title, it was 'the final battle' between glenn and i. It lasted 4 and a half hours. It was the most epic conflict to take place. At the conclusion (which was Glenn's concession of defeat), the battlefield was nothing more than a smoking wasteland. Covered in layers of ash upon blood and rotting corpses. The sky would not show for all the smoke that rose. Though I claimed victory, it was a hollow one. I still want his blood. The bastard shall pay.      Totally...           Just another day... - 2/7/2004        This will be a retelling of the events that took place the seventh of february, 2004. This won't be a funny entry, nor a sad one, just one about what I did taht day. As I said, just another day.    So I woke up around nine thirty in hte morning to start my prayer talk. It's basically a 20 minute speech I have to give on the upcoming challenge retreat regarding my prayer life and how it's developed. Truthfully it wont be that hard, because unlike the rest of the youth group, i devoted most of last year to writing and giving speeches, so I know the basic format and presentation. So I opened up Word Perfect and began typing. It turned out well, i wrote most of the outline during my few break times at work last thursday, so all i really did was elaborate.    I had recently taken off Carly's sn from my buddy list, just trying to put her out of mind, just trying to forget her. What woudl I talk to her about anyway? How she doesn't like me, and how she thinks i'm an asshole. Same old same old. Seriously, I asked her why she wanted to be friends with me and she said something to the effect of, 'you aren't always an asshole'... how kind aye? So as I'm typing my Prayer Talk, being relativly inspired by the Lord, I get an IM from her. So she asks me:    'what was with your last entry (Phuck Physics)'    So I bluntly tell her it was with a reference to physics, my hate of CX, etc. She then debates with me how holy of a person she is by saying how these same people are bipolar bitches, and yet I am an asshole for writing it online to an audience of people who dont even know who's in my physics class, much less care. So basically, she explained to me how her opinion of me dropped about eight points, bid me what i belived to be a 'goodbye' forever and then signed off (or blocked me).    Well, but for a little depressed, i really didn't care. So I continued writing my talk well into the afternoon. The night before, Greg got home. I planned on spending my evening with him. But instead he wanted me to 'do my homework while he and my parents conversed'. So i went upstairs and played video games. So as he walked in while I'm writing my talk and asked me if I wanted to go get my haircut (despretly needed), I gave him and my mother the cold shoulder. They later realized that i'd get about 20 minutes of free time with Greg outside of last night's window.    I finished half my talk, printed it out and got in my car. Bearing in mind, the night before, the only way I got home from work was an endless amount of 'hail marys'. I had no gas, I was running on air. So I barely pull into the randal's gas station and fill up. I got a complimentary 'off brand vanilla coke', which is probably still in my car. I drive on over to the Welch's to get my prayer 'workshopped'.. Basically it's an adult critiquing my talk. It was all fine and good. I needed more 'feeling words and emotion' in my talk. Meh, i'll edit it later.    I got in my car, went to subway for the first time in ages and got a 12'' turkey sub. damn good. Went home, played halo until 3:30 and then went to work. Typical day at work. Dumbasses, dippers, whores...Same ol' same ol'.    Nearing the end of the night, a lady pulls up having ordered an unsweet tea, miller light and sliced beef sandwhich. As she pulls up I jokingly say, 'i really hate handing beers out at drive thru'. I mean, who wants a drunk driver? She then explains how her parapalegic husband wanted to come inside, but he couldn't get past the ramp. I tell her I'll try to help. So I go get sylvia and ask her what to do. Sylvia kind of looks at the husband and goes, 'well we have a ramp'. The woman explains how she cant get past the door. Sylvia looks at the door. She didn't care. She just doesn't care. At this point the lady is almost in tears and tells sylvia her husband is too embarassed. The lady drives off.    I close the window. Put my back to my register and my face just falls to darkness. I wanted ot help them. I asked myself, 'what could i have done differently'. I just leaned on the counter, staring into nothingness for what seemed like hours. I felt hollow, unworthy. That really affected me that night.    I had to stay late, stocking up desserts for jake, since he was coming in for me sunday and all. Well, clocking out around 9:30 I walked outside, 3 of the spanish only mexicans were outside conversing, apparently waiting for a ride. I bid them a good night and walked out to my car. This bald guy with a shaved head approached and asked me for 'a jump'. I must have said excuse me four times, what being auto ignorant and such. He apparently wanted a jump. Well, it was dark out and this guy was a little scary. I feared he'd try to kill me or something. So i told him i'd get one of the mexicans to help out. They obviously didnt understand me, nor did they want to walk the whole ten feet to 'guard me' at my car. I knew i couldnt just leave this guy in the cold, so I said a prayer for courage and walked out tohelp him. He basically just hooked up some cables to my car, jumped it and shook my hand. He said he'd fix my car if he ever saw me stranded. I wish I had asked for his name, or told him not to wait for my car, but just any car he saw on the road. This guy was a mechanic after all. After I saw his car come back to life, I drove off, content. Ihad this warm feeling all throughout me. I had done something good for someone, no reason, no motivation. Hell, iwas scared out of my mind. But I did it. It was great.    My evening concluded with Halo until midnight. Very exciting I suppose.      Do unto others...           February Challenge Retreat... - 2/26/2004        Sorry for this being such a late entry. I just havn't had any writing ability in me as of late. Meh, lack of inspiration kills aye? This last weekend, well, truly from 2/20/04 3:30 pm, until 2/22/04 3:30 pm, I devoted all of my energies to spreading happiness and laughter.    Last challenge retreat, my mission was to command the entire staff, I was the time keeper and rule maker. it was damn fun. This time I was charged with the task of delivering a 20 minute(MAX)speech on the evolution of my prayer life. According to my mother, it lasted aproximatly 40 minutes. But I kept all of the audience attentive and laughing. What surprised me about talking for 40 minutes wasn't that I could do it, but that Matt (youth director), let me do it. He's usually real strict on talk times, and how long they can last, but he let me exceed my limit. I am so blessed to have Matt and Dave as youth directors. I can't fathom there being a group that out do them at their job.    That was it though, the pinnacle of my retreat this time was my Talk. Granted, it was a key part to the retreat, but it wasn't fulfulling just sitting back watching everything else happen around me. Because I was'nt time keeper, I sunk away into my own seclusion, I began to contemplate things. Nothing truly unusual, just my future love life, spiritual life and carrer life. Also, this retreat was filled with a bunch of jocks and drunks, whom I can't help but look down on. I understand the judge lest ye be judged, but I guess it's nto the sin I'm seeing, just the sickness they have. During the retreat, I belived that they were responsible for corrupting the weekend, that their unwillingness to be there, their hatred for hte environment affected me.    I was wrong. I went in there tired physically and emotionally. It was I who ruined the weekend for me. It was I looking upon tiffane' and pam (who attended) w/ sadness. It was I who compared this challenge to last, which put me in a negative mood. I went in there hating, and so I fear I spread this same emotion, this hatred.    Somehow, wheneverI pray that I am not paried with someone, I get paired with that person. January Challenge, i was paired with a hating, arrogant and hateful person. But I perceviered, I shone past her hatred. This challenge I prayed I would not be in the small group with Ashlee (troll). And to my initial dismay, I was. She just hates me. She says she doesn't, or at least she tries not to, but she does. Once more I asked God for endurance, and I still walk this earth. It wasn't half bad. I realize now her hatred is the product of an unhappy family. I pity her now.    Parent Letters. For some, this is the emotional peak of the weekend.Simply put, parent letters are letters from the respective retreatent or staff which are affirming and loving. 'i love you, and I'm proud of you', are the main themes present throughout letters. Well, on my challenge, I got one from my mother. January, I got one from mom again, and dad wrote 'you're a fine young man'. This challenge I got one from my mother,and 2 sentences from my father. But also, my mother handed me a rather thick envelope from my brother. Greg wrote me 4 pages double spaced of a letter to me. It was amazing. I love my brother, yet I always fall under his vast academic shadow. He told me he was proud of me. I didn't cry, unlike everyone else, but I was moved.    At February challenge's closing, it struck me that this is a moving retreat one way or another. My challenge, the one I was a retreatent at, I didn't go through any leaps and bounds spiritually. In fact, as outlined in my talk, 'my challenge only helped to stagnate my prayer life'. Challenge made me want to staff challenge. I knew I could do just as good a job as Brett Lester, though I feel I did not when I assumed his role in January.    January Challenge was amazing. The whole week before the retreat I prayed. I asked God for strength, and he granted it to me. Because I needed it more that time, I needed to be standing and singing the whole way through, and so I did. January Challenge gave me spiritual strength, which I carrry with me today.    February Challenge did not grant me any gift but this knowlege: that the way I see the world is only affected by one person. Me. Jake and I conversed after Feb Challenge and I told him, that darkness only consumes our lives if we let it. If my parents die, the only thing I can do is the way I react. The way I choose to continue on. I could on one hand kill myself in depression, or continue on... to carry my cross.      Darkness trembels before Xylothin...           And in its wake, the shattered cosmos... - 2/26/2004        The begining of my Junior year, the Nerd Clique was thriving with unquencheble fervor and gaming juice. We went forth and multiplied. I saw that the Nerds were in good harmony, I saw that it was good, and I was pleased with what I had spent my entire high school carrer up until then forging. The residents of my kingdom streched as far political as Ben, as far Gothic as Jake, as far work ethicafied as Nathan. With me at the thriving center, basking in the glory of my work.    This was my home, my friends and I broke bread together here. Our diversity made us special, but our samness made us whole. However, just outside of my solar system of Nerds, in the abyss, in the darkness, there was Cris. Cris knew no one and no one knew Cris. I was perfectly content with this. She was the vagrant, my wandering friend whom I spoke to rarely, not by choice, but by her boyfriend's twisted design.    At the time that I thought true peace had been achieved, when Ben and Bret shifted back into orbit, I crossed a great threshold without even realizing it. I directed nathan's truck towards the dark outworld. We visted cris. Despite my original hypothesis, Cris flourished in her new found friends, friends directedby my hand. Not only did she befriend nathan, but also jake, and later Sheena and Emily. I was overjoyed, my friend of the abyss had come forth into my orbit. Later even, I tied Joobs into my grand Clique, with Cris as her link.    Unforseeable consequences ensued. My grand design, my light which I had worked so hard to purify, would soon be bloched out. Out of his naturally inquisitive nature, Jake, my friend of ages sought to better undestand the anomoly which is Cris. He attempted to better understand her inner workings. In doing so, he offended the person he attempted to strengthen the friendship of. Cris went berserk, she began thrashing about in my solar system, spiraling energies flew forth weaking the bonds that held everything in place.    Amost immediatly after the thrashing of worlds, the entity Cris was bombarded by a lifeforce known only as ABC. This intruding force tore apart at Cris's earthen flesh. Making her face things she dared not to face. At this time, her orbit grew closest to that of Sheena and Emily. Sheena of course was the quickest to step up into the defensive stance. This stance quickly turned to one of offense. In order to uncover the masked ABC, she aimed at accusing everyone with a beating heart. Starting with Jake, nathan, and then me. It was not regarded as, 'jake could be responsible', but an accusation. We were told it was us who attacked cris. Yet despite the proof shown to the contrary, the Triad, Cris, sheena and emily continued the assault upon my friends and I. Their cosmic spiraling disrupted my perfect creation. I realized that soon, all I had achieved would be gone.    A spiraling wind came through and shook the Solar System into oblivion, with the Triad descending back into darkness, and my own companions left in a shattered wasteland, trying to repair what damage had been done. I once thought ABC was responsible for the destruction at hand. But I was wrong, ABC was simply the wind that carried forth the fires of hatred, distrust and lies that brewed deep in the Triad. My Utopia is now but a fleeting memory.    Looking at the ashes of my shattered worlds, I realize now that by severing the connections with the Triad, my connection with those who remain is greater. we shall rise again, no wind shall rupture my fields of Nerd again. Darkness holds no sway over my friends. Xylothin lives on.      Hold on to what you love most, the end is near...           Nothing's like before... - 2/29/2004        Listening to: anime music    On my lap: Hunter the cancerous kitty    what i'm not doing for 35 more days: masturbating    what I wish I could be doing during this season of Lent: masturbating    my one way out of depression: masturbating    Something I'm good at: masturbating    favorite color: gray masturbation    Gaw, Lent is killing me right now. Curse my Catholicism. Well, I've been thinking latly how the remants of the Old (evil) youth group are fading away this year. No longer will there be cookie nazis telling me to only take one cookie opposed to three (out of five hundred cookies). No longer will I be one of fourthousand Bry(i)ans. I will be the top dog per se. I'm ready to just get rid of those assholes who are to caught up on glorifying themselves to actually lend a helping hand, but at the same time, I'm afraid. I will be the one leading challenge next year. I'll be center stage for PoP youth group. Simply because I'm one of the few juniors now, and I dont cry or bitch about the dumbest things.... at church anyway.    I have a lot of doubt in myself. It may not seem like it, but I do. I doubted myself going up to speak in front of everybody and be the time keeper for january challenge. I'm not adequete enough. I have little confidence in front of a big crowd, granted, I can give a speech until my hair turns gray, but I can't command a crowd very well, if at all. Mostly because I've seen Bret lester or Matt Regitz do it so much better. They are just awesome at talking in front of people. I just cant dance or sing on stage, i start shaking and blubbering. Truly, it's embarassing. This all boils down to the fact that compared to my brother and father, i'm a small person. six foot one, both, 250 pounds give or take a few for each. They're just big guys. I weigh about a hundred and fifty. I'm about as intimidating as the rabbit in monty python... before it began its mass slaughter.    I never get nervous. honostly, I never choke on tests, speeches or what not. The only time i've ever been afraid/nervous was my first debate with ben. he walked into the practice room and I almost peed. Regardless, right before I gave my talk, everyone was like 'aren't you nervous'. i had to lie to them to make them feel better. It was just another speech. Longer and more feeling associated with it, but the presentation was the same.    In the topic of Catholicism, I shall be recieving the sacrament of Confirmation this upcoming month. Basically the 4th of six obatainable sacraments in the church. Layman's terms, I'm 'confirming' i'll be practicing my faith in the years to come. The next sacrament shall be Matrimony, oh so I can only hope. I shall be addressing this topic in the next entry.    This really is an entry to myself. There was no order to it and i'm sure i've offended at least one person tonight. farewell, and may you all walk in the light of God.      Regardless of warnings, the future doesn't scare me at all...         Regarding work... - 3/17/2004        this is what i hope to be the first of several updates... i haven't written in a hojillion years, so we can regard that as the calm before the storm... OF FABULOUS ENTRIES FILLED WITH LAUGHTER AND EXCITEMENT!!! *plays dramatic and suspensful music*    So its tuesday. March the ninth, 2004 years Post Christ's Death. The passion of the Christ has been out for just as long as I haven't been masturbating (its what i gave up for lent. Crazy Catholics). I'm at work, and it is surprisingly a slow day at all three stations, Line, Drive thru (me!) and call ins (not a surprise). Ben, Danny and I were conversing about alcoholism and the ethics related to it. I noted that it's Ironic to drink shortly after watching 'the passion'. I suppose it's like getting the greasiest burger on the menu, a large order of fries, anda diet Coke. That diet coke sure will keep you from gaining 2 pounds.    nearing the end of the conversation, i point out that it is difficult to say that drunks are more sinful than myself, but it is that i acknowledge my sinfullness. I stated my disdain does not lie specifically on drinking, but the fact that many people justify their drinking. Sarah, (boss's granddaughter) overheard part of what we were saying, and then had Raul and Heather feed her false information on what she didnt hear. The primary message that got across to Sarah (also fills out the schedules) was: 'Bryan said that all drunks go to hell'. So Sarah comes out and tells Danny and I that we're ignorant and don't know what we're talking about, and to get back to work.    Danny then tries to apologize for offending her. She turns around to him and says, 'My mother was a drunk, and she was always there for me'. Danny responds by saying, 'that doesnt make drinking right'. Probably not the best thing you could say to a hyper emotional chick who fills out your paycheck. But hey, that was his right. While sarah is crying in her office, Ben, Danny and I contemplate how badly our firing will be.    After balling her eyes out, Sarah returns from her demonic chamber, approaches Danny and I and says, 'Listen, my personal life does not affect my workplace'. Before my friend or I could say anything, she turned around began to walk back. Before she got near her office, she turned back around and in a fiery rage shouted, 'oh, and yo'ure a 'catholic', aren't you Bryan?'. I nodded. 'Well your 'people' commit the worst sins of all. You molest children.' I was used to making those jokes, but not taking them. I quietly called her on her absolute ignorance. 'And danny, you smoke ciggarettes. Well that's an addiction too.' Danny tried to explain how he hasnt smoked for a while. Danny repented. He's a good person, nicest guy you'll ever meet. Before she returned to her darkness, she expclaimed, 'i used to have so much respect for ya'll, but now I can't even call you my friends'. Which doesnt make any sense because Sarah really never liked me to begin with. Oh well.    It was then that the three of us started to consider handing in our 2 weeks notice. Our Mass Exodus we called it. So that saturday evening. Ben and I walked into the office and told Sylvia we were leaving. She almost exploded in terror. these are two of her most experienced people leaving simultaneously. Anyway, Sylvia and Ted tried to talk us out of it for about forty minutes, to no avail. We made up our minds. We were leaving.    On a lighter note, I'm still getting idiots through Drive Thru:    -'i'd like 2 iced teas'. Sweet or unsweet? '... uh, i mean lemonade, i wanted lemonade'    -I'd like a ten piece fried chicken dinner. 'ma'am, that doesnt even exist'    -and the ever so frequent: 'i'd like a plain potatoe, with nothing on it... except for chopped beef, cheese, butter, bacon bits, chives and sour cream'. So you want a meat potatoe with everything on it?. 'NO. what did i just say?'      I have returned...           Regarding Joobs vs. Lass... - 3/17/2004        Apparently I love Jayci more than lauren... I guess?      I totally wasn't told to do this...       Regarding the Church and my faith... - 3/17/2004        It would be soooo cool if I was just transformed into one of the Seraphim. The ninth and most powerful of the choirs of heavenly angels. 3 sets of wings. Uberheavenly. Like Jake and I have always said, 'we could get so many chicks if we had wings.' well, that just means I'd get three times as many girls right, right?    Since my recent entries, I've narrowed my religious views to two main ideas. These two theories that I have concoted through meditation and spiritual exploration serve as the crux for my spiritual life. Not like I've adopted two new radical ideals, but more that I've narrowed my radical and liberal Christian views to focus on two things.    I:  God does not hear our words, but understands our feelings.     This came to me as I was praying. I'm not too good when it comes to sayign the our father. Conversely, I'm sure many people can say the ourfather in four languages, and backwords. But do they mean it? Plus, a divine being would not reduce Himself/Herself to the archaic way which humans communicate, that being vocally. It is in my belief that God listens to what is in our hearts, not what is on our lips. Not to say that all people who pray correctly are bad, some intentions are true and some are false. This falls in line with my belief that God does not condemn those who worship him by name. To live a Christian life, you don't need to worship him by name, but worship Jesus by walking in his path, by doing good deeds. So if you say in your mind, 'Buddah, you keep me safe', but are fundamentally a good person, I weigh your spirituallity far above anyone who declares Jesus as king, but fails to follow in their 'king's' footsteps. This is why I have trouble accepting saturday parties, and sunday Christians as truly good people. Christianity it seems, has been reduced to no more than a brand name. People are Christian to be cool. Rarely is thequalityof their faith up to par.    II:  The scientific explanation of Holy events does not reduce the spiritual mystery behind it.     Evolution. The Big Bang Theory. These two things are regarded as heresy by some. But I say to you, does the fact that the sky is blue because of light refracting off the ozone layer, or that the grass is green due to photosynthesis reduce the fact that it is all willed by God? No. Nowhere in the old testament, or new will you find a verse, chapter or book regarding the concepts of algebra or calculus, but are they blaspheme? Nowhere in any version of the bible will you find God explaining that stars are created by a fusion reaction. But does that mean fusion reactions did not, nor will not occur? This belief allows me to look at the bible from a less than literal standpoint. The bible was written for an ancient people from an ancient perspective. The message, though from a different viewpoint is still the same though. Do not kill, Love your neighbor, Love God. Those things do not change.      I Corinthians Chapter 13...           Regarding love... - 3/17/2004      I have NO good inspiration to look to when it comes to finding someone. My dad tells me that I should find someone attractive. That my quest for a female who I can cross swords with in discussion is futile. That I should find someone attractive, and then train them to think. This disgusts me. I love my dad, but his mind is so inconcieveably warped on the concept of love. It is the antithesis of mine i must say. (well, I would like a hot chick,lol).    I prayed a rosary to find my love. I know that i will, but I'm so damn impatient. I want to know who I'm going to spend the rest of my life with now. I want the rest of my life to START now. I want my love to be able to kick my ass every now and then in StarCraft. I want to talk about how great Sephiroth is with my companion. But, i'll probably die single or miss the one chance I get. Damn. I'm just a flawed person. I expect so much.    It's gotten better though. Ican control my inital urge to think the cute girl that walks by me in the hall just happens to be my future wife.    I've been here waiting for you...    Right hereon this old bench...    But i've been here so long waiting...    So long that I can't leave from here...    Let's sit down together...    And watch the sun set...    Together...      Until the end of my days...           Working outside is fun in theory... - 3/19/2004        So I bought Harvest Moon: A wonderful Life, the day it came out. That being the seventeenth of March, 2004. Nineteen days before the greatest of all movies comes out on DVD.    Anyways, it's kind of ironic. The game is where you as the player, go outside all day and work. Which in real life I would hate until kingdom come, but this game genre is just so addicting. Nothing is more fun than watching your chickens grow, or your crops come to eyes height. Or trying to woo that special lady into marraige. I'll go off on a tangent about that later. I bought the game wednesday before work. Worked, came home and played a video game about manual labor. Went to bed at five playing teh damn game. Woke up to a mother telling me to pull weeds. It's fucking crazy.    As for my review on the game. It's nothing like the previous harvest moon games I've played. In some aspects, its a lot easier, but also much harder than the previous HM models. For example, there's no clearing out your field. You basically inherit this farm your dad bought just before he died. (Note: at one point in time, someone says, ' your father died and was no longer able to take care of the farm '... Natsume is notorious for bad translation, its almost Zero Wing bad sometimes.) You already have a field of grass prepared for you, and you get a horse and cow for free. Picking up chicks is worlds easier compared to teh GBA version. You basically show up to the front door of a girl's house with flowers and she throws herself at you. (it helps being the only able body in the whole damn town :P).    On the other hand, there are NO festivals, no days (monday tuesday, etc) and you cannot get married until the end of the first year. Seriously, I proposed the end of spring, and wont hit it with my special lady until next spring. wtf? Also, when watering plants, there's no water can (to my knowledge) that waters an entire patch, plus, you need a laser guided bucket to hit the damn patch of seeds some times. You pretty much aim your bucket with the joystick, and hope to God a faint breeze doesnt catch it and move it off target... its sensitive like nothign else. Fun game though, I'll play harvest moon until the day I die.    Off on my tangent. Getting married in harvest moon is simple. You wake up, pick flowers, give hot chick flowers, give girl (with visible beating heart) blue feather, and walk down aisle. I wish it was that easy in real life. But I'm afraid of going outside to pick flowers... there are bears outside.      As to the effect of juging weather...           I do this for Auir... - 4/9/2004  Its about damn time I started logging again. hell.    I've been going to church a whole bunch. Whether it be for confirmation classes (waste of time), bible study (not waste of time), or planning retreats and such, a heck awhole lot of my hours have gone in there. And quite frankly, I'm not really good friends with anyone there. At least, nowhere near as good as I am with my 'school clique'.  So why do I go?     What makes me continue on, even though my presence is not noticed bymy peers. Maybe they don't understand me, or maybe they don't like the constant Matrix references I throw out. Perhaps its the fact that I don't bring up my school achievements (mostly because it's a lackthereof). I just don't fit in. Just to put things in perspective, being in my youth group is like having your ex-girlfriend ask you who they should date. I constantly hear the juniors planning all of these crazy adventures and movie nights. Right in damn front of me. I might catch their eye for a second or two, but I am almost totally unnoticed.  Why do I go?     I am a radical. I believe in gay rights, I am a liberal Catholic. The mere mention of my ideals sends many into seizure at my church.  Why do I go?     A lot of them are bastards. If they aren't falling onto the streets, pale faced and complaining about the many burdens they assume, they are looking at their watches, in hopes that a bible study will pass by sooner.  Why do I go?     Everyone there has missed the point. They don't understand that they are there, not to hook up with chicks, nor to socialize. They aren't supposed to be stopping by merely to spread the infection of their biggotry and hatred. But they do these things. Maybe that's why I don't fit in.  Why do I go?     I realize now why I go. Why I persist on staffing these retreats, alongside what I consider to be a people out of place. I do this, so that there is at least one voice among the crowds of hatefulness, trying desperatly to give forth the message that I feel needs to be delivered. I'm not there to preach any particular gospel, nor to quote any of the Psalms. Mostly because I know few, if any at all. Love one another, do good always.  But who listens?     I go not for my own benefit, I don't mark down the 'community service hours'. I believe that by 'checking in' your service hours, you defeat the purpose of serving. I go there to do good, and for Matt. Matt, I believe is the only reason I still attend POP youth group. May God bless him and his family always.      My life for Auir...           Sup bitchez... - 4/9/2004    Did ya'll like the totally improper use of the letter 'z' in the word bitches. Anyway, onto my point of discussion today.    Shout out to...  EMILY!   The only girl who has, and probably ever will touch my dong... haha, that rhymes with Phong. Fucking Phong, that sonofabitch should eat my dong. haha, i said dong again.     Later Bitchez...      Coochy tag isn't for kids...       To Kob 2... - 4/11/2004  The title is kind of a joke. Jake reminded me of the entry I wrote when we were having another brawl. We have those alot. Not as much as nathan and I do, but still. haha. Yeah, I thought the title was funny, so if you dont laugh at it, you have cancer. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.    I'm playing FFIX right now. It's pretty fun. I like Zidane except for his tail, it reminds me of a penis, except its nothing like a penis. But who's counting.    I wrote this entry for one reason. The rest of that was garbage simply to fill your minds with.. well garbage. So I hope yo'uve had your fill. Now, onto the REAL reason I wrote this entry.    Jake, you are going to come to my house to give me the sex, Period. Haha, i said period followed by the punctuational period. Ironic?      Now it's time to play. Yes, let's have some fun...       You have got to let it all go... - 4/14/2004  Fear, doubt, disbelief. Free your mind...    As those of you who know me... well, know. I am a man of conformity, or at least under the belief that conformity is a healthy practice in some cases that provides humanity with acceptence and love with everyone (including cookies) need. So as proposed by my church friend (yeah, the one jayci wants to kill, hopefully in jest), I will allow everyone to ask three, preferably serious, questions to tap into my psyche. Thus allowing for the spread of information about my personal beliefs and stuff. After asking these questions of me, open up a segment where questions are similarly asked of you. In my opinion this will provide for a more open environement. Hmm, my BSing ability is returning to me. Time to power up...      Kaioken... raised to the fifth power...     30 weeks down... - 4/14/2004  Looking back on my early assessment of my junior year in high school, found HERE&gt;&gt;&gt;  urlLink http://www.opendiary.com/entryview.asp?authorcode=A633966&amp;amp;entry=10087&amp;amp;mode=date I feel it would be best to go back and recap on the way things are now. Not so much pros and cons, more like, why i'm habitually pissed off. And yes, as Jayci and I came to the conclusion today, I'm only 'not bitching', when i'm talking about the matrix. Even then... its iffy.    Debate 2 Period I:    The senior I once despised... is still a horrible person. haha, gaylor. the teacher I once enjoyed thoroughly... is now putting me through hell. The bitch senior who explained how she's uberexperinced in debate... is now one of my best friends who i've adopted the woot woot of. The only class I once had passion for... has died out because we got screwed out of an agreement the teacher made with us.      End result... taking debate 3 next year, God be with me.   Nazi... err, German 2 Period II:    I really can't stand that class. It's gay. And yes, that means my german class has sex with other foreign languages of hte same sex. No, I looked at a worksheet yesterday and realized, I havn't learned more than 10 words that I can recite in german. The two years were a complete waste for me. meh, I should applymyself more in school      End result... not taking a third year (of the same) foreign language. (damn french)    Precal Period III:   Smart teacher, bad teacher. Lemker is a genious. But I simply cannot learn without Rand's help. I NEED QUESTIONS ANSWERED. Saying, 'how do you get to this', completely skipping every step inbetween where i knew something, and started getting screwed up, DOESNT HELP AT ALL!!! in fact, it discourages me and makes me NOT want to do anything in class. Actually turned in my homework today,I smiled a bit.     End result... bring it on calculus, I'm immune to failing now.    US History Period IV:   Good teacher, bad person. I'm really tired of Fisher explaining how great she is, and by following in her path is similar to that of following a female version of Jesus. Maybe i just hate hearing the same thing over and over again. I learned alot though. I can say that much, but it does irritate me when her wealth of knowledge does not extend much past the pages of tindall. I must be looking for a deep thinker.    End result... Greg had a better experience with her I guess. Least his grades did.    Physics Period V:   Smart teacher, bad teacher. Once more, I believe that Klien sits on a vast cache of information. His only handicapp is the inability to deliver this information to his students. And beinga teacher, who's sole function on this earth is to relay such information, the handicapp is quite large. Also, I dont really talk to anyone, so I sleep. and that dumb idiot woman believes that by me sleeping, I am trying less than she is, despite the fact that if she actually attends more than 8 times a semester, she is talking about her decreped boyfriend. Moral of the story is I WANT OUT!!!    End result... Phuck physics.    Health Period VI:   Yeah, coach rodgers is a funny guy. Quite possibly a child molester (every girl sits on his desk... slightly upsetting). Ironically enough, he reminds me of my father. Oh, and every story he tells ends with a friend of his dying. It's sad really. But yeah, he's like a teaching version of my father.    End result... No complaints, I get to sleep when needed.    English Period VII:   Smart teacher, crazy teacher. Wendell is so damn funny. I'm totally going to come into her classes next year and be an idiot or something. Just for the sake of hating her. Haha, truthfully though, I think she's awesome. Her method for grading papers, that being the 'if when i burn it with my mystical fire, and it turns red, its an A' is a little wierd, and I still dont care for the whole, 'poetry is open for interpretation unless it conflicts with that of my own', but oh well.    End result... Angry beavers is actually a show for children.     Phew, 6 more weeks...       Affirmation... - 4/15/2004  This was something I learned in Challenge. Affirmation is when we, at the end of the retreat, go around and write down something we liked or how we were affected by each person in the small group. It's so when they go home, they have something that makes them smile. And recently, I feel I havn't met up to par with being a good friend. So here goes, I will be listing off my friends in the order of which I came to befriend them as best I can remember. Joking aside, no sarcasm, no hidden daggers. And as you can see, noting me on this entry will be impossible.    Glenn, You were my first friend in Texas. I recall the first thing my brother and I asked you, many moons ago, when I could see your house from mine, 'do you like nintendo'. You've always been a genuinely kind and frinedly person.    Johnny, Probably the first person who could have me burst into hysterics. I've always appreciated your sense of humor, though I never could fathom where you get it. It's amazing though, we've been friends for about 7 years now, and our topics of conversation aren't incredibally different. I recall in Mrs. Wilson's class, when Glenn introduced us to each other.    Bret, your Catholicism has helped me keep mine. I strive to be as well read in my faith as you are. It was you saying, 'I can see you taking part in the Catholic Church', which led me to contemplate becoming a youth minister. I can recall shaking your hand at the peak of enchanted rock, 'you're bryan honeycutt aren't you?' you said.    Sarah S, My God, you are the reason I kept going to church. Your warm smile was the only thing I needed. I can't claim to have found anyone who is as openly friendly and charismatic as you are. You made me feel a part of the church, and I truly miss you. I remember sitting on the coach, not quite a freshman yet when you asked me, 'hi, what's your name, what school do you go to, and what's your favorite shampoo?'    Brendon, Like Sarah, you were keeping me on my feet, and going to church. I can attribute all of my sexual ambiguity to you, and thank God for that. You were the first guy i hugged (i'm not gay), and just a pleasure to be around during the jr. High lockin. I can recall me taking off your hat and saying to you, 'now i'm going to be your mini-you'.    Nathan, you are a dedicated person. I truly enjoyed the many debates we woudl have from topics ranging from why FFVII is greater than FFX, to why the bombing of hiroshima was justified. Its always been fun driving you around and giving you gray hairs. I can recall sitting w/you and paul at lunch and you asking, 'you're catholic right, so you don't belive in the big bang theory'.a    Ben, I have more respect for you than anyone else. You are the best debater I have ever had the opportunity to witness, bar none. I have looked to you as a moral guide in more than one occasion, whether you know it or not. You are one of the only people who can make me burst into hysterics nowadays. I can recall the good ol' days in English where I'd turn to you and say, 'rarrraghahagra'.    Jake, Probably the only guy i've held the hand of. I truly enjoy the time (though too few in occasions), when we walk around the mall or walmart and make people despise youth. I am my most insane when I am around you, and have fun every second of it. Our conversations about teh awesomeness of Van's wings are unparalleled. I remeber the time, seventh grade locker room before we went out for practice, 'hey, cooper, you're wearing your necklace', 'oh yeah, thanks'. Though you were spitting posion at me then.    Shannon, you taught me that not all smart people are hating and evil. You are funny, smart and all that stuff. I miss teh good old days, having you wake up to me still playing some stuipd online game. Sigh, nostalgia is a great thing indeed. I can recall walking down the highschool hallways during the fish orientation and you saying to me, 'Geeze bryan, when'd you become smart' (answer is and was 'I didn't')    Matt R, Wow. That's really all I can say. You have shown me so many doors and helped me to do things I didnt' think possible. Thank you for having faith in me. I've said this before and I shall again, you are the single greatest youth minister that has ever come into being, I could only hope to live in your shadow. I can recall my first bible study, the one on chastity, 'well, what if your girlfriend breaks up with you on your birthday?', I asked, 'well, seems like you have a little personal experience with that!'    Jayci, You're so funny. The fact that you spent time stalking me was flattering. I wish I didn't wait until your senior year to get to know you, but hey, we are getting married next year right? I can recall picking up my phone after your first call (I was afraid to answer), and your message was, 'yeah, this is my office phone, so don't call back on it, ormy daddy will growl'    Jones,Yo'ure hilarious. Sorry about those carrots. And i still dont understand your relationship with pat, its like nathan and I, only less making out. And yes, I did say less. I can recall spitting carrots on you... and then doing it again. Sorry.    Samantha,Though our time spent together has been brief, I can honostly say that you are my new ethical role model. I am amazed by your presence. I can say with some certainty, you are the only youth in PoP who genuinely knows why you are there, and not just that, but that by you live by your desire. I can recall after reconciliation, standing on the other side of the big room's divider, asking you, 'have you seen the matrix?'... followed by you sending me to tears by saying no.    Emel, yes, that is the combination of Emily and Mel. I regard them as a singular being because I NEVER SEE THEM APART. Emel is so funny, she makes me smile. Plus, who doesnt want a coochy tag every day? I can recall... getting my penis tagged.    Indeed, I have been influenced and loved by so many others, but if I was to write down all of these, there would not be enough bandwidth in the entire Internet to hold them. (reference to the end of the Gospel of John)      This is my way of thanking you...           (Jayci) Questions answered... - 4/15/2004  This is a rather humorous set of questions put forth by my friend, whom I so respectfully named Joobs.      What is your stance on me seducing you next year?    I believe you'll be too busy meeting new people and having fun at college to remember me at all. However, given the unlikely scenario you put much thought into my life, and the very likely event that i'm still single... heck, anything that gets me out of being a priest. Haha.    What do you want to be when you grow up?    Is this under the unrealistic assumption that I do grow up? I intend on staying active with the church in some way. My inital fear with volunteering for youth group, is that I'll undoubtablly be a single, middle aged man with a crappy job hanging around little kids. Child molester anyone? Seriously though, my current course of action is to go to college, fall in love with some beautiful/gamer/debater chick, who provides me with 2 healthy males, David Gregory Honeycutt and Jacob Timothy Honeycutt. After college, I become a youth minister of some sort, and if not become a decan get a job where I can provide for my family, and my gaming addiction. Followed by retirement on my soon to be 1million dollar IRA plan (cant withdraw money till i'm 65 though) and live happily with my still beautiful gamer wife.       Why do you think D is being so harsh lately?   I suspect it is a combination of many things. Firstly is the fact that her star debater has chosen to fail which prevents him from achieving all he can in debate. Thus, she i being even more biased against ben's favor. And for whatever reason, she is shining that favor on Gaylor. Secondly is the fact that she has realized that for 4 years, your class has gotten away with murder, and she hasn't done a damn thing about it. What she failed to contemplate was that Ben and I had been the hardest workers in her class, and recieved NOTHING for it. Consequently, when she initiated her 3rd Reich technique this semester, Ben and I went from working and succeeding, to giving up totally, and... passing barely. So her entire plan was for nothing, because Mauro and Gaylor still do nothing, and Ben and I now do nothing. And the reason she's screwing us out of the original 'do nothing contract' is because it is indeed us and not Gaylor's team. I suspect Kassie would be kicking her feet up on the desk had ya'lls team won. I reason this by Kassies excused tardy today, whereas mine were also repremanded with signing the book, and Ben's just the same. She expects more from us, but I'm unwilling to live up to this under the present situation.      My wisdom comes at a price, and that price is free...            (Nathan) Questions answered... - 4/15/2004  Nathan actually followed the prompt... I think. Serious questions. Three in number. Nuff said.      How have your parents affected your personality?    Hmm, but for the box of condoms and open beer policy my father has provided me? Or my mom's reckless use of the words 'slutty and nuts'? I thinksubconciously my parents have always kept me on a straight path per se. I havn't done drugs or gotten wasted simply because I couldn't look them in the eyes if I did. I couldn't call them from the police station and say, I just shot somebody. Obviously many other factors went into me choosing not to do these things, but when I was younger, and still today, it all boiled down to my my parents being ashamed of me. But now I realize it's impossible to be ashamed of perfection. so there.      What one person has influenced your lifeas a moral individual?    Ben. His constant rants and raves on abortion, drinking and premarital sex last year in history is really what got me thinking. I have always had a 'moral base', but it was he and jake that really helped me define who I was as a moral entity. Jake showed me the aspect of drinking as a disgusting thing, Ben showed it to me as a harmful thing.      Which of these holds the most important to you and why: Religion, education or Americanism (previously explained)?   As explained to me, Americanism is 'the act of being american'. I will start with what I find to be the least important. I believe education is of little importance to me. There is a vast difference between being educated and being wise. I do not believe I am well educated at all. My high school carrer has been a joke at best. And admitably, I am to blame entirely for this. But I consider myself to be wise. And i weigh wisdom, or the ability to contemplate abstract concepts and do things that are out of the norm, far above the ability to memorize and spit out information which has little substance. My brother I can attest, has both great wisdom, and is highly educated.    Despite what it may seem, my life as a Catholic does not dictate who I am. My life as a moral and Christian entity dictates who I am. I chose to make Christian and moral two seperate adjectives because too often in this world is the hollow affirmation of Christ held synonomous with morality. There are other alternatives to teh Catholic Church which I would not consider to drastic. Lutheran, or Catholic-Lites, share many practices with the Catholic Church. I remain at the Catholic church because I belive religion is supposed to be where you are most comfortable. If you are afraid of going to your church, then go to a different one, they are in no short supply. My beliefs are my own, and though I am a Catholic, I do not believe all Catholic beliefs. I am just the same an American, but I do not follow all American beliefs either, because there is no 'America belief', just as there is no 'catholic belief'. In the absence of religion, I believe the general morality of this world would be slightly changed if at all.    The reason I chose Americanism is simple. Lutheranism is very similar to the Catholic Church, but there is NO second to America. No where else in this world can I be assured of similar health care, education (which is but a luxury to me now), military protection, etc. God bless America.      Too long, heck, I got bored writing it...       Meditation on marraige vs priesthood... - 4/15/2004  The thought of becoming a priest never really even registered in my mind. I mean, from the time I was four, it was understood that I would fall in love with someone, get married and raise kids. There was no, 'listen to the voice of God, who may be calling you to the preisthood'. That kind of talk was heresy to my father. And indeed, the thought of wearing black all day and not ever being in love with a physical person, was unreal. And yet, I befriended many priests on my way, not questioning their devotion to the church.    It all started on my day of Confirmation (which happens to be someone's birthday, but I can't recall for the life in me). The bishop gives his homily, and asks, 'When did Jesus give the church the sacrament of Confirmation'. Pentacaust pops into my head. But obviously i had no intention of answering. Well, Dave, my sponser and Matt's brother nudged me and said, 'pentacaust' after some girl said something like, 'the birth of Christ' which made no sense at all. So I raised my hand and said pentacaust.    After the mass, Chris who had Matt for his sponser, Matt, Dave and I all got to eat with the bishop and priests. This wasn't a result of me answering or anything, I knew about this far in advance. Just the week before, Father Clint, who I knew before he went to study at rome many years ago, gave a homily on Vocations to the priesthood and vocations in general. And during the homily (which contained a minute matrix reference) and also during the lunch, I was bombarded with the thought, 'what if I am called to be a priest', 'what if my absolute and total failure in maintaining, much less obtaining a relationship is a sign'. i wouldn't believe it though. I tried desperatly to throw these thoughts out of my mind. But the more I tried to get away from this 'vocation', the more it began to haunt me.    Maybe I am meant to be a preist. But maybe not. I personally believe I have a vocation to the married life. To raise my kids and be a good father. And Samantha even said, 'Bryan, I don't think God wants to keep you from what you desire so much'. Which I can understand, but still, I'm constantly afraid now. I don't want to be a preist at all. But all the stories about how priests did all this discernment and crap, scares the living hell out of me. My friends, i can honostly say I'm afraid. I only hope, that ten years from now, i can look back on this entry and laugh with my pregnant wife and say, 'I was worried for nothing'. But... I... just think. I don't want to look back ten years from now and say, 'wow, my fears were confirmed, as I dawn my priestly robes'. God... please send me someone. Life is a long road, I don't want to brave it alone.      Please, oh baby, don't go...       Ahh, a good prodding at DBZ... - 4/15/2004  I just randomly found this quote on some british forum. I couldn't stop laughing.    'On the next episode of Dragonball Q, Supersaiyan 8 Gogetahan and Cellza 22 join forces to fight Maajin Jesus!'    and for some other anti DBZ quotes    'HAHAHA Kakarot, now I am a SUPERSAYIN!!!', 'yeah so am I', 'so am I', 'so am I', 'yeah, me too'    'Oh no, you're blowing up the city. we need to go to some place that's completely desolate and really huge like a bajillion miles wide and would never exist in real life but hey its right over there'    'AH-HAHAHAHAHA, I will destroy you all with my super powerful hands and my............... super powerful attacks!'    'Hehehehe, I can't do anything cause i'm just some lousey human... eh he heh... who's bald'    'yeah, nothing bad's gonna happen today' 'he heh, yeah cause i'm cool'      hey guys, let's have a barbeque...       Just here for future reference... - 4/16/2004  I just wrote 7 or so entries a good twenty four hours ago. now, as I look at the computer screen, my mind goes blank. I can't gather my thoughts together. Each key is heavier and heavier. Typing has become a chore now. But that's how it usually is, it takes a good something to inspire me. Usually its anger. I hated something like work, and came here to vent about it. I liked to think my frustrations were at least somewhat humorous. I realize my life is in shambles and I'm never to find my 'companion'. That's when I write best. But now, when so many things are on my mind, I can't focus. My arms are tired. I need to lay down.      May God grant me strength...       (Clawman) Questions answered... - 4/17/2004  Ben asked me three questions... so I'm going to answer them. yeah, I'm cool like that.      When do you get in a serious mood and what does it take to put you there?   I dont like being serious. The most serious I do get is when speaking publically. Even then, I try to lighten the mood by being somewhat sarcastic or joking. It is because (as explained to me by Matt), that I am afraid of being vulnerable, and my sarcasm is a defense mechanism. The best example of this, is that whenever given a compliment, I try to tear myself down. But returning to the question at hand. Whenever I am 'performing' for a group of people, be it during a debate, speech (like my hossum talk), or just during a group discussion for bible study, I maintain a semi-serious tone and am capable of expressing my truest thoughts. end result... I am sooo cute (hah, i forget where/ when i started saying that)      If you could have got to know one person earlier in your life than you did, who would it be?   No one. I am a firm believer that my life would be much different and possibly worse if I was to change some seemingly insignificant thing like that. I would not risk the current friendships and relationships I have now, they are far to dear in my heart to me. I do not believe getting to know someone is a matter of when, but a matter of getting to know them. I am honored and blessed to have such great friends, and thank God for having such great role models to look up to. Desepite what many of you (my friends) may think, you have all made a drastic impact on my life, and I cannot truly express the depth of my gratitude.      Where do you want to live when you move out of your parent's house and why do you want to live there?   Well, directly after moving out, my locality is of little importance. I believe I can be happy wherever I am so long as I am in good company. However, looking forward many years, to my retirement, I would say I would most love to live in my family's hometown of Walla Walla, Washington (pronounced WARSHington by the natives there, family included). It's a very peaceful town, with a very stagnant population and great environment (ignoring the many immagrants who are associated with gangs and other illegal activity). Plus, there's this place called Iceberg, where they make the absolute most divine milkshakes EVER. I'm talking, Peanut butter/chocolate. It'd be like watching every Matrix fight scene simlutaneously while also witnessing Sephiroth of Final Fantasy VII.      Ben, take my advice or DIE...           (Samantha) Questions answered... - 4/18/2004  These are the answers to the questions posed by my good church friend, and yes, i regard all friends who attend my church as church friends      What do you want to major in and where?   Well. I still want to major in business or business law. I feel that having a degree in that general field will make jobbing relativly easy. And I'd also like to minor in theology, simply because I aspire to be a youth minister like matt. As for the where, I really dont know. Personally I would like to go to Baylor, simply because I've got bear (baylor's mascot) blood running through my veins now, what with greg and his wife to be. My second choices would either be university of Dallas which is allegedly a Catholic school, or the University of Saint Thomas in Houston. Saint Thomas looks nice b/c it would be very close to where Greg will be living, and not too far from home. Dallas, well, basically my parents dont want to pay for baylor. Their justification (which is not without validity) is that my work ethic is not great enough to drop 15,000 dollars a semester. Oh well.      Do you want to ask Miss Jackie Ann out? Why or why not?   I think so. After all, I have been looking for a smart girl, and for someone to be interested in me shows great signs of intellegence. Haha, that's my fear of vulnerability kicking in once more. But let me tackle this question as seriously as I can. Most likely, this information is new to most all of my secular friends (non church friends). Obviously I would like to ask her out though. But not at the present moment. I would greatly prefer to simply get to know her and understand what makes her tick and become her friend before i become her boyfriend. Granted, this will be difficult being the impation person that I am, but I just believe this is the best path to take. I can only hope that her patience can stand as much as mine can. However, I would greatly like to pursue the possibility of a relationship with Miss Jackie Ann. Heck, if we do go out i might have to call her 'goddess of cute', now wouldn't that be a riot?      What is the most important part of our Catholic faith? To you that is.   Hmm, my Catholic faith. I have a multitude of complaints with Catholicism that I shall not address at this time. And despite what I like to believe, I'm very ignorant to Catholic doctrine and Biblical theology. I think the paramount aspect of my Catholic faith is my continuous search. The fact that the Church openly acknowledges the many mysteries of our faith. My personal search is mostly through meditation and prayer. The Eucharist is an example of this. I am fully aware, mentally, that the Eucharist is the spiritual embodiment of Christ. I understand on the concious level that though it does not become actual flesh, and real blood, it contains the essence of Christ as it did at the last supper. But on the spiritual and unconcious level, I cannot grasp it. Many people come to ecstasy in adoration of the Holy communion, but it does nothing for me. I do it out of routine. Not to say I dont believe, just that it doesn't spiritually affect me.      I hope I'm right about Jackie, say a prayer for me please...           (Unknown) Questions Answered... - 4/19/2004  Some unsigned person left me a series of... unique questions, which I suppose I have to answer anyway. Plus they're funny and involve homosexuality. Haha, I'm actually quite straight.      1.If you were shipwrecked on an uninhabited island which two friends would you want to be there with you and why?    No one. Christ, if I brought ANY of my school friends to a deserted Island, I'd die so much faster. Just to nae a few and the reasons associated with them.   Nathan- He'd be too busy arguing w/ me why he is the leader and why I suck that we'd never forage for food or try set a search light fire. Plus he hasn't got any specs.    Jake- He'd probably 'sneak' his way into a bear den, and consequently get mauled to death, followed by an angry bear who wants real meat... yeah that's right, me.   Bret- He'd get bored and leave. Haha, he never did beat final fantasy VII... God bless it.   Ben-His time would be spent with shannon on the phone explaining to her why she's dumbfor letting himgo on a trip with me.    Gus- Would flailhis arms around until he passed out on the sandy beach andget sweptaway.    Calvin- Christ, I can't even summarize what a hindrance he'd be.     2. If you had to choose one of the five senses to lose which one would you choose and why?    The only sense you don't need to game. Smell. In fact, gamin would be much easier without the sense of smell, because you could go for extended periods of time w/o showering and not smell yourself. Furthermore, I need the sense of seeing so I can drive and look at attractive ladies (only one now i guess, haha). I need to be able to feel because I'd be the one who accidently puts his hand on the stove and doesn't realize it until I could smell the burning flesh. I need the sense of hearing b/c how would I hear Sephiroth's Choir w/o it (Coos over sephiroth). And I need teh sense of taste, so I can taste the sweetness of victory in every single argument that nathan and I have (but that's just my opinion). haha, i'm such a bastard.      3. If you were gay, out of all your guy friends, who would you choose to be your significant other and why?    Now, my initial belief was Jake, because he is after all, buff, witty AND good looking. But in retrospect, I will without a doubt say nathan. Because I will be a good housewife, and he will be a rich millionaire lawyer who takes care of me. But hey, jake and I DID hold hands once. It was okay, i didnt sense that much chemistry... or DID I???      I am indeed attracted to the oposite sex...           (Jackie) Questions answered... - 4/21/2004  Just so everyone knows. I met Jackie at battle of the bands by chance. She's a freshman at Cy Fair, currently the most beautiful woman in my life right now, and my girlfriend, female friend, I realy dont knwo right now. But oh well, I've ascended to a level of cuteness that the concerns of mortals is only something I regard for humor.      What are your feelings on what happened and do you hate me for it?   To explain what just happened. I asked Jackie out last night (4/20/2004), and she said yes. Today, she conversed w/ her friends and came to the conclusion (which I was pushing for in the begining mind you), to cool down and get to know each other better. I havn't even known her for a week yet, haha. But on to the question. As I told you on the phone, I've overjoyed you decided this. It shows me that you care about the 'us' and possiblity of a future 'us' to postpone this to better understand each other. By no means do I bear any harsh feelings.      What can I do to keep YOU smiling?   Share in my affection for you. Don't lie, don't think I won't understand or believe you. Keep your promise to me. Help me live a chasteful life. Tell me if something bothers you. Listen to me if something bothers me. Understand I am always willing to lend an ear to you, so long as you care to talk. Keep your promise to me. But above all else, share in my affection for you. I will do all of these things because I am affectionate towards you. Be affectionate.      If you found out you were going to die today, who and what would you spend your day with?   I think I've been asked this question before, and its quite possible I wrote an entry about it long, long ago. The answer has not changed. I would say, without a doubt, my brother. We'd go up to my room, watch the matrix fight scenes, play Street Fighter (and get my butt whooped as always) maybe a little mario kart (and whoop his but as always). Then I'd probably tell my family good bye, and walk of into the sunset, Xylothin in hand. Sigh, I hope I dont get forgotten      Keep your promise...           My thoughts while listening to Navras... - 4/22/2004    'When you walk away,     You don't hear me say,     'please, Oh baby. Don't Go'    It is for this reason and this reason alone that I've stopped, or attempted to stop telling people when I want to go out w/ someone. Because by the time I can utter a single word about how great this other person is, the relationship has crumbled to pieces.    So I took my friend to her house after school today because her ride had ditched her. And her home just happened to be connected to 290. So I figured that I might as well just drop by Jackie's and say hello. Well, using my excellent navigational skills, I successfully made it to her house. I said hi to her mom and brother, then we went out and just talked next to her pool for about an hour. During the course of the conversation she sneaks in the sentence, 'yeah, i'm not very good at relationships'. So I pry a little bit and ask just what she means by this.    She then, at length explains to me she is no longer interested in having a relationship after it has begun, essentially she likes 'being into someone', but not going out with somone. That really upset me ya know? And she then started asking me if she upset me and all this, and the truthful answer was and still is, no. She didnt' upset me because that's just the way she is. For whatever reason, she's wired like that, just as I am someone whos adamantly afraid of rejection and betrayal (not without reason in my opinion). But I am still upset. She told me she'd think about it, and how she still really likes me, as I really like her. Despite her attempts at comforting me, I know in the end, after months of waiting and contemplation, she's going to call me, or look me in the eye and say, 'I'm sorry, this just can't work. It's just the way I am'. Not to say I havn't any hope. I suspect there is some reason for me meeting her. Too many things which God and I am exclusive to went into me meeting this girl, and I believe she is special.    Seriously though, the fates have and always will conspire against me. Everytime I raise my arms in praise and thanks to God, i am struck to the ground for noticing my joys and gifts. Everytime I think I might share in a relationship with someone, I am quickly halted to the grim reality that I am indeed alone.    I've prayed so long, so hard for a relationship. For love. I have waiting my entire life, but I wish for that wait to be over. Hope has betrayed me far to many times though.     I still think you are beautiful, and you have made me smile since I met you, and you have not escaped my thoughts yet. When you read this, don't believe I have given up on you, I have only given up on hope.      Ãsato ma sÃ¡d gamaya...          My thoughts at Laser Quest... - 4/24/2004  Yeah, I just got home and I'm wasted like there's no tomorow. Heck. But yeah, i wrote this so she could it before I woke up.    Do you know that feeling, where you are surrounded by so many people, but you are so hopelessly alone? Do you know it would only take oneglimpse of her face, one breath of her hair, one touch, to make my solitude vanish.    For seven hours I wasalone at Laser Quest and for seven hours, all I could think about was Jackie miracuously coming through those doors. I'd run to her and hold her. Everyone else would disappear. Just she and I. No words would be spoken, b ut she would say all i needed to hear. I am so alone. So alone. So... alone.      I don't want to be alone anymore...     Yet another day... - 4/24/2004  I know jake hates these kinds of entries. The kind that basically retell my day and such, but to make him happier, I will reference to something only he and I would get.Since I was pretty much awake for 24 hours and running around during laser quest (when i wasn't vomiting), my body is... well: 'My body isn't doing what I tell it to'... Blourgh! Well, now for my day, that being the twenty third of april, two thousand four.    Typical day. Woke up about ten minutes late. Picked Trey up and went to school. I think I only slept in German (after actually doing a worksheet) and Physics (after doing the TAKS prep)... oh, and health too... after doing a current event on why ugly people should be against the law. Haha, it was about a face lift for your voice so you sound younger. I read the headline and explained how ugly people should be required by law to get stuff like this. It was all just a bunch of BS to get a 100 on the current event. Didnt really feel like thinking too much.    Took Trey home after a lengthy conversation about the physics of DBZ, yeah, we're nerds. I think I might have called Jackie once or twice and spoke to her for a little bit. I'm so tired right now I can barely remember anything. Fellasleep and woke up around 5:30 to finish cleaning my bathroom before I headed off to Ben's birthday extravaganza.    On my way to the ATM machine I called Jones up to tell her to have fun and prom and don't drink. And its prom right now, so she'd better not be drinking and such. What was supposed to be a 30 second conversation turned into some 10 minutes of her asking me about jackie and stuff like that. Yeah, my mom's gonna kill me b/c of the phone bill.    So I get to EB games so I can pick up ben's birthday gift (Advance Wars 2) and there's a sign saying the 'management' will be back in 5 minutes. After about 30 minutes of waiting in my car, that stupid asshole (whom all of my friends are obligated to hate with a passion) comes out, takes the sign down and sell me my game. Probably asked me for a damndable warranty. I hate him.    We all get to bennigans at about 7:30. Shannon was late b/c of volunteering crap. And because bret wanted to drive with someone. Beats me. Anyway, those in attendance included myself obviously, ben to my surprise, shannon, Corey for some reason, Johnny, bret as mentioned previously and Gus. Before being seated (which must have taken eight hours) we reminised on Humanities, bsing work and other good times.    As for dinner, all i can recall was hearing something hilarious and projecting my half chewed food clear across the table. Yeah, that was embarassing. And also the employees singing happy birthday to ben. (the song was conspired by me, I am evil).    Oh yeah, let me back up so I can rant and rave in anger a little bit. Jackie and her girlfriends were going out to Hido for Sarah-Beth's birthday. There was a thirty minute or so window between EB games and bennigans that I would have been able to drop by and say hello. So I call her but to my dismay, sarah beth answers the phone and tells me its girls night out, and given the obvious observation that I am indeed a guy, or so i like to believe, I was not invited for any part of it. Now, I dont typically complain about stuipd things, but I reasoned that five minutes of me conversing with Jackie, who lives a stars age away from me, would not defile the entire night. But I was wrong apparently. I literally drove past Hido (from EB) whimpering.    In order to prevent Ben from paying for dinner, I tried to get him to come to my car so I could give him the birthday gift. I threw shannon a twenty because I hadnt any smaller change (bearing in mind my meal was no more than ten dollars) and told ehr to give me my change back after tabulating my share of tip and ben's meal. Out of that twenty, I GOT BACK NOTHING!!! I was a little Irate, but didnt want decided to hodl back my adamant rage. We then met at Netzone for some hardcore gaming. Yeah, I said it. We played Call of Duty for about an hour then Corey went home. The rest of us left for Jamba Juice (having heard it was far superior to Smoothie King). Meh, it was okay, nothing too special.    We sat out by starbucks b/c it had closed and after chatting for a few moments, my party dissolved leaving me to make my journey to Laser Quest. The first day of my two day epic was over. Instead of finishing it right now, i'm going to eat food.      To be concluded...       My name, is Neo... - 4/26/2004  It's about 1:13 am right now. I woke up so I could write this entry, read for fisher's test as well as Wendell's. I wanted to do my precal, but the chances of that are happening are quite fat indeed. Manyways, on to the topic of conversation tonight.    Let's just consider this the introduction to my night of laser Quest. As I've said before, next year at PoP, I will be one of the leading youth by default. Since I'm the only junior who isn't habitually lost and I can be understood at regular intervals. The only other junior is someone whom I shall address as Smith, because he is indeed my opposite.    Smith is indeed a very conservative Catholic, who hails from a conservative home. I'm the most liberal Catholic in existance, and my mom is the only Catholic who bears the name Honeycutt that I can think of. Therefore he is much better recieved by the Youth and Adults there because they are all at similar wave lengths.    Smith is a 'praise n' worship' hotshot, who activly leads it before bible study. I despise praise n worship and dont understand the greatness associated with repeating the verse, 'oh I love Jesus, he's super holy and good', fifty times. Once more, this is another thing that the adults and youth come to ecstasy over, and still I don't understand PnW, but oh well.    The Smith family's roots are deep seated all throughout PoP. By the time the last of his siblings are out of PoP youth, I'll be cashing my social security checks. My family on the other hand, is small to begin with, and my brother was... not a popular youth when he attended PoP from what I understand. Consequently, the Smith name is looked upon with some reverance, so his legacy rite is far greater than my own. Plus everywhere I turn there's a smith (haha, like in the movie ya know?)    Outwardly, and alone, Smith treats others with respect and kindness, but as soon as he either encounters his 'better friends', or simply turns his back, his fangs are revealed and he pretty much hates everybody. I on the other hand attempt to make it as plain as potatoes whom I like and dislike. If I hate you, chances are I probably dont know your name, and if I do, I just won't talk to you period. Yeah, I among others have felt betrayed by Smith at times. Curse his name as those who wrought his horrible existence!    Lastly is the fact that Smith is all bouncy, cheery and charismatic. During bible study he says things to the effect of, 'yo, Jesus is like, totally my super good pal'. Or other things that have little substance behind it and are made simply to either draw a crowd, or simply remind him of his beautiful voice. I on the other hand, am a crabby and methodic individual, who sits back and answers some questions, or gives some commentary with a bit of thought behind it, not to hear the sound of my voice which I already know is lovely, but because i am a damn genius (or so I like to think). haha, yeah, that's right, if brains were biceps i'd pretty much be in the same category.    Do I dislike Smith because he's fluffly and bubbly unlike me? No, I dislike him because he quickly turns his back on you so soon as someone of greater importance walks by. He has what I gave up when I started coming to PoP youth my freshman year. A need to impress people. It is because of this I believe that Matt regards Smith with more affection. That to an extent saddens me, but I also believe Matt respects me more, because I am not hollow like Smith is. So I like to think anyway.      It ends tonight...           My days blur together... - 4/26/2004  I just finished my 'my name is neo...' entry, so I put my neo sunglasses on, yeah, you know the ones. I FEEL HOT!    Thus is the conclusion of my two day trek. Well, really all I'm going to do is relay the events that took place from the time I left Starbucks till i left laser quest. Don't expect anything too fancy, remember, I'm not jesus... yet.    So I bid Gus and Johnny farewell, and set forth to laser Quest. Though it was not far away, I can never put enough doubt in my navigational abilities. And much to my predition, I pull into the wrong entrance and have to circle around a parkling lot and back road to get near Laser Quest. Did I mention I can't navigate?    As I left Starbucks, I had called Jackie because I missed her at Hido. Stuipd Sb, haha, j/k. Apparently I had woken her up, but that only compensates for the three times she's called and woken me up. Given the fact I'm asleep most all teh time, its not too hard though.    I arrive at the entrance of LQ thirty minutes before the thing was predicted to start. There was already a congregation of more PoP people whom I didn't care for that much. Others I was able to enjoy the presence of for about ten minutes. Now, there are some people I actually enjoy conversing with, Jacob Ramereiz to name just one... yeah, he's pretty much the only one. But much to my dismay, he had brought some friends from his school (which the name of it escapes me for a moment). So not only am I stuck at a PoP function, where my only good friend is Matt, who is a fan of mingling, but the only person (except for matt), whom I can hold conversation with is w/ others. So, I was damn alone, wishing I could call Jackie and ask her to come to LQ and keep me company.    The first round, I was doing pretty crappy until halfway through the game, then it just went downhill from there. Yeah, I had been complaining about a tummy ache since I entered the doors. Well, to keep the details at a minimum, my Jamba Juice didn't sit will with me, in fact, you might say I vomited in a corner. Yeah, it wasn't too disgusting, I guess the fruitness was a benefit, but that doesn't eliminate the factor that it had been in my digestive track for about 40 good minutes. So I'm looking for a way to hide it, but I soon realized that it was my moral obligation to bring it to Matt's, and later the employee's attention. (hell, I'm sure they were glad to find that little bit out). So I start asking this one girl to go find matt, and soon as she turns around, Matt comes flying through with a volley of laser blasts which didn't help the situation too well. Matt was pretty funny playing. he was swift like... well wind, which was my name. After I got his attention...    'Yeah, matt, remember how I told you I had some Jamba Juice earlier?'    'You threw up didnt you?'    'um... well, actually... yes.'    I was so emdamnbaressed. I must have apologized fifty times over. What sucked the most wasn't the throwing up, people do that all the time. It was when matt and I were searching around for an exit and those sonsofbitches kept shooting us. I mean we're walking, Gun in holster, and they shot us. I hate people, I'd do away with them all if I could. Ya know, those Listerine Pocketpaks probably give you tounge cancer. While we're on the subject. Truthfully though, I wanted to leave after that first game. But I had paid 20 hard earned rib tickler dollars to get in, and I'll be damned before I let that bitch Sylvia get the best of me!    So while the second game (which consisted of the second group of PoP people) was going on, I was attempting to recooperateand reading the bible. Matt comes in and asks how I am and starts a mini bible study with me. Who came to inturrupt to explain just how great he is? None other than my great friend and colleague, Smith. I mean, let's just ignore the fact that I was having a serious conversation with matt, I mean, Smith's need to explain how ugly and stupid he is outweighs my own. Shortly after infecting Matt, Smith and he departed my presence, leaving me to be lonely again and wish jackie was there. Damn, that was a sad series of events.    The second game was more entertaining than the last. I measure my LQ games now by the amount of vomit produced, the second game had none. I was happy. Plus, during the second half of the game, I came accross Lindsay East, who wanted to get a really bad score and lose that game. We were very compatible, since my aim was to do very well and win that game. So I dragged her corpse around shooting her every ten seconds, and shooting others (with her gun at times), yeah, dual wield capability, I felt Hot, not neo hot, but still hot. I got third place and she got second to third, worked for me.    By the last game, i was so damn tired I could care less what happend. i think I had a gun. Then I went home, wrote the 'My thoughts at Laser Quest entry...' and fell asleep around 7:00 am. It was damn fun, excluding the vomiting, lonliness and other crappy factors that made up the evening. So basically I had fun for about an hour and a half, which was my time spent shooting people. I'm hella tired right now.      Wish I could prove I love you, but does that mean I have to walk on water...           If I could have any fabulous power... - 4/26/2004    Okay, so I'm talking to Jayci who totally DOESN'T want to kill Jackie. And I learned what my true supernatural desire is. We're talking about vomiting and hwo it sucks, and I said it would be cool if you could vomit money. But it would be covered in bile and gross. She then references to the fact that money does in fact dry. My response is something to the effect of:    'So does looooove, baby' (said in deep black voice while soul music begins playing)    So there you have it, my ultra super power would be to have my voice become a sexy black man's voice (I'm thinking like teh Koolaide dude... only blacker) when talking to women, and during the conversation, soul music begins to play out of no where. How awesome would that be? Here is a completely realistic situation if I was to obtain this superhuman feat.    Sir Bryan: 'heeeeeeey baby, I'm addicted to YOUR love' (deep sexy black man voice, while something barry white is in the background)    Hot woman: 'OOOOOH! that sexy voice makes me even more attracted to you than I already was, and that sexy music from which I don't know the origin is getting me in 'tha mood''. (begins drooling)    Sir Bryan: 'that's right, i'm in 'tha mood' too baby' (sexy black voice is still in effect)    Hot Woman: 'THA MOOD FOR SOME HARDCORE GAMING!!!'    Yeah, that's right... that's like the hottest fantasy I can possibly fathom. The only thing is, I have enough trouble beating hte hordes of women who are lusting at me now, so with the sexy black voice, I'll need armed guards just to hold the masses at bay. *sigh*, such is the burden for being the most awesome human ever made by God's hands. That's right, I said it, I am AWESOME! haha, and terribly modest.      That's gaaaaaaaaaaaay...           Ben makes more sense than Nathan... - 4/27/2004  After setting forth the question, 'Give me something random to complain about', (which now that I think about is actually a demand, not a question), I chose to listen to Ben over nathan. nathan's idea was to complian about my small penis, which i still attest is bigger than Jake's. Hah, he'll never live that down. Oh, and tonight Jackie enquired whether or not Jake and I are gay together. That made me laugh, of course we are... not, are not.    Ben on the other hand gave me 3 good topics which I shall now piss and moan about.      TARGET:   So I finished my TAKS test before most people in my room evolved to the point where they used pencils. After a good 2 hour nap, I awoke to a slight krotchal vibration. That would be target calling. Apparently my background check hasn't gone in. I really wanted to just say, 'DO YOU THINK I'MA DRUG HEAD?'. But I chose not to. This doesn't make sense to me though, Rand turned in his application and pee cup a day after I did, and has been working for a week. Likewise, Ben turned in his application and pee cup 2 weeks after I and already has a schedule. WTF mate?    Another reason for complaint are the stupid Orientation videos I was subjigated to. It's like i was in the HJ being told to worship hitler and hate jews. 2 things which Ido not do anymore... or ever in the past. They were al fluffy and gay and I felt like my manhood was being stripped from me subconciously. One of the demonstrations was to help 'buckle up infants in the shopping cart'. Basically you have a child molesting 50 year old approach a shopper and attempt to buckle them up. Here's what I'd do if I was the parent:    Creepy Diddler (dad's term for molester): *looks at infant* Say bucko, would you mind buckling up for me?    Me: What in the hell? Who are you? Get away from my kid. RAPE!!! SECURITY!!! *grabs closest implement of destruction* Take this you dirty Sonofab***h!!! *Wacks diddler in face with stick*    Security comes and witnesses dead employee    Guard: Um, sir what happened?    Me: Uh... he had a gun, and touched my child with his penis... uh, yeah.    Guard: Okay, here's ten million dollars to keep you from talking.    I wish all my stories ended with me getting lots of money.      TAKS:   MOTHER OF GOD! If I could set the TAKS building on fire, I most certainly would. It makes no sense to me at all to raise the difficultly of the stupid standardized test, but then lower the standards for passing. And not only that, but I had to go through a insanely dumb space training program to 'learn how to take the TAKS test'. Which is no different than the damndable TAAS test. If I was he-man, i would (and seriously, this happened in one of hte older episodes), Dig my hands into the earth, and hurdle whatever chunkd of earth the 'TAKS building' is attached to into orbit. (seriously, he basically just threw a power plant into outer space, Heman is a hoss).    But since my only super power is my sexy voice...    Guard approaches    Guard: What the hell are you doing, this is a well secured TAKS area... you filth aren't allowed in    Me (in sexy black voice): Oooh yeah, I'm thinking you need to look over there for some loooovin'. *points away from self* Guard looks away. *kicks guard in krotch and proceeds to do this to every guard in building*    Slightly attractive, but middle aged TAKS woman leader person: How did you get past the guards?    Me (sexy voice still active): Let's just say I...say, you're onefoxy lady. how about you set this building on fire, and wecango back to my place... OOOH YEAH!!! SWEETLOVIN'.    *woman sets building on fire, followed by me kicking her in krotch and running off into sunset*      JOHN KERRY:   He's a stupid liberal, abortion supporting Catholic. Damn dirty catholics... wait NO!      Get ready for my mad grrr...            Dark City Treno... - 5/5/2004  Very rarely am I inspired to write. Usually it's when I'm mad and need something to complain about. Sadly enough, whenever I feel like total crap and want to kill myself, Examples being Quiznos and rib tickler, everyone has a jolly good laugh. Maybe my misfortune is hilarious, I dont know. But that is not the topic at hand.    It's about 1:30 am, I'm close to finishing up my English CC final (which I am damn proud of as of now). I've been thinking of a way to express my feelings towards/about Jackie. I've referenced to her in several entries, whereas her last 5 or 6 have practially been exclusivly geared towards me. Haha, i'm so lucky.    Love. No, I couldn't possibly make such a claim so soon into knowing her. I once thought I could, but I soon realized how childish and arrogant that would be. I love many people, but I will have my 'Love' resereved for but one person in this world, who I may not even know yet. Regardless, she is on my mind when I wake up, when I go to sleep, when I take my tests, when I pray. To use amatrix quote to describe her presence in my mind:      'You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.', Morpheous    I felt really crappy when I couldn't take her to bible study today. We go to different schools so I rarely get to see her. For her birthday (may 9th), i'm taking her out this saturday, and I know the word, 'uberromanticest-date' has been thrown around alot lately, but I can safely say this will indeed be the uberromanticest-date ever. Haha, that was a simpsons reference. Yeah, she still has NO idea what we're doing... and to a lesser extent teh same hold trues for me. Meh, Oh well. Just felt like writing this down so she knows how i feel. Farewell my friends.     Time to finish my english...       Before I die... - 5/5/2004  I was reading over a note jake left me a while back, and it made me think of what I'd do before I died... BAsically this is my last day on earth, and the cops have basically said I can do whatever the heck i want. Yeah, I'm cool like that.    So I start off my day to a nice bowl of Apple Jacks, get showered, typical routine. Here is where my day kicks off    I go to my local wal mart, and purchase a trench coat and a gun with lots of bullets. Yeah, you can buy guns at walmart now. Jake can tag along if he wants, basically most of my day will include me shooting stuff with my gun and saying cool stuff like, 'You're dead...', 'let's get the hell out of here', and of course, my all time favorite, 'let's go'.    I'd then pick Smith up, and drive to somewhere where we have a nice city block free, and its raining of course. jake, who is still tagging along mind you, has a stereo with 'Neodammurung' in playing really loudly. And if there's no lightning he'll have ot make thunder sounds too. Jake's a good guy, I like him enough. Anyway, I walk up to Smith and say, 'it ends tonight'. We start running at each other in the rain preparing to get in a big kung fu fight. But before he reaches me I pull out my gun and wail on him. Haha, I play dirty.    So then I go to Jackie's. Jake could still be with me... hell if I know. We then 'drive off into the sunset'... Hmm, towards, OH YEAH! For whatever reason, Smith is actually quite alive and in the last 2 hours came to the control of a big crime syndicate. Well, I leave jackie in my car, tell her i'm 'going out for some gum'. I walk into the crime syndicate and systematically blow everything up. Smith is at the top waiting with a sword for some reason, yeah, i blow that up too and shoot him again. I stumble down because I let some bullets hit me I guess. Federal agents are standing outside waiting for me with guns and stuff, yeah, about to kill me. I lift up my hand and before collapsing and dying say...      Bang...       Don't be a dentist drill... - 5/6/2004  So today in history class, the year almost done winding down. My final test is tomorow (which I am well prepared for). Fisher decided to leave our class with but one last sermon containing the greatness of her infinite knowledge of this realm. The topic, 'dont be a dentist drill'. It basically said, 'don't complain to people a lot because you have no idea what circumstances surround their outside life'. She obviously used the example of bugging a teacher about getting grades. I mean after all, the teacher may have cancer, a cheating spouse, or maybe they spent an entire weekend in devotion to others. I think the sermon was infact very true, I dont know the personal life of my teachers and sometimes my friends, and in many cases, I either dont want to know or dont care.    Good message, wrong person to deliver this message. Fisher, in my personal opinion, has two eyes, one is fake, and only sees what goes on inside the walls of her classroom. the other one is the gossipy eye, which can only see the dirt that others surround themselves in. So unless you do very well in her class, or just happen to have the lastest scoop on who got drunk/or pregnant the weekend prior, you are disliked. Ben and I are perfect examples of this. Fisher doesn't have the damndest clue what any of us, especially I do with my life.    Enter February Challenge. I delievered my Prayer talk, 30ish minutes if my prediction is correct, pretty indamntense. I was dead bug that weekend, maybe got 8 good hours of sleep. I was doing good for others I'd like ot think, I may not have had any converts in my small group this time, but I pretend i made a difference. The monday following challenge, Fisher slaps some boring and moronic packet on our desks (probably had to do with feminism or some other useless peice of history, haha, j/k).    Before I go any further, I would like to comment that this infact an unfabricated story, this is true as can be. So I begin to nod off and lay my head on my desk knowing full well Fisher allows for everyone to come in after school and complete their packets. While I am attempting to sleep, some drunkard DIRECTLY in front of me is LOUDLY conversing about his sexcapades and intoxicating weekend. Fisher looks directly at me and goes, 'bryan, since you have chosen to not do your packet today, I will not allow you to come after school to work on it, period.' Let's just ignore the fact that I probably accomplished more on that packet than the drunkard in front of me. Those minor details are of little importance. So I show up after school to attempt my packet, I was slightly more fresh that time... Fisher screams at me to get out, but on my way out the door, I notice the drunkard from before is dilligantly working on his packet. Injusitice anyone?    Am I mad because my weekend was spent doing something more... ethical than the drunkard's? No. Am I mad because Fisher most likely attends church simply for the satisfaction of refuting the word of God given her feminine omnipotence? No. (but i think she's so damn full of herself its amazing she doesnt float away). I am mad as HELL because Fisher NEVER practices what she preaches. She is a GREAT teacher whom I've learned a hella lot from, but a BAD person. It's a damn surprise that woman got married, what how high her horse is and her adamant hatred for men. Oh, and she supports abortion.      I dont bitch or moan, I rake muck...         Melodies of life part I... - 5/6/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.   I do not consider myself an attractive person. All that 'lord of cute' rhetoric is mostly just compensation. I believe I would become enraged and kill if I was forced to spend long periods of time with myself. I can be an ass sometimes, if that irregularly.    I am not a 'ladies man'. I've had 4 relationships during the entirty of my life, probably accumulating to two months of being in a relationship. I've prayed more than most to be with someone. Heck, I've probably put forth four rosaries (most cherished form of prayer) to try and find inspiration or something. Patience, that's all i come up with.    One week or so this girl contacts me. I had wanted to start a relationship with her in the past, but she basically cut off all contact with me and was more of a socialite than i was to begin with. So out of the blue she wants me to go out with her. At this point in time, I suspected nothing would hurt, I suppose that was just one of my weak moments in ethics. So I agreed to the date. It was supposed to be right before battle of the bands. My shift didnt start until 7pm so I figured I could sit and chat with her for a while.    You could say it was wednesday before that inspiration struck me. I was getting into this for the wrong reasons. Thursday I explained how I'd have to cancel so I could go to church earlier. This was not a lie, it was an escape you could say. I guess you could say i'm trying to be a better person.    I took a nap after school friday. Meant to wake up around five. Woke up around 6:30. Speddown to church, paid my ten dollars to volunteer. Never did quite understand that. I go to check out where I'm working, and then search for someone to socialize with. Since I have so few friends at PoP, that tends to be difficult. First person I see is Sam and her posse of girls. I ask her about the Matrix which I had recently shown to her, and then proceed to ask if any of her friends had seen it. One of her friends jumps from the bench and nearly tackles me screaming, 'I HAVE!!!'. So we sat down and conversed about it for a while, Sam took off somewhere. She told me her name, I didnt really remember. Cute girl though, coulda sworn she was a junior.    Afterwords, I leave to go deliver a flashlight to the entrance. It was getting pretty dark. I saw Em and Stephanie there, good friends, so we chatted about this and that for a while. My pants started to vibrate, it was chris. Not much of a surprise. he calls alot. So I pick up and he says, 'where areyou, we need to talk'... we need to talk alot apparently. So he comes, snatches me from the entrance and I ask what the topic of conversation is. 'man, she totally likes you!'. Wha, who? 'Uh... samantha's friend'. Oh... who? 'Iduno, I think her name is Jennie or something, Heck, I thought she was our age'. Well okay, lets go see her.    So Chris and I frockle our way over to that Jennie girl, I got detured a little bit, but we reached her eventually. Turns out her name's Jackie. Coulda fooled me. So I start talking to her, and within about 20 seconds she has my cell phone, and putting her number into it. Maybe that's how I learned her name. So this Jen... Jackie girl is making small talk with Chris and i. I think she must have said uber like three times, I thought that was pretty funny. I explain my adamant love for my Atari PoP shirt, and gaming.. and basically everything that isn't cool in this world. Did I explain I'm not a ladies man? At some point I put my number in her phone, she then tells me that, 'i'll never ever call her' or something like that.    Well, the very fact that this cute girl is obviously chasing after me was interesting, so I reply, 'heck, I'll call you as soon as I pull out of the parking lot'. I dont think she believed me.    Battle of the bands came toa close, so Sam, Jackie and the rest of hte posse came to bear witness to the greatness of my crappy car. She sat on the hood in some sort of temptress style. I think that's where Jake jumped on and effectivly scratched off half my car's paint. Jackie and I step out of the crowd to converse about things for a brief period. We sit on the curb and she asks me, 'what'd everyone tell you'. Well, that you have a thing for me I guess. 'oh, well Im pretty forward, so yeah... i'm into you'. Yeah, I suppose I am as well, but I personally would like to take things slowly (goes into boring schpeal). 'yeah, I agree, so are you going to call me?' I said I would.    Then I saw her and Sam's posse off, went to clean up and went to my car. Well, I almost wee'd myself when I discovered a lack of keys in my pocket. I'm jumping up and down, near swearing when Mr. Franz goes, 'hey, are these yours?' Christ, THANK YOU SOO MUCH!!! where'd you find them'oh, over on the curb'. damn...    So I get in my car, and drive off onto 249. I called her and got hervoice mail orsomething. Why do people doubt me so much? So her name's Jackie...      To be continued...       Melodies of life part II... - 5/7/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.    Jackie hmm. Well I go home and log on to AIM, a rare event. Ha. I was talking to Sam and Jackie for a little bit. I think we made plans for me to take her to her Bible study tuesday night.I picked Sam's brain about Jackie. Ya know, what's her ethical base, what crowd circles she's in. That stuff. Apparently during the course of the night, I was refered to as, 'The God of cute', and 'The hottest thing ever'. So I figure any girl who thinks that about me has to be a amazingly brilliant. Ha. My mom probably told me to get offand sleep. I dont think I did. I went to bed eventually.   I called her during that weekend to talk about dumb things. Nothing of any real value, just to talk to her I guess. I wanted to go out, Tuesday I figured. I wanted to do it in person. Got a map to her house, found out I had to commute on 290. Now, to me, 290 is like the Matrix Reloaded freeway. It basically means certain death for me. The very fact that I got to her house unscathed I believe is the direct intervention of God. No saints, no angels. God personally came down to get me there.    Apparently right after Battle of the Bands, she told her mom how she likes me, and how happy I make her. That's cool, my mom didn't find out until having known her for 3 weeks. So I get in her house, recieve a quick tour. Nice house, big and pretty. She had more shoes in her closet than I have in my entire house though. I take her to her brother's baseball game so I could see her mom and younger brother. Her brother is like an allstar athlete, big sports fan. I guess she saw that in me too, what with my complete lack of physical talent and apathy towards sports. Her mom was very sweet, I was pretty goofy. I hoped I made a good impression.    We make our way down 290 again (God still driving) and I had told her the weekend prior that I had a question for her. So she'd kept bugging me about the question and all. First thing I asked her is if she drank. Said she did it once, a year ago. I said, 'i know you hate crying, but the one thing that wouldbring me to tears would be you drinking'. I made her promise not to ever again. She didnt like that, probably thought I didnt trusther. So then my question. 'will you go out with me'. Well of course she said yes, if you didnt know she would you're dumb.    She explains how its hard for her though, she doesn't want her heart broken, she doesn't want me to be disloyal. I look her straight in the eye and with all the sincerity in my body say, 'never again will you have someone as loyal as me. The mere thought of being dishonost, loyal or cheating is so painful to me I cannot even imagine it. And I hope the same holds true for you'.I don't thinkshe believed me.    We get to bible study, which I knew going in would not even compare to Matt's bible studies. But I did it just as an excuse to go see her. I laid next to her on a pillow the whole time. During praise 'n worship I tried to touch her hand, hold it maybe. Yeah, that didn't work out so hot. She kept leaning over saying, 'what do you want?'. Hell, what was I supposed to say? 'PUT YOUR HAND IN MINE NOW!!!' SoI drive her home. And give her a goodbye hug. She might have said she had a great time. Iduno, maybe.    I suspect God got tired of driving me to her house. So within two turns, I realized i had no idea where I was. It was dark and I was in an unknown part of the world. I called ben and Jayci to bitch and yell. I probably swore more that 30 minutes of trying to get out of fairfield than I ever have... ever. After that, I get back on 290 (hell's freeway) and fail to navigate on there as well. I had to exit onto telge, and got lost on that road as well. I got home around ten. I ran upstairs and got online. No jackie. Oh well, I went to bed.    I get a phonecall from her that wednesday. Probably before bible study. She tells me she wants to stop going out. She wants to take things slowly and get to know me better. Follows up by asking if i'm mad five thousand times over. I thought it was sweet. The first break up.    That thursday, I was walking out to my car when this girl (who met me at rib tickler and wants me to ask her out... almost did) asked me for a ride home. Her's had ditched her. I must be physically incapable of not taking people home. I think its a damn disease. So I take her home, and I realize how close I am to 290. So I drop her off and call jackie to inform her i'll be at her house in about ten minutes. Unknown to me, she basically exploded in a firery rage trying to get 'prettied up' before I came over. She looked fine. Jackie and her mom thought my blue shirt that day was hot. I liked the black turtle neck better. She wants to set it on fire.    We go sit by her pool and talk about cats, school and she asks me if im mad at her again. Still pretty cute. Then she comes out and says, 'i'm bad at relationships'. Obviously I inquired why. 'I dont know, I just stop liking a guy after we go out, i'm not sure if I can be a good girlfriend. dont hate me. I'm not sure why'. Well didnt that just put me in a shitty mood. I did my best to put a smile on my face. Nothing's like hearing, 'as soon as we go out, I'll like you less'. I wonder if she noticed how distraught I was. Maybe, she didn't believe I'd be loyal to her.    While I'm driving home, I play 'simple and clean' really loud. in fact, i'm listening to it right now. That's my favorite angsty/happy love song. I tried to hold back my emotions. It was easy waiting a few months before we go out, I couldn't possibly stand waiting a few months and then realizing she doesnt like me. I think she likes me, I mean she thinks i'm attractive for some reason, and laughs at me on occasion.    I got home and sat on my toilet listening to Navras, putting my mind in order, trying to figure out what the hell I'm doing wrong or what I should be doing. So I wrote, 'my thoughts while listening to Navras'. Shortly thereafter,I went downstairs to eat, and watched TV with dad for a few hours, now that was a rare occasion. I get upstairs to find I missed 3 or so phonecalls from Jackie, all basically saying how she's so sorry, crying and a bunch of other unhappy things. Well I feel like shit again, this isn't my day. I get online, her live journal says the same thing basically. I called her cell phone, Christ I felt bad. Cell phone was busy, i was hesitant to call her home phone, it was pretty late. Her mom picks up, and says somethign like, 'its okay jackie, shh, its okay'. She was crying in the background. Did I mention the shit i was feeling like?    Through the tears, she tried to explain how she doesn't want to lose me and how i make her feel happy. Less shitty. I must have said 'Jackie... I'm sorry', five hundred times. I know she didnt want me to say it, but I had to. I felt like shit. I tried explaining the intent of that entry. Didnt work to well. I told her I'd never intentionally do anything to hurt her. I'm not sure she believed that either.    I made Jackie cry though. My stomach felt it was going to curl up and explode.     To be continued...        Melodies of life part III... - 5/8/2004    Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark,For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart.To weave by picking up the pieces that remain.Melodies of Life - Love's lost refrain.   I'm not much of a reading fan. Never have been nor will I. So let's skip a few chapters of this novel I call my life. Rand and I are in my car driving away from Jackie's, on our way to Starbucks to continue studying for the history exam. She had called and left a voice message about halfway through the drive. So I pick up my phone and listen Jackie in a rather solemn tone, 'bryan, whenever you are alone, call me. we need to talk'.    Now, any guy wiht a head on their shoulders knows full well what that means. So during the rest of the ride home, I did my best to provide the illusion to Rand that I was just fine. I couldnt understand him as he asked the questions, i was so internally distraught. I tell him to wait for me in starbucks as I call her.    'Bryan, I still think we're moving to fast. I want to get to know you better'. Aren't those just words that put you in a good mood? She still wanted to go out with me for her birthday and red carpet affair though. So I suspected and hoped that there was some flicker of chance left. Didn't I resolve to abandon hope long ago?    I drove up to her house listening to Melodies of Life. I had intended to get her two roses tonight. Glad I didn't. I walk in, give her mom a hug, then Jackie. As we step out the door, I wave good bye to her mom and Jackie says, 'Bryan, we need to talk'. Mokay, I figured we would, wouldnt drive off into the sunset silent anyway. So I open the car door for her and drive off.    'Im sorry bryan. I lied to you, I dont want a boyfriend right now. All I want is a friend. It's not anyone else. Don't be mad at me'. Bull fucking shit. She told me within a few blocks of her house. It took every ounce of willpower left in my frail existence to not turn my car around and drop her off at her doorstep. I pull into AMC 24, and get two tickets for Law of Attraction (13 dollars). Good movie, ironically it dealt with working hard and fighting for relationships. Must not have sunk in. No matter.    I drive her home directly after the movie. I intended to have dinner with her, but I did what I could to get out of that. Didn't feel like paying for dinner, or waiting to get home any longer. I did my best to talk to her. I spoke nothing but rhetoric to her, firstly so my head wouldnt explode with rage, and secondly so she wouldnt feel as bad as I wanted to make her feel. Make her feel as shitty as I did for three days, waiting to find out her answer.    So do I feel cheated for spending a quarter tank of increasingly expensive gas, and 13 dollars on a movie, so I could obtain information that would have better recieved over a 2 minute phone conversation? Yes I do. Am I wildly upset and furious? Yes. Jackie said all she wants is just a friend, but quite frankly, I'd just be another one of her many guy friends. And if she tried to attatched some emotional crap to our 'friendship' than it would cease to be a friendship, and thus becomea a relationship, but that is in fact not waht she wants. She tells me she didnt think i'd want her to be unhappy in the relationship, or lie for that matter. Yet, almost immediatly thereafter she told me she doesn't want me to be angry with her.So should I then lie and say I'm quite alright with her decieving me? Should I lie to her so she is happy?      'Prick us do we not bleed, tickle us do we not laugh, wrong us do we not revenge'.    I am angry that she broke up with me. I was upset when I made her cry the first time, but if she reads this, and understands my true pain and anger and then cries, it is no longer my burden. Law of attraction was about fighting for love, not giving up. I extended myself as far as I could, lept every hurdle, climed every mountain, she did nothing. So no, I shall not cry with her this time, this time I did all that I could, and that it seems, was simply not enough.    So I bid this entry, and chapter of my life farewell, Im off to do the only thing that can brighten my mood. I'm off to game.      In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me?Was it fate that brought us close and now leaves me behind?     And he walks off into the day's sunset, alone...           Movie preview this! (exposes middle finger)... - 5/8/2004  I swear, if there is one especially crappy thing about going to movies, it's not the insane prices, its not paying for a girl who plays on her cell phone the whole time, or someone who broke up with you ten minutes before. Its not even the idiots who are talking and laughing throughout the entire movie (oh wait, that's me). It's those damn previews.    I remember a day long ago when movie previews were no more than ten seconds long and had the most ambiguous trailers. You'd be lucky if they even mentioned the title or leading actors in previews long ago. But now, they basically spell out the plot, from begining to damn end in about five minutes. Not only does it reveal the most action intense scenes, but they so heavily narrate the movie, you might as well download the trailer and be done with it. here's an example of the way it used to be, compared to the way it is now using the Matrix.    *you see the matrix code rush down the screen and then a five second shot of some white guy shooting somebody, face not exposed*    Narrator: On March 31st, you will experience action... Matrix action. Nothing is as it seems.    THATS ALL YOU GOT!!! It gave you just enough so you were slightly interested in the movie, enough to want to go see it in theaters. Now its like a freakin' dragon ball Z preview:    *Matrix code flashes by*    Narrator: In this Sci Fi thriller about a digital dream world pulled over humanities eyes to blind them from a machine's slavery, you will meet Thomas A. Anderson, AKA Neo.    *shows neo awaken in the real world*    Narrator: Neo is thought to beThe One, a special person who is a messiah like figure who can manipulate hte matrix as he sees fit. But is he?    *shows Neo stopping bullets*    Narrator: Will Neo encounter the Oracle, a black lady who can see everything? Will he knock over that vase?    *shows neo knocking over vase*    Narrator: Will Neo fight and win a digital battle against evil programs known as agents, especially his arch enemy and antithesis, agent smith?    *shows Neo fighting smith, and ultimatly killing him*    Narrator: And will Neo become the One after being shot several times in teh chest, and later dying at the hands of Agent Smith?    *shows neo being shot several times by Agent Smith*    Narrator: March 21st, 1999, the matrix will have you...    So there you have it, movie trailers now adays should be shot and thrown into an unquenchable fire.      On the next episode of DragonBall Z...       Liberi Fatali... - 5/11/2004  I'd like to believe I've conducted my search as honostly and purely as I can. I have not devoted myself to a lustful relationship, nor have I conspired a relationship merely out of a physical aspect. I suppose I am too mature for my own good to say that all I want is that special girl i can hold in my arms, until the sun sets. Maybe I'm just too damn desperate. Perhaps I'm just kidding myself, entertaining even the smallest thought that Jackie may actually develop and realize what I mean to her, and her to me. Jake was quick to insult, but his current girlfriend has not always made the most mature decisions, nor have any of us. We are human and make mistakes. I say this without insulting Jake, or raising my sword to defend Jackie. Merely to put each in their place.    I have a friend whom I once believed paralleled me on my search. 'i'm just looking for someone to share my love with'. If words could describe men, than that statement would suffice for him. But nay, his words, though similar to my own, were not honost. He looks not for a relationship as I do, but for a pretty face.A puppy to look at and pet. I on the other hand want a girl who I can look in the eyes of and just be happy to be with her, and her with me. Someone who's hand always finds mine, and knows when I'm not in the best of spirits.    My brother did not meet his fiance' until he was well into college. So it seem somewhat silly to be outraged by my constant misses. Patience. No longer will I pray for the deliverence of my beautiful dame, because I know she will come. But I will and must pray that I can withold my integrity and honor so I can wait for her, and say with a truthful heart that I did in fact wait. Dating is for dumping, as Matt, whom I love, has once and again said. Farwell my friends, I must be off, for the trip is long, and I have wasted so much time waiting for it to come to me.      I don't want to be alone anymore...       Dance of Curse... - 5/18/2004  I gave you my heart. When that wasn't enough, I extended my hand. Still you wanted more. Well you had your two chances. I for damn sure wont' be holding my heart in hand for you. And don't expect me to be watiing at the bus stop for you, it's raining, and I gave you my umbrella too. I was wrong to think you were mature enough to think you could reserve some room in your hollow heart for me. Turns out there's only room for every guy on this cold rock but me. This whole damn thing had to go sour.    You're so full of contradiction.    You assure me I have no reason to be jealous, but hook up with some guy you just met.    You assure me I have no reason to be jealous, but I can't talk to anything with a fucking vagina without you getting mad.    You tell me you do in fact have feelings for me, but fail to mention that doesnt make me special at all.    You tell me you do in fact have feelings for me, but we're just friends.    You say we're more than friends, but only friends.    You say we're more than friends, but I guess Rob's just a friend too.    'don't get mad at me for not knowing what to do about you Bryan', you cry. That being the case, I've overstayed my welcome. I had my fifteen minutes with you, now I yield your affection to the next guy in line. I'm just glad the wait isn't too long.    And don't you dare tell me that you miss me. Don't dare say you'd die if I stopped talking to you, because you still draw breath. And you dont' miss me enough to stay single. Quite frankly, you don't have a damn clue what you want. Don't give me a matter-a-factly when the only fact is that I dont matter.    I did'nt 'give up'. I gave in. All my friends told me you were posion, I didn't believe them, I didn't believe you made me your 'yo-yo'. I didn't want to admit to my parents it was over, because I didn't believe it.    I made you promise you wouldn't drink so long as we were going out. Let a promise keep you from what you want to do. It's null and void, no more. Drink your saddness away, you'll only be crying it back out. Live your own life. You didn't want just 'one man in your life'. So find company with every cock bearing man in this world. Every single one, everyone but me.      And he continues his journey, Xylothin in hand...           Endless Waltz... - 5/19/2004  With each passing year, the excitement of a birthday, the anticipation, fades away. Maybe my life is just becoming one big routine, eventually to be halted by the phenomenon called death. The same holds true for Christmas. Santa either died, or I'm just growing up. I had a shitty birthday.    Friday May 14th, 2004 2:30 PM CST:    After one of my final days of my shortlived junior year, I made my way to Target so I could switch schedules with Rand. He apparently had some band thing on my birthday, so I got the opportunity to work for him. 'come in at 4:00 pm' they said. (Well okay, that gives me enough time to sleep in and what not). I leave, get home and dawn the suit I got for Christmas, I looked damn pimp. Figured I should head over to the Hilton Hotel early and help set up the 'Red Carpet Affair' because I failed to make this gay poster thing. Got there around 4:30,only person dressed up. I helped put a few things together, not much else.    RCA was basically a talent show/dance/awards ceremony. Originally I had intended to take Jackie to this thing. Well, I also originally had intended to go out with this women for more than a week. Apparently I made up some bullshit lie like I was working that day so we couldnt go. (she still wanted to go AFTER breaking up with me, how bout dem apples?). Well I had a free ticket so Vanessa picked it up. She rode with Chris.    The whole deal was entertaining enough. Everyone started dancing to rap, so I exited temporarily. I sat down in a chair outside the reserved room and stared into the night sky. it was about 8:30 or 9. I got to have one of my all too infrequent moments of self contemplation. They are always very calming. It's basically just stepping out of your body and analyzing why you are the way you are. What makes me tick. I think I'm a good person. i'd like to think I'm a work in progress, someone who wants to better himself. I also came into that sense of doubt that's ever lingering in my mind. I wish I was more charsimatic. I have some big shoes to fill next year in PoP, but also some holes to fill in. I suppose my main thought was trying to not be exclusive and hateful like our current senior regime is. It's half trickled down to the juniors, but the sophmores are just great. Hopefully I can extinguish that flame next year.    RCA came to a close, and still feeling as though I had not contributed anything to it, offered to help take it down for Matt and the rest of the crew. I did more manual labor that night than I ever intend to ever again. I hauled more than 5X my weight, not saying that much, but still. It was about midnight and I decided to help take everything from the Hilton hotel back to church. By this time I was the only youth left, it was just Matt, Mr. Jones (AWESOME GUY) Mr. Carpenter (meh, he's an aggie) and me. Just as we finished putting hte last few things in the youth room, I looked at my cell phone and said to myself 'well crap, I'm 17 now'. No one noticed, no happy birthday. I was a little upset.    Saturday May 15th, 2003 12:20pm CST:    I'm freaking tired, my arms hurt, and I hear my phone vibrating. Oh look, its my favorite place of employment, Target. 'yes, well, we need you to come inaround 1:00pm for more training'. Thanks for the heads up. I make my way downstairs for breakfast, sulking and angry. Mom didnt know I was going to work early until i was out the door. No matter. Greg had called and said he couldnt come down for my birthday since I was working. I was a little upset. When I got to work, Tiffane' had called to wish me a happy birthday. 'Well, I just called to say happy birthday, I'll bet you're having a lot of fun right now'. Ha, I laughed so hard when I heard her voicemail. Nate and Chuck dropped by Target around 7 to give me my Bday present. Then they fucked with my cart. i was a little pissed off. Chuck was squeezing his nipple. that was gross, yet slightly humorous. So i freaking worked, for 9 hours on my birthday. And outside of my immediate family, 5 people remembered. Damn horrible day.    Well, as Jake once said, 'A long enough timeline kills anything'. That seems very relevent, what me talking about aging and all. meh, I guess you really only age if you are forgotten.      Enough timeline can defeat all things, even life...       Why get up... - 5/26/2004    Why keep fighting?   For a long time now I have tried to become a chasteful and moral individual. I have done my best to abstain from lust, drinking and other temptations which I know to be wrong. What good has this noble sacrifice gotten me? 'It's really attractive to have stayed a virgin this long, Bryan' Jayci tells me. Wow, look how many unnattractive people there are in this world then. And look at how few there will be when I tie the knot. 'Don't you ever just want to go out and have fun. Lose control?'    Yes. At times my morale and resolve is low. At times I want to shed my ethics and simply 'live for the moment'. But nay, I refuse to believe that doing something so selfish is worthwhile. Yet, in a world where that is but the norm, what good is it? I ask for justification of my own actions. Someone explain to me why I dont go out and have fun like the rest. Why do I not do these things when I am not a role model. When my actions are not regarded highly in any form or fashion. Why carry this cross, that so many others have abandoned? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe going out, becoming intoxicated and making out with some person you just met is holy and moral.    Maybe everything I've ever lived my life for is but a deception. Maybe Love is just some insipid invention. Some febel construct of a weak human intelect.    But maybe I'm right. I just want to know why I am, and what worth it is to be right. What good is a Paladin when his castle crumbles around him? What good is an ethical person when ethics cease to be?      Do you believe you're fighting for something...     Waltz for Venus... - 5/26/2004  I sit here at my computer gazing at His Dark Materials. A Trilogy I recently purchased at the inspiration of my friends Jake and Nathan. I can recall, last year Jake having just finished reading it, explaining what a great trilogy it is, how it has a fantastic love story. Once more I gaze at the books, and above the title it clearly displays the books' genre. 'Fantasy'.    It's all, just a dream.    Love, that ever elusive Unicorn. Just over the horizon. Perhaps it is just a fantasy. Perhaps this journey has been nothing more than an Odyssey without an Ithaka. So I sit here, staring blankly at my computer screen, words appearing at my very will. Only words.    Not everyone gets married. Not everyone finds love. Few I suppose do. How lucky they must be, do they even realize it?    Again I see people who are constantly in a relationship, rarely with the same person. Does that mean anything? Is that love, does that make them happy? It wouldn't make me happy, that much is true. Sure, the void would be filled, but with each passing girlfriend. With each passing love, that void would only swell.      See you space cowboy...                              "
"             CHAPTER 1  [Benâs P.O.V.] I whistled to myself feeling sexier then ever while I winked at the passing girlsâ¦they seemed to show some interest in me tooâ¦secretly I smirked to myself knowing I, Benjamin Uy was literally a chick magnetâ¦  As I whistled and threw my car keys in the air I accidentally bumped in to someoneâ¦  âOh sorry sirâ a muffled, feminine voice saidâ¦  I was stunned for a few seconds before I peered down at the girlâ¦she seemed about my age but her hair covered her face from my viewâ¦I could just make out two large hazel eyesâ¦she seems pretty hotâ¦but briskly walked away after apologizing to meâ¦  âRight back at ya sexy!â I hollered at her as she walked past meâ¦  She didnât seem to notice my extremely handsome features or my sparkling smileâ¦I began to worryâ¦was I growing oldâ¦but Iâm only 23â¦ surely I canât have a wrinkle now can I?  I rushed to the nearest shop to find a mirrorâ¦Mc Donaldâs was the closest and I barged in and knocked a few plates out of customers who were walking to a tableâ¦I didnât careâ¦.they were the least of my problemsâ¦my looks were everythingâ¦everything!  As I neared the guysâ toilets I kicked the swinging door open not bothering to check if anybody was behind itâ¦Frantically I rushed to the nearest mirror to inspect my faceâ¦to my relief nothing was wrongâ¦the same sexy face peered right back at meâ¦  It felt great to see a handsome guy stare back at meâ¦I sighed to myself feeling better than everâ¦I decided to brand that girl a lesbian since she didnât seem the slightest bit moved by my good looksâ¦  Slowly I strolled over acting cool to the door of the guysâ toiletsâ¦I must have tripped on some water and I fell flat on my faceâ¦my world felt like it had crashed right down, how embarrassingâ¦silently I cursed about that girl who had knocked into meâ¦as my eyes adjusted and I attempted to get up a foot slammed right onto my backâ¦I winced in painâ¦What the hell was going onâ¦who ever did that was going to payâ¦my shirt was ruinedâ¦and even worse he could of made me permanently retarded with an imprint on my perfect body!!! Who would want me nowâ¦  âWho the hell are you?!â I demanded in pain as I lay on the tiles smelling the disgusting odor of urineâ¦  I turned my head a few inches to the side to see who to blameâ¦a tall figure peered over meâ¦his face was red and he seemed like he had just had a swim in the toilet bowlâ¦  âThe guy behind the door when you kicked it openâ he said with an evil smirk on his faceâ¦  Uh-oHâ¦Iâm in trouble nowâ¦I thought to myselfâ¦again I cursed at that bloody girl who hadnât noticed meâ¦if it wasnât for her than I wouldnât be in this mess right nowâ¦with an extremely bulky guy hovering over me with heaps of tattoos everywhere you could imagineâ¦  I had to admitâ¦it didnât seem like I could take this humongous mass of muscle onâ¦I meanâ¦I was pretty strong myself but this guy was so massive he could flatten meâ¦the odds were great and it didnât look pretty in the endâ¦  If you can imagine meâ¦a beautiful faced guy walking into the gents toilets in a hurryâ¦and then me, walking out like I had just being bashed to a pulp and had my head flushed down the toiletâ¦it wasnât prettyâ¦believe meâ¦  As I walked outâ¦for the first time in my life I felt uglyâ¦.all the girls turned to look my wayâ¦this time it wasnât because of my charming smile or killer looksâ¦but the stench of urine all over me and the numerous bruises I had all over my faceâ¦  Like a zombie I made my way out, slowly lugging my tired body out Mc Donaldâs until somebody approached meâ¦  âExcuse me sirâ¦â a man askedâ¦he was wearing the Mc Donaldâs uniform and he had a badge on the left side of his chest labeled âmanagerââ¦.  Drowsily I turned my head signaling him to go onâ¦  âIâm sorry but the customers have complained about youâ¦Iâve been informed that you knocked over their food while you apparently rushed into the gentsâ toiletsâ¦â he said in an accusing toneâ¦  My heart began to thumpâ¦donât tell me he was going to make me payâ¦I groaned to myself not wishing to part with my moneyâ¦  âUmmâ¦you have the wrong guyâ I said quickly while I motioned to the door again like a zombieâ¦.  He held me back with his hand before quickly withdrawing it away in disgustâ¦my shirt was soaked in toilet waterâ¦it didnât smell nice at allâ¦  âPlease sirâ¦if you would kindly pay the amount of $30.00 for the food that you spilt it would be appreciatedâ¦please donât lie to me or Iâll have to take you to the police stationâ¦I can understand that you had a major case of diarrhea or something like that but the customers want justiceâ¦â the man saidâ¦  I was horrified and extremely embarrassedâ¦they think I had diarrhea!!!...OMGâ¦my swollen face turned even redder than beforeâ¦I wanted to get out of Mc Donaldâs as soon as possible but seeing as the stupid manager wouldnât let me leave I quickly rummaged through my pants pocket to find my walletâ¦  To my horror and shock I couldnât find it anywhere.....i checked both pockets of my baggy jeans and to no avail I found nothingâ¦not even my cell phone was in thereâ¦my eyes widened in shock as I began to panicâ¦what the hell was going onâ¦this wasnât the best day obviouslyâ¦  The managerâs piercing eyes made my forehead drip with beads of sweatâ¦he impatiently waited for me to pay the feeâ¦while I rummaged for my walletâ¦where was it?!  Finally I gave upâ¦slowly I withdrew my hand from my pocket and gave the manager a nervous laughâ¦he stared at me obviously not impressed at all while he tapped his foot continuously on the freshly mopped tilesâ¦  âHold onâ¦I seem to have left my wallet in the bathroomâ   I made a bolt for it to the bathroom hoping that my wallet was thereâ¦I clearly recall that the bulky guy hadnât taken my moneyâ¦or my cellâ¦when I reached the bathroom I slowly pushed the door open which made a squeaky sound from the old hingesâ¦ I searched in every toilet dorm and every table sinkâ¦nothingâ¦nothingâ¦thatâs when I remembered that lesbian girlâ¦urgHâ¦.silently I cursed to myself coming up with the conclusion that she had mugged me when she bumped into meâ¦damn her!...  I glumly walked out of the gentsâ toilets and back to the awaiting hands of the managerâ¦today just wasnât my day at allâ¦first I get bashedâ¦then told to part with my moneyâ¦and now I find out that Iâve been muggedâ¦I sighed to myself not feeling good at allâ¦if I ever see that girl again sheâll payâ¦.  The day didnât turn out as I had plannedâ¦the manager made me work off the $30 I owedâ¦I didnât do much of a good job thoughâ¦I practically slowed down his business and I drove the customers away with my fowl stenchâ¦I felt like I was on showâ¦all these hot girls walked in and out of Mc Donaldâs pointing at me and laughingâ¦I promised myself I would seek revenge on that girl if it was the last thing I didâ¦    CHAPTER 2  [Ben's P.O.V.] At the end of the day I was fully exhaustedâ¦I drove home to my apartment and tiredly opened my apartment door #463â¦as I got in the lights were already onâ¦now what is it? As a frown appeared on my faceâ¦this just wasnât my day to get burgledâ¦then I heard laughterâ¦the T.V. was onâ¦  My eyes widened in panic as I got a nearby beer bottle from the table that I had finished off last nightâ¦slowly I crept beside the wall and neared the T.Vâ¦who ever it was, they were pretty stupid to laugh so loud in my homeâ¦  âHAHAHAHAHAâ the laughter rang through my whole houseâ¦  Just as I was about to strikeâ¦something stopped meâ¦wait a secondâ¦that laugh sounds familiarâ¦I scratched my head in deep concentrationâ¦where had I heard that laugh fromâ¦that same high-pitched girly laughâ¦Tonti!!!...  I smirked to myself knowing I had got him this timeâ¦as usual Tonti, who lived right across from my door had let himself in againâ¦his T.V. was broken and knowing Tonti he was to lazy to get it fixedâ¦he had a room mate tooâ¦Jakeâ¦we were all friends around hereâ¦our other buddyâs lived a few doors downâ¦the short guy. Rainer lived at #465â¦ Blue was at #466, right next door to Tonti and Jake and Retchi lived with Blueâ¦he was the baby out of usâ¦  I thought of an evil plan and smirked at myself thinking I had got him this timeâ¦slowly I crept behind the living room couch and switched the light offâ¦Tonti just sat there dumbfounded wondering what was going onâ¦  Thatâs when I pounced on himâ¦  âARGHhHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! RAPIST!!!â Tonti yelled at the top of his lungsâ¦  I covered his mouth with my hand trying to muffle his soundsâ¦this was way too much fun...knowing Tontiâ¦he kicked and screamed like a baby trying to fight me offâ¦  âSMELLY RAPIST!!!!...HELP!!!! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â He yelled againâ¦  He must have escaped from my graspâ¦his screams were so screeching I would of punched him in the face if he wasnât my friendâ¦suddenly somebody pounced on me and threw me on the groundâ¦.  âARGH!!!â I shrieked as I landed on the floor with a thudâ¦I grabbed my side, aching in painâ¦what the hell was going onâ¦who was that?...  âGet him!!!â Tonti yelledâ¦  Somebody threw a blanket of some sort over my face as I yelled in astonishmentâ¦what the hell?...  Now it was my turn of tortureâ¦Somebody pounced on me while I was still in shockâ¦and Iâm guessing Tonti joined inâ¦  âAHHhHH!!! Get OFF!!!!!!!!!!!â I yelled threw the blanket as they started beating meâ¦  Tonti was going to die for thisâ¦.  Between the blanket and the other twoâ¦I could hear faint soundsâ¦they seemed to be talking about meâ¦  âWhat are we going to do with the burglar?â a guy saidâ¦he sounded like Jakeâ¦  âI donât knowâ¦who ever he isâ¦he sure is dangerousâ¦did you see that?!! He almost raped me for Godâs sake!!! Heâs probably been stalking meâ¦who knowsâ¦even fantasizing!!!â Tonti shrieked in panic  âI donât knowâ¦should we call Ben and tell him about the psycho?â Jake said not knowing what to doâ¦  Obviously he was over exaggerating like usualâ¦I sighed to myself before taking a deep breathâ¦  âSHIN TONTI AND DHONGWAN JAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR FAT ASSES OFF OF ME BEFORE I BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU FOR RUINING MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â I roared at the top of my lungsâ¦  I must have startled the two and they immediately jumped off of my ribs enabling me to breathe in regularlyâ¦  I pulled the covers off of my face as the lights soon turned on and blinded meâ¦as I adjusted to the light I met the gaze of Jake and Tonti wide-eyed and mouths dropped at the sight of meâ¦  âBEN!!!!!!!!!â they both cried in unisonâ¦  âWHAT?!â I said back rather rudelyâ¦  âd-did we do THATâ¦.â Tonti said while glancing at Jake then back at meâ¦  I groaned to myself and got up with a heavy sighâ¦this just wasnât my dayâ¦Tonti followed me along with Jakeâ¦they continued to observe my face taking a good look at the bruises that I got from the bulky guy in the gentâs roomâ¦  I ignored there stares and went to the bathroom to have a long shower before going to bedâ¦today was a long dayâ¦and if I ever saw that girl again Iâd show her a piece of my mindâ¦     CHAPTER 3  [Nickyâs P.O.V.] Before I went to workâ¦I noticed a stupid looking guy walking towards me...he seemed like the perfect person to mugâ¦I meanâ¦donât get me wrongâ¦Itâs not as if I want to steal from anyoneâ¦itâs because I have toâ¦ever since I left the orphanage and when times are hard I have to do it every now and thenâ¦it sure beats being a whoreâ¦  When I âaccidentallyâ bumped into him he called me sexyâ¦I mean...what sort of a lame pick up line is thatâ¦little did that bimbo know that he had just been muggedâ¦I smirked to myself as I thought of what had happenedâ¦  After I took his wallet and cell phone I rummaged through his wallet to find out his name was Benjamin Uyâ¦he seemed like a rich guy judging by the way he walkedâ¦soon I found out I was way offâ¦WHAT?! Only $5?!...this guy must be a pimp if he only has 5 in his wallet but dresses like a rich assâ¦what an idiotâ¦  Of course I was disappointed to only see 5 bucksâ¦I meanâ¦how was that going to pay for the rent that I owedâ¦I frowned to myself as I thought about what I had didâ¦ mugging someone who was as poor as meâ¦I felt guiltyâ¦.  I went to work at 11:00pmâ¦the usual timeâ¦well the pay was goodâ¦but I always got it lateâ¦which wasnât very goodâ¦what could you expect for being a âbar girlââ¦I worked at Crystal Barâ¦I donât know why I took the job thoughâ¦I guess I was desperateâ¦the people there were alright and they treated me pretty nicelyâ¦but that wasnât enoughâ¦after allâ¦I did lose my dignityâ¦  I worked till early morning until 4:00amâ¦it was always like this for meâ¦I was always the fill-in girl as well if people were busyâ¦I needed all the money I gotâ¦and that was only for the rent and bills that needed to be paidâ¦the grueling hours at work were endlessâ¦constantly being harassed and hooted at wasnât what I pictured my dreamâ¦I donât think it would be any girls dreamâ¦  Some guys offered me some cashâ¦but of course, knowing guysâ¦they always wanted something in returnâ¦I cherished that little bit of dignity I had left in me thoughâ¦never would I stoop so lowâ¦I told myselfâ¦so thatâs how I came into the stealing businessâ¦I only did it occasionally when times were hardâ¦  After a while of thoughtâ¦I decided to sell the walletâ¦I easily sold it to a stupid guy who paid $50 for itâ¦I grinned to myself happilyâ¦knowing $50 would last me a whileâ¦I got $100 a night for working and I went to work every chance I gotâ¦I guess you could say that would be more than enoughâ¦but to meâ¦it wasnâtâ¦I hated the job but it kept me aliveâ¦I wanted to create my dreamâ¦.to create a future for myselfâ¦to start new and go to collegeâ¦to get a decent jobâ¦  When my shift was over I went home to my small apartmentâ¦.i punched in the number code and slowly dragged my tired body up to the elevatorâ¦I pushed in the 5th level as the doors closedâ¦  When I finally reached the right floor I slowly pulled my body forward while leaning against the wall half asleep to #005 my apartment numberâ¦ when I got in, I managed to make it to my bedroom and I slumped on my bedâ¦.i was so tiredâ¦it was how it always wasâ¦I fell asleepâ¦.  When I woke up it was 3:00pmâ¦I yawned and stretched my arms out feeling more refreshedâ¦I still had make up on my face and my hair was all ruffled upâ¦scratching my head lazily I walked out of my room to come face to face with my living habitsâ¦I groaned to myself remembering that I had said that I would clean it up yesterdayâ¦  On the floor were scattered clothes and a few empty bottles and chip packetsâ¦on the table was more food and a couple bits of scrap paperâ¦the kitchen sink was a mess with dirty dishes that had been there for God knows how longâ¦I frowned at the disgusting sightâ¦I never noticed how gross it lookedâ¦  Immediately I set to work cleaning everything upâ¦first I picked up all the empty bottles and chip packets before throwing away the scrap pieces of paperâ¦I borrowed a vacuum cleaner from my next door neighbour who was a kind old ladyâ¦I got to work in getting every corner and crevice cleanâ¦  I stepped back to admire my effortsâ¦I had to admit, it looked pretty goodâ¦I smiled at my achievement before I glanced at my watchâ¦9:30pmâ¦.I frowned at how fast time had pastâ¦soon Iâd have to go to work againâ¦I sat on my couch and switched on the small T.V. I possessedâ¦aimlessly I flicked the channels and found my favourite show onâ¦Friendsâ¦after the show finished it was 10:30â¦I slumped on the couch comfortably for a while before I decided to make myself something to eatâ¦  Taking out a pack of Nissin noodles I poured some hot water inside a bowl and covered the top with the foilâ¦while I sat on a nearby stool waiting for the noodles to soften I drummed my fingers while staring at the clockâ¦tickâ¦tickâ¦.tickâ¦it was so boringâ¦  When it had been 5 minutes I opened the lid staring at the steaming hot noodlesâ¦my eyes lit up as I breathed in the delicious smellâ¦mmâ¦.yummyâ¦  After I finished my meal I wiped my mouth with my sleeve and gulped down the last of the scrumptious noodlesâ¦I turned to the clock again and saw that it was 11:45 nowâ¦  Quickly I grabbed my jacket and ran out of my house to Crystal Barâ¦I didnât have a car so I had to go everywhere by footâ¦when I finally reached my destination I huffed and puffed loudly trying to catch my breath backâ¦I glanced at my watchâ¦11:55pmâ¦I gave out a sigh of relief knowing that I wasnât lateâ¦  When I entered the bar I was greeted with the usual loud disco music and heavy smell of liquor that always came my wayâ¦the smell was so thick it made me feel like vomiting the first time I worked hereâ¦but now it was a usual routineâ¦  I greeted the bar tender who was also my boss and went to the back to get changedâ¦busily I searched for number 7 on the clothes rackâ¦I managed to find it right at the end and I undressed to my undergarmentsâ¦when I put the skimpy outfit on I felt bare and nakedâ¦I had never gotten used to thatâ¦the uniform barely covered any part of my bodyâ¦it was an extremely tight, not to mention short mini skirt with a tube top which showed my belly buttonâ¦  I sighed to myself and began to apply make upâ¦there was even a special method for applying it onâ¦I was told to apply a large amount of bright red lipstick to match my outfit with a lot of blush on the cheeksâ¦I might not be a whoreâ¦but I sure feel like oneâ¦  After I finished with my make up I walked out of the dressing room back to the crazy drunks outsideâ¦I envied the rich guys and girls who came hereâ¦they came to party, drink and go wildâ¦they had no idea what kind of future they were throwing aroundâ¦of course there were the occasional girls would make rude remarks about meâ¦they always insulted the less fortunate peopleâ¦they made me so angryâ¦once I slapped one of themâ¦the boss warned me if I ever did that again Iâd get firedâ¦as much as I wanted to lash out at them, I needed the job for the money so I kept quiteâ¦they would always refer to the less fortunate asâ¦ âPeople like youââ¦  After I served a few more beers and to people at tables a group of guys walked inâ¦I noticed one of them instantlyâ¦the guy I had muggedâ¦suddenly I began to panic but I kept my cover and went around serving beers to people while I secretly eyed them making sure I was a far distance from themâ¦  The bar tender told me to serve table 4âs drinks...and I quietly obeyed taking the order and walking towards number 4â¦to my shock and horrorâ¦it was that idiotâs tableâ¦  I quickly placed the drinks on the table and briskly walked awayâ¦I let out a deep sigh of relief thinking I had gotten away with being caughtâ¦.untilâ¦  âHeyâ¦you with the red mini skirtâ¦.come back hereâ¦â it was that idiotâs voice againâ¦  Beads of sweat began to drip from my forehead and my heart began to beat faster and fasterâ¦slowly I turned around hoping he didnât remember meâ¦    CHAPTER 4  [Ben's P.O.V.] The guys and I decided to go to Crystal Bar the next dayâ¦I gave Tonti and Jake the impression that they had damaged my faceâ¦they wanted to make it up to me and take me outâ¦obviously I agreed, who would pass up the opportunity of FREE drinks?...besides, my wallet and phone was stolenâ¦  Iâm a cheap guyâ¦yes, I can admit itâ¦to myself of courseâ¦not to anyone elseâ¦well, yes I flirt but I donât buy drinks for girlsâ¦I expect them to buy drinks for meâ¦hahahaâ¦I mean, why should I buy drinks for girlsâ¦itâs meant to be the manly thing but most girls who hang around bars are usually rich anywayâ¦they can afford to part with their moneyâ¦  Iâm not in debt or anythingâ¦I just donât like wasting moneyâ¦I donât know whyâ¦I just donâtâ¦  When the guys and I finally arrived at Crystal Barâ¦the place was lively with the smell of liquorâ¦people were shouting at each other trying to get a decent conversation starting over the loud DJ music and cheerful screams of young, under-aged girlsâ¦  This was my styleâ¦where I belongâ¦Iâm the heart of the partyâ¦all I have to do is bust a few of my moves and the girls will be hovering over me like Iâm Godâ¦this was my lifeâ¦I was the life of the partyâ¦   Jake and Tonti ordered the beers for usâ¦all the guys were hereâ¦including Rainer, BLue and Retchiâ¦  The bar girl that came over was really hotâ¦I smirked to myself while thinking I had gotten the girls attentionâ¦no, waitâ¦not thinkingâ¦knowingâ¦  To my surprise and astonishmentâ¦she placed down the drinks on the table and leftâ¦she didnât even collect the billâ¦I called out to her and she stopped in her tracksâ¦for a while I thought she was shocked that I, Benjamin Uy had noticed her and she was flatteredâ¦I smirked to myself...satisfied that I still had the charmâ¦  I waited for her to grasp the concept that she had been addressed by âmeâ so she could turn aroundâ¦  Finally she turned around but her head tilted downwards avoiding my eyesâ¦as if she was scared of meâ¦slowly she walking towards my table with the guys againâ¦there was something unusual about herâ¦I felt like I had seen her from somewhereâ¦somewhere recentlyâ¦but I couldnât quite pinpoint whenâ¦  âArenât you going to collect the bill?â I asked her, still trying to remember where I had seen her beforeâ¦  She remained silent not moving an inchâ¦then after a few moments she spokeâ¦  â$13.85 pleaseâ she said in a small muffled voiceâ¦  Tonti had to lean closer to hear herâ¦he sighed loudly seeming fed upâ¦I guess he was in a bad mood because of earlier on when Jake and him had versed each other in rock, scissors, paper to see who had to pay the billâ¦obviously Tonti lost â¦the bar girl noticed his actions but said nothing and kept quietâ¦she most probably assumed that he was annoyed with herâ¦  Her voice sounded so familiarâ¦I was on the brink of finding out where I had seen her beforeâ¦but I just couldnât rememberâ¦  âI guess your new hereâ¦I donât know why a girl like you is doing here but next time, donât forget to collect the bill or youâll be in trouble with your bossâ¦okay?â Tonti saidâ¦noticing that he had acted rather rudely beforeâ¦he gave her a warm smile after handing her the moneyâ¦  Thatâs it!!!...I know who she is!!...that girl who had mugged meâ¦I smirked to myself knowing I had got her this timeâ¦I opened my mouth to show her a piece of my mind, when she interruptedâ¦  âThatâs right!!! You wouldnât know anything about why a girl like âMEâ is doing here so mind your own bloody business!!! .you donât even know anything about meâ¦you have no ideaâ¦all you guys are just a bunch of rich assholes who donât appreciate the great advantages you have in life!!!â she burst out in aggravationâ¦emphasizing the word âMeâ as if Tonti was judging herâ¦  Tonti's eyes widened in shock at how the girl had changed all of a suddenâ¦first she was quite and seemed unsure of herselfâ¦but now she was fired upâ¦I was surprised myselfâ¦  'L-lookâ¦I didnât mean it that way okayâ¦and please donât assume weâre that kind of peopleâ¦you donât know usâ¦and we donât know youâ¦â Tonti said calming down a littleâ¦  Tonti and Blue could manage their temper so easily out of all of usâ¦Jake was quite calm but he had a temper problem sometimesâ¦  Rainer became cold and distant ever since he lost his girlfriend Eugeneâ¦she was murdered and he was there when it happenedâ¦heâs never been the same ever sinceâ¦at that time he kept rambling on about remembering his past life or somethingâ¦he was adopted when he was small by Derekâs parentsâ¦he used to live with Derek, his adopted brother...but he decided he needed some space and moved into an apartment next to us guysâ¦  I donât have a temper problemâ¦but I can get rather cocky when Iâm in a bad moodâ¦and I really want to show that bar girl a piece of my mindâ¦not to mention get my wallet and cell phone back from herâ¦  The girlâs annoyed expression soon calmed down to a frown crease on her foreheadâ¦I figured that she new Tonti was right and now she was regretting what she had said rather rudelyâ¦  This time it was my turn to have a go at herâ¦but I wasnât going to be nice or polite to her like Tonti wasâ¦this time it was going to get messyâ¦  I stood up from my seat and confronted her, putting on my meanest face everâ¦I had practiced my âmeanâ face in the mirror beforeâ¦I new what I looked like to other people when I had the expression on my faceâ¦my forehead was creased and my eyebrows arched inwardâ¦  Once I had showed Rainer my âmeanâ face asking what he thoughtâ¦ever since Eugeneâ¦he had developed the most coldest and cruelest expressions you could imagine...the feedback I got from him wasnât very nice thoughâ¦his exact words wereâ¦ âYou look constipated like your dying to go to the toiletâ¦now go awayââ¦  With that he walked away leaving the rest of the guys laughing their heads off and clutching their chests trying to suppress their laughterâ¦I wasnât very happy obviouslyâ¦but I knew better then to mess with Rainerâ¦he was deadly when in a bad moodâ¦but he was scary almost all of the timeâ¦none of us guys messed with himâ¦we knew better than thatâ¦  Snapping back to realityâ¦in front of me was a blank expression coming from the girlâ¦    CHAPTER 5  [Benâs P.O.V.] âWHAT?!â she soon snapped at me noticing my unwelcoming facial expressionâ¦  I had to admitâ¦when she was annoyed or angryâ¦she looked hotâ¦but I was never going to tell her thatâ¦I wouldnât give her the satisfactionâ¦  âDonât âwhatâ me girly...give me back my cell phone and wallet!!!â I yelled back at her annoyed at the disrespect she was showingâ¦  Not to mention if any hot girls were watching right nowâ¦they would lose interest in me because I was shouting at a girlâ¦which wasnât manly or gentlemen like at allâ¦but who knowsâ¦I might catch the attention of some girls tooâ¦some chicks like to see a man being dominantâ¦I smirked to myself thinking of the up side of this little shouting contestâ¦  The bar girls face became as white as a ghostâ¦I guess she knew I had got her thereâ¦gathering up her senses she spoke againâ¦  âI donât know what youâre talking aboutâ¦leave me alone!!!â she said motioning that she was leaving the sceneâ¦  âDonât think you can get away so easily you lesbian!!!â¦not this timeâ¦Iâm not as stupid as you thinkâ¦you know EXACTLY what Iâm talking about!!!...Come back here...and give me back my stuff you thief!!!â I yelled at her retreating figureâ¦  She stopped moving and turned aroundâ¦by now the whole bar had gone silent and everyone was listening in on our conversationâ¦our voices were louder then the DJ musicâ¦all eyes were on the girl nowâ¦I guess she didnât like the spotlightâ¦I smirked to myself knowing that I had the upper hand this timeâ¦  âHOW DARE YOU CALL ME A LESBIANâ¦HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOU SICK PERVERTâ¦LEAVE ME ALONE!!!â she yelled back in aggravationâ¦  I donât believe this girlâ¦she knows exactly what Iâm talking about and she still denies itâ¦how stupidâ¦Jeezâ¦what an idiotâ¦itâs a shame that sheâs hot thoughâ¦  I was about to yell back at her when the boss came across hoping to break up the brawl that we were havingâ¦I guess he had noticed that the whole bar had gotten silent and all eyes were on his bar girl and customerâ¦who was obviously meâ¦  âAlrightâ¦calm down pleaseâ¦what seems to be the problemâ¦?â the man saidâ¦making eye contact with the bar girl more then meâ¦  It was clear that he addressing me thoughâ¦  âTell that lesbian of a bar girl give me back my thingsâ¦she stole them the other dayâ¦!!!â I ordered himâ¦obviously unhappyâ¦  The boss nodded to meâ¦signaling me to wait a few moments while he discussed the situation with the lesbian girlâ¦  After a few moments of small mumbles and whispersâ¦the girl carried a smirk on her faceâ¦what was going on?...  I looked at the boss of Crystal Bar demanding an explanation from himâ¦  âMy employee tells me that she has never met you beforeâ¦and that you tried to assault her a few moments agoâ¦and your story is a way to cover up your harassingâ¦â the Boss informed meâ¦  By now I was fuming with rageâ¦what the hell?!!...assault her?!!...Iâm not that stupidâ¦Jeezâ¦who does this guy think he isâ¦and who does she think she is?!...no wonder she had such a smug look on her faceâ¦URghâ¦damn that girl  âBULLSHIT!!!...sheâs making shit up!!!...if she doesnât return my things Iâll sue your bar for all itâs worth!!!â I said in a threatening voiceâ¦all the other guys joined in and supported me saying that the girl was making things upâ¦  Of course I donât have a lawyerâ¦but itâs not like the guy knows that I donâtâ¦besidesâ¦he wouldnât jeopardize his business reputation would he?...I smirked secretly to myself knowing that I would get what I wantâ¦  The bossâs forehead creased in stress and he frowned desperately trying to find a solutionâ¦after a whileâ¦he let out a sigh of defeatâ¦  âAlrightâ¦alrightâ¦but my employee says she didnât take anything of yoursâ¦what do you propose I do?â he asked me trying to negotiateâ¦  This time it was my turn to put a smug look on my faceâ¦I knew exactly what I wanted and she couldnât stop me nowâ¦no one couldâ¦  I scratched my chin which was forming new stubsâ¦I smirked to myself...knowing that everyoneâs attention was on me...and the fate of the girl was in my handsâ¦even the bar girl remained silent waiting for me to decide her fateâ¦she knew she had lostâ¦and I knew it tooâ¦this was too much funâ¦  As the anticipated waiting continuedâ¦I decided to break the tensionâ¦  âFire herâ I said flatlyâ¦with an evil look on my faceâ¦  He turned around to face the girlâ¦obviously delivering the rejectionâ¦the girls face fumed with hatred and annoyance towards meâ¦with her cold eyes she looked at the bosses frown and creased forehead.  âFINE!!!...I quit anyway!!!!ââ¦with that she stormed out and grabbed her thingsâ¦  After a while...everything died down and people began to dance againâ¦I was rightâ¦I had caught the attention of more girls than I had imaginedâ¦they must of automatically assumed that I was rich and powerful...if I could sue the bar for all itâs moneyâ¦I was loving the attention and devoured every single bit of affection or lustful stare given my wayâ¦  This was too good to be trueâ¦I was surrounded by so many hot girlsâ¦and then came the saying in my head againâ¦one that I had always told myselfâ¦  âIâ¦Benjamin Uyâ¦am literally a chick magnetâ¦â    CHAPTER 6  [Nicky's P.O.V.]  can't believe that prick!!! Who the hell does he think he is?!   This just isn't my dayâ¦getting fired because of that a*shole!!!...  He just made me so madâ¦if I ever see him againâ¦I swear he'll get a piece of my mindâ¦and I'll make sure it doesn't end pretty...  I grinded my teeth together in rage and formed fists with my handsâ¦bystanders stared at me like I was a psychoâ¦I didn't blame them though-picture thisâ¦I'm walking in God knows how high, platforms with an extremely tight and short mini skirt with a tight, revealing red tube top to matchâ¦  A guy hooted at me and whistledâ¦my eyes fired up with rage and I shot him a cold, evil glareâ¦his face went deathly white and he backed away from me not wishing to get involvedâ¦  I scowled at him menacingly and stormed off in an extremely pissed off moodâ¦that loser at the bar was going to payâ¦I don't know when, but I was going to make sure he was going to payâ¦now how was I going to pay the rent that I owed with no jobâ¦  I stopped in my tracksâ¦I'm not going to put up with thisâ¦why should he get away with ruining my lifeâ¦he was going to payâ¦all I am is all talk and no actionâ¦I should make him pay shouldn't I?...I smirked to myself wondering what evil plan I would come up withâ¦  'Nice legs baby!' a guy hollered at meâ¦while whistlingâ¦  I snapped out of my thoughts and glared at the guy with cold, glassy eyes in a threatening way hinting him to back away if he knew what was good for himâ¦  'Reow!!!...Feistyâ¦I like that in a girl!' the prick said in a seductive tone trying to impersonate a catâ¦  I was beginning to lose my temper with himâ¦he picked the wrong day to mess with me... 'How much you charging?' he said in a dirty toneâ¦  By now I was fuming with aggravation â¦my eyes were fired up with annoyance and angerâ¦what the hellâ¦he thought I was a whore that A**hole!!!...  'Dare say that againâ¦?' I said in a cold, raspy whisperâ¦motioning towards him taking small stepsâ¦  'I said how mu-' He attempted to repeat himself but I couldn't take it anymoreâ¦  This loser was really pissing me off and I had given him all the possible hints to tell him to back offâ¦what a pigâ¦  I backed away from him escaping from the body heat he was giving off and I drew my arm back and punched him in the face as hard as I couldâ¦.  'I'm not a whore so why don't you just mind your own f*cking business!!!!!!' I yelled back at him in rageâ¦  Everyone on the street was staring at me now in utter shock and silenceâ¦it was completely silent besides the cries of pain from the loser I had punchedâ¦  I glared at each and everyone's face with disgustâ¦people only new to assumeâ¦just because I was wearing this kind of outfit people thought I was a whoreâ¦did I look like a whore? Was I walking like a whore? Did it look like I was practically throwing myself at everyone who was passing by?  My whole body filled up with rage and hatred for the whole worldâ¦it felt like it had turned its back on me that I was the only sane one in this stupid societyâ¦why did this have to happen to me?  'What are all of you looking at?! Haven't you seen a girl hit a guy before?!! Mind your own F*cking business if you don't want to end up like this loser!!!' I screamed at the top of my lungs shooting an evil glare around me to the people who had formed a circle around me at a distanceâ¦  They remained to have blank faces but soon shuffled around and quickly dispersed and scattered back to their own businessâ¦  I huffed and puffed trying to catch my breath backâ¦while my eyes remained wide on guard for any sudden movementsâ¦After I had regained my senses I decided to go back to the bar and vent out my anger on the loserâ¦as well as collect my last pay check from Crystal Barâ¦  My platforms clinked on the cold concrete floor as I stomped off in rageâ¦when I reached the bar it was 3:00am alreadyâ¦it was amazing how time passed by so quicklyâ¦but that wasn't important to me right nowâ¦  Just as I thoughtâ¦the bar was still lively with the loud DJ music on and the heavy smell of liquor wafting in the airâ¦when I entered nobody seemed to notice me which was good because I was in one of my fits and if anyone shot me a weird stare or look I would literally vent my anger on themâ¦which wouldn't be good because I was intending to let it all out on that prick who got me firedâ¦I think his name was Benjamin Uy or somethingâ¦his driver's license photo wasn't very attractiveâ¦he had a pot-head hair cutâ¦I mean, what kind of a girl would find a pot-head hair cut appealing to her tasteâ¦sheeshâ¦  I trudged to the bar and asked for the managerâ¦his name was Brian Jooâ¦he was a pretty decent guyâ¦really hotâ¦I guess he attracted all the female customersâ¦but I was never interested in himâ¦though he might seem like a down to earth guyâ¦how could he be if he owned such a bar which seemed to focus on the bar girls wearing such outfitsâ¦  Brian and I were on good termsâ¦but he had once told me that his business came firstâ¦and he didn't develop friendships with his employeesâ¦I had nodded my head in reply not wishing to question his motivesâ¦although I never admitted it I considered him as my only friendâ¦and now that I was fired by himâ¦my only friend at thatâ¦you can obviously see why I'm in such an aggravated state of mind right nowâ¦  I understand why Brian fired me thoughâ¦like he saidâ¦'business comes first'â¦  'Hey Nickyâ¦sorry about beforeâ¦you understand why I did it though right?' Brian's warm voice seeped into my skin and I began to soften upâ¦  'Yeahâ¦I understandâ¦' I said softly turning to the side not wishing to look him in the eyesâ¦somehow Brian always seemed to calm me down and make me feel betterâ¦it was like a special bond I shared with him that was never expressed through wordsâ¦  I took a deep breath in and inhaled the thick smell of liquor before speaking againâ¦  'Lookâ¦I'm sorry about beforeâ¦I didn't mean to cause a scene or anythingâ¦I just came for my last pay check and I'll get out of your wayâ¦' I said glancing at him and then at the floorâ¦  I could feel Brian's eyes filled with pity and sorrow on meâ¦after a few minutes he disappeared to the backâ¦  I remained still and stared at my feetâ¦I didn't want to face himâ¦I wanted to get away from him as soon as possibleâ¦no one had ever seen me cry before and I didn't want him toâ¦  I had shut everybody out of my lifeâ¦and that was how I wanted to keep itâ¦I didn't want to love anyoneâ¦trust anyoneâ¦or open up to anyoneâ¦this was just the way I wasâ¦I guess I pushed everyone awayâ¦  From time to time I would wonderâ¦is that why I'm not loved?...is this why I don't have any friends?...I never really knew whyâ¦and while I was growing up at the orphanage the nuns would try to encourage me to join in with the other kidsâ¦but I never wanted toâ¦I didn't think I belongedâ¦that they would accept me for who I wasâ¦that I'd be criticized and ridiculed just for beingâ¦.just for beingâ¦being meâ¦.  Just like my parents didn't want meâ¦didn't accept meâ¦they didn't think I belongedâ¦I meanâ¦isn't that the reason why they left meâ¦gave me up for adoption that is?...  Brian soon came back with a small white envelopeâ¦he handed it to meâ¦and I extended my hand for him to place it inâ¦  I lowered my head in shame and disgust with myselfâ¦ 'Thanksâ¦bye Brianâ¦' I said in a soft muffled whisper while turning to leaveâ¦  Slowly I walked out of the bar and squinted back the tears that were on the verge of falling from my eyesâ¦a tear escaped my eye and fell on the floor with a plop on the floorâ¦  'Nickyâ¦' Brian's voice came back to my headâ¦  I had never felt so down in my lifeâ¦I raised my head and took a deep breathâ¦before I turned around I wiped my tears with my free handâ¦after taking a few sniffs I turned around ready to face Brianâ¦  'Yeahâ¦' I said plastering a happy face onâ¦  'I'llâ¦I'll need the outfit backâ¦' He said in a soft voiceâ¦  My heart sankâ¦and I remembered I was still wearing the slutty costume, not to mention make upâ¦  I nodded my head in reply and walked back to the change rooms with my shoulders slumpedâ¦Brian new I took the job because money was a problem for meâ¦I guess he felt sorry for meâ¦but there was nothing he could do nowâ¦his reputation would be at stake if he took me backâ¦I had to learn to understand this and live with itâ¦  As I disappeared in the shadows to the doorâ¦the sensation of feeling Brian's eyes on my back died down and I relaxed a bit moreâ¦  After I changed back to my T-shirt and jeans, washed my face getting rid of the make up and brushed my hairâ¦I looked pretty okayâ¦it didn't look like I had been crying which was a good thingâ¦and the only thing on my mind now was getting back at that Benjamin guyâ¦  I walked out of the changing room after hanging up my outfitâ¦well it wouldn't be my outfit anymore I guessâ¦  With a determined face I confronted the outside bar againâ¦  'The outfits on the rackâ¦' I told Brian while I searched for Ben and his bimbo friendsâ¦  'It's been fun working with you and I'm going to miss youâ¦take care aiite?' Brian said nodding his headâ¦  I seemed to have cut him off with my head bobbing up and down busily searching for Benâ¦  My concentration was broken when a hand waved in my faceâ¦my expression soon changed to an annoyed oneâ¦  'What?!' I snapped at the person not bothering to see who it wasâ¦  'Ummâ¦are you okay Nickyâ¦?' Brian's voice sounded in my ears againâ¦  My expression soon turned soft as I turned to face Brian with a sorry face for snapping at himâ¦  'Ohâ¦uhâ¦I'm alrightâ¦' I replied not really paying attentionâ¦  My expression soon turned to a satisfied one when I spotted the bimbo crew dancing on the dance floorâ¦  I began to make my way towards Ben who was really sweating it out on the floorâ¦I had to admit he had pretty good moves for a complete idiotâ¦I smirked to myself knowing I was going to catch him in complete surpriseâ¦  I was a couple metres within totally bashing it out with him until a warm hand held me back on the shoulderâ¦  I turned around to face the person who had interfered with my plansâ¦with an annoyed expression Brian was my interfererâ¦  'Don't do this now Nickyâ¦I know you want revengeâ¦but not hereâ¦' Brian said giving me a contempt sighâ¦  He seemed to have caught up with my evil planâ¦I gave him a *don't-mess-with-me* look telling him to back offâ¦  'Nickyâ¦don't give me that lookâ¦you know perfectly how it's going to endâ¦I know he seems like a totally insensitive prick and your really ticked off with himâ¦but not here Nickyâ¦now isn't the best timeâ¦' Brian said understandingly trying to negotiate and reason with meâ¦  My face soon softened under his stare and I gave out a defeated groanâ¦  'Fine fineâ¦I won't nowâ¦but soonâ¦believe me soonâ¦' I said informing Brian that he had managed to cool me down for a whileâ¦but it wasn't going to lastâ¦not for long that isâ¦  With that I walked out of the barâ¦still determined to show that loser who he was messing withâ¦    CHAPTER 7  [Benâs P.O.V. I laughed and danced through the whole nightâ¦The guys and I had split up, I had no idea where they were by nowâ¦I didnât really care though  I walked out of the bar with Amy (a girl I had met in the bar) in my arm and a beer bottle in the other, we walked in the cold night towards my car, she lightly smacked me on my chest and I chuckled light heartedly at her attempt to hurt me.  As we neared the car her soft giggles died down and her face went blankâ¦noticing her change I glanced towards my car and the blood instantly drained from my faceâ¦  It was the feisty girl who tried to pick a fight with me in the bar, she probably wanted revengeâ¦I secretly smirked to myself gathering my sense back, knowing she couldnât do anything to meâ¦  Her expression was blank and dullâ¦I couldnât seen to find any signs of anger or annoyance in themâ¦she seemed like a zombieâ¦Amy twitched and wriggled under my arm, I could tell she was uncomfortable under the feisty girlâs stareâ¦I had to admit, I was rather intimidated and felt uneasy as well.  I plastered a brave expression on my face and gave Amy a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder and a flash of my stunning smile, she smiled uneasily and looked towards the girl againâ¦  We began to saunter towards my car, Amyâs heels clicked on the concrete floor steadily as we neared the girl, while we walked she never took her dull, glassy eyes off of meâ¦although I loved the feeling of girls checking me outâ¦somehow I didnât get the impression that was what she was doingâ¦  Nervously I looked around pretending not to notice her, I couldnât shake her stare off, or the uneasiness that lingered in the airâ¦Amy fidgeted around awkwardly not liking her stare eitherâ¦  The feisty girl was leaning on my car door, she seemed laid back but as cold as stoneâ¦it was a frightful feelingâ¦  When we were a metre away from each other I stopped and stood there with an unwelcoming expression on my face, she continued to stare at me with glassy, cold eyesâ¦  What was this girlâs problem? I wondered to myselfâ¦Is she always like this?...sheeSh..She needs to get a life  We stood there in complete silence, to any stranger we would have seemed like we were having a staring contestâ¦I looked at her menacingly and she shot me an icy cold glare, if this WAS a staring contest I was getting the feeling that she was winningâ¦  The silence was awkward and eerie, I didnât like the surroundings eitherâ¦I mean, I donât mean to sound like a sissy girl butâ¦there was no one around and it was past midnight alreadyâ¦the only people in sight were Amy and the other girlâ¦  Luckily I was half drunk so I wasnât really in tune...although I knew perfectly what was going onâ¦I regretted not drinking more alcoholâ¦it would have made me feel better and not so high strungâ¦  âWhat do you want?â I asked her, deciding to break the deathly silenceâ¦  She ignored my question and continued to glare at meâ¦boy, this girl had serious issues to deal withâ¦not only was she a lesbian she was also a weirdoâ¦coming to the conclusion, I settled for that she was a âBenjamin Uy Fanaticâ  Secretly I smirked to myself knowing there were probably a lot more girls like her around... hopefully nicer though...I sighed to myself feeling contempt that one day they would probably get together and form a âBenjamin Uy Lovers Clubâ¦ BULCââ¦  ***Benâs Dreamy Thoughts***  âAaAaHHHHHHhHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!â screamed my fan club  I smirked to myself loving the attentionâ¦this was WAY to cool to be trueâ¦  âOMG..I LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!! MARRY ME!!!â  âNO..MARRY ME!!!...I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT I WOULD DIE FOR YOU!!!!!!!â  âBENJAMIN UY!!! YOUâRE MY HERO!!!â  âAAHhHHHhhH!!!...HE WINKED AT ME!!! DID YOU SEE THAT?!â  Screams of joy filled my earsâ¦it was like heavenâ¦I strutted my stuff and flashed my stunning smile to all the surrounding girls and even did a little pose..the crowd went wild and a couple of my fans faintedâ¦  I winked at them all and even saw a large banner hoisted up in the air readingâ¦ âBENJAMIN UYâ¦OUR LEGENDâ¦â  Again..my motto rang in my mind again...  'I,Benjamin Uy am literally a chick magnet...'  ***End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts***  âLeave usâ¦âa cold raspy whisper sounded in my earâ¦waking me up from my pleasant thoughtsâ¦  I soon found myself back in realityâ¦as the cold dry air blew in my face I noticed Amy was tremblingâ¦I gathered my senses and picked the pieces togetherâ¦ âLeave usâ¦â the voice rang in my head and I assumed that the creepy girl had told Amy to leaveâ¦  She looked at me hesitantly looking for an answerâ¦I decided to let her go, although I was extremely pissed off that I wouldnât be able to have fun tonight I let her goâ¦her facial expression said it allâ¦she didnât want to stay with me at all, especially if the weirdo was aroundâ¦by that Iâm referring to the feisty bar girl...or should I say ex-bar girlâ¦  I tilted my head to a side as I watched Amyâs retreating figureâ¦she walked briskly away while her heels clicked constantly on the cold floorâ¦her hair blew in the cool breezeâ¦The faint sound of her heels died down eventually and I realized how insecure I felt right nowâ¦this girl could be dangerousâ¦  The obvious dangers dawned on me and it didnât feel so good to be near her right nowâ¦especially after the scene at the barâ¦she must have been full-on pissed off at meâ¦although I looked buff and manlyâ¦this girl seemed weirdâ¦and I had a bad feeling about herâ¦     CHAPTER 8  [Benâs P.O.V.] So there I was... all alone with the crazy stalkerâ¦and trust meâ¦it wasnât a nice feelingâ¦  For some reason I felt like one of those spinefex balls would blow past like how they do in corny, old cowboy moviesâ¦  UrgH! What are you talking about Benjamin Uy?!...Your thinking like an idiot nowâ¦you have a serious situation hereâ¦this is your first encounter with a crazed BULC girl!!! Think of a plan you sexy thing!  I wanted to slap myself on the face for being so stupidâ¦you might think Iâd slap myself because I got the girl fired and now she was mega pissed offâ¦butâ¦noâ¦I wouldnât slap myself for thatâ¦neverâ¦it was her fault anyway, I have no feelings of guilt at all towards herâ¦besides, sheâs not worth ruining my face forâ¦  Well as I was sayingâ¦Iâd slap myself for not thinking of an emergency route just incase I encounter fansâ¦I mean, if itâs one fan this time then what about next timeâ¦2? 14? 20?!â¦  Urgh! Benjamin Uy why do you have to be so slow sometimes I thought I had everything coveredâ¦the looks, the fashion statementâ¦the charmâ¦but I forgot the escape route just incase I encounter a Benjamin crazed fan...  âWhat do you want?â I spat.  My voice was full of menace and arroganceâ¦I didnât mean to sound that wayâ¦I guess I was panickingâ¦  Then I thought to myselfâ¦if this was one of my crazed fans then I would have to make a good impressionâ¦she could tell my other fans that I was rude and not all thatâ¦o.0â¦I guess thatâs how it has to go when youâre the sexiest man aliveâ¦*sigh*  âRevengeâ she muttered  âUh-hUhâ¦and how are you going to do that?...youâre not like any fan Iâve seen beforeâ¦instead of revenge I thought you would be worshipping the ground that I walked on, and besides me getting you firedâ¦if I was you, Iâd be thankful that I took notice in youâ¦â I replied back nonchalantlyâ¦while sneeringâ¦  I was beginning to feel at ease and I loosened my muscles while crossing my arms in a pose I had practiced many times in the mirror beforeâ¦I called it my âcool poseâ  Before she could open her mouth to say something I cut her off and started againâ¦this time letting it all outâ¦  âAnd Iâve never seen a fan stoop so lowâ¦honestly, if you wanted something that I possessed why not go to eBay auction?...no need to stealâ¦you donât even act like a fanâ¦the only thing that makes you my fan is that youâve probably been fantasizing about me and stalking me for god knows how longâ¦â I snickered to myself knowing I had got her thereâ¦  Any second now she was going to let it all outâ¦and show me pictures she had taken of me going to my house, going to the shopsâ¦practically anywhere you couldâ¦imagineâ¦maybe even an old Mc Donaldâs foam cup that I had drunken fromâ¦who knows what extremes my fans would go toâ¦  I turned my head to face her because I had been leaning on my car the whole timeâ¦  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  âAwWw...SH*T!!!â I cried out in painâ¦  Did that just happen?!...I thought to myselfâ¦did she just punch me? But I didnât have to answer that, the pain near my eye was enoughâ¦and sheesh...arenât girls meant to slapâ¦not punchâ¦what a tomboy   When I had gathered back my senses, I straightened my figure and stared at her while snarlingâ¦she was really pissing me offâ¦what was with this girl anyway?!  âWhat the Heck was that for?!â I spat out.  Now it was her time to sneer at meâ¦daMmitâ¦I covered my hurt eye hoping I wouldnât have a black eye later on...but the chances were pretty highâ¦this girl could do some serious damage!...she had a lot of strength for a girlâ¦  âWas that your revenge?!â I scowled at her.   She had the biggest smirk on her faceâ¦that pissed me of even moreâ¦If she wasnât a girl I wouldâve hit herâ¦but then againâ¦she could have been a guy cause she had a lot of strengthâ¦and she acted like a guy toâ¦not to mention I thought she was a lesbian, so she couldâve been straight, just that she was a drag queenâ¦  I thought to myself for a moment with a blank expression plastered on my faceâ¦then I inspected her smirking face...she had large hazel eyes, a petite nose and small cherry lipsâ¦all her features seemed to scream out âperfectionâ and âfemininityââ¦  I shook my head vigorously coming to the conclusion that she wasnât a drag queen because she had the figure of a girl tooâ¦*sigh*â¦I settled with the conclusion that she was a tomboyâ¦and again, a âlesbianââ¦obviously because she had punched meâ¦and if my other fans were here...theyâd want to get a piece of herâ¦  I could picture them right nowâ¦  *Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  ***[Rewind]***  *** [Play] ***  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  âAwWw...SH*T!!!â I cried out in painâ¦  *screams* âBenâ¦are you okay?!â   Iâd soon be bombarded with my fansâ¦  âYouâre beautiful face, Oppaâ¦are you okayâ¦â another fan would be close to tears  Others looked like they had been punchedâ¦thatâs how much my fans loved meâ¦*sigh*â¦they felt my pain so much that it hurt themâ¦  A couple of my other fans fainted from the shockâ¦poor girls...I guess it was too much for themâ¦  All of a sudden my fans got upâ¦one by oneâ¦leaving a few of them still comforting me and smothering me with affectionâ¦  âYouâll pay for that you B*tch!â one of them would say  âYeaHâ¦weâre going to teach you not to mess with Benâ¦.who the heck do you think you are anywayâ¦to ruin his sexy faceâ¦youâre going down!!!â another determined fan would yell out  The rest of them chorused in with a â¦ âyEah!â  All of a sudden they were all screaming and charging towards the weirdo fanâ¦*sigh*â¦where would I be without my fan club...  *End of Benâs Dreamy Thoughts*  I was taken back to reality when the ex-bar girl, ex-lesbian and ex-drag queen spokeâ¦wow she was a lot of âexâsâ  âNoâ¦that was just for making up a lot of sh*tâ she snarled in a matter-a-fact tone which pissed me off even moreâ¦  Urgh! I canât stand her!  âGet in the carâ she said, her voice seemed to be calming downâ¦she seemed more feminine nowâ¦  I did as she said thinking that she was going to let me go nowâ¦*phew*â¦this was enough for one dayâ¦as soon as I get home Iâm taking a long showerâ¦  I clicked the alarm and got in my carâ¦while I put on my seatbelt the weird girl opened the passenger door right next to the driverâs seatâ¦  What the hell?!...sheâs not getting in with me! Iâm not that crazyâ¦sheâll probably bash me to a pulpâ¦  She got in the carâ¦and I glared at her mouth-open and eyes wideâ¦what the heck did she want now?!     CHAPTER 9  [Benâs P.O.V.] Againâ¦I thought to fast and I thought I was allowed to goâ¦but here I am againâ¦in a car with some psychoâ¦  âNow what is it?!â I scowled at her while frowningâ¦  Again, she wore the same annoying smirk on her faceâ¦I could tell that she had the upper hand alreadyâ¦obviously she wasnât going to leave me alone unless she got what she wantedâ¦*sigh*â¦she was lucky that I wasnât the abusive type of guy if you know what I mean..  âYou got me firedâ she said in an accusing voice  âYou stole from meâ I said mimicking her tone  âIâm going to be homeless now because of youâ she said accusing me in a louder voiceâ¦  I paused for a few moments taking it all inâ¦homeless? Is that why she stole? Is that why sheâs a bar girl?  It dawned on me why she did all those thingsâ¦and how she was so pissed off at meâ¦bar girls earn quite a lot of money nowadaysâ¦and I got her firedâ¦I was beginning to feel sorry for herâ¦*sigh*â¦â¦she probably needed the money...  But I wasnât going to let her know I felt sorry for her...Iâd probably get another black eyeâ¦â¦it was so unfair thoughâ¦because she was a girl I wasnât allowed to hit herâ¦and that pissed me offâ¦  âYou stole my cell phoneâ I accused her in a challenging way while leaning closer to herâ¦  âBecause of you I lost my only friendâ she said again in aggravationâ¦she leaned closer challenging me back  Retreating my head a few centimetersâ¦I thought of a comebackâ¦HmmSâ¦  âYou stole my wallet!â I accused in a loud voiceâ¦  âThere was only 5 bucks in there anyway you cheap prick!â she yelled at me trying to defend her actionsâ¦  I was taken aback by her words but I managed to find a come back pretty easilyâ¦  âI donât like carrying around a lot of money okay?! And 5 bucks is probably a lot more then you have!â I spat back  As soon as I had finished my sentenceâ¦her face softened and I immediately wished that I hadnât said thatâ¦maybe I was too cruel and harshâ¦  Before I could apologize I got anotherâ¦-  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  Whelpsâ¦I guess you know what happened huh? Yups youâre rightâ¦another black eye *sigh* but this time I deserved itâ¦   âARgh!!! F*ck!â I cried out in agony againâ¦  DaMnâ¦this loony wasnât going to get an apology from me...never, not after my 2nd black eyeâ¦  âSo what the heck do you want now?!â I grimaced at herâ¦hoping to change the subjectâ¦  âLike I saidâ¦revengeâ¦âshe sneered at meâ¦  âYeahâ¦Iâm not stupid you knowâ¦you donât have to repeat yourselfâ¦â I retorted.  âWhat do you want then?â I asked her giving up the fight trying to get it over and done with while covering my â2ndâ black eye...  She snickered at meâ¦urgh! I canât stand herâ¦she pisses me off so much...  âIâll be staying with you for a hundred daysâ¦either that or you give me $100,000â¦your choiceâ she said seeming as though she had thought about it for a whileâ¦  My mouth gaped open not wishing I had heard correctlyâ¦  âW-w-what?â I managed to choke out while stutteringâ¦  Her eyes met mine and she stared at me for a few moments before wearing a big grin from ear to earâ¦  âI thought you said you werenât stupidâ she questioned meâ¦  My face had a blank and confused expression onâ¦what was she talking aboutâ¦  âIâm not stupidâ I retorted back in a matter-a-fact tone  âDidnât you say I didnât have to repeat myself because you werenât stupid?â she asked me already knowing the answerâ¦  âYeahâ¦so?â I replied her curious to what she was getting atâ¦  âWell you wanted me to repeat myself just thenâ she said flatly  I paused for a short while taking it all inâ¦she was right...I didâ¦I wanted to strangle her right nowâ¦dammit...She was so annoying and I hated the fact that she was rightâ¦  âaRgH!...whateverâ I retorted, while crossing my arms like a little boy and facing the other way not wishing to look at herâ¦  âWellâ¦whatâs your choice?â she asked me while slouching on my car seatâ¦  âWhat makes you think that Iâm going to do what you say?!â I snapped  âWellâ¦besides the fact that you stripped me from my only friend, got me fired, and soon Iâm going to be homeless all because of youâ¦I also have your personal belongingsâ¦e.g. your cell phone and driverâs licenseâ¦unless you want people to see Benjamin Uy the man with the afroâ¦then I suggest you agree to my conditionsâ she replied with a big grin plastered on her face.  My eyes grew wide with shockâ¦  âThis is blackmail!â I accused her in disgust.  âDonât you think I already know this?â she sneered at me not expecting an answerâ¦  I thought for a while and spoke againâ¦  âYou knowâ¦your offer is âextremely temptingâ but I think turning you in as a thief to the police seems more satisfyingâ I retorted sarcastically.

You started it by trying to blackmail meâ I snarled in disgust while leaning in closeâ¦we were so close that our noses were millimeters away from touchingâ¦  She paused for a while and gazed into my eyesâ¦then she pulled away and leaned on the car door while facing me inside the carâ¦  She grinned at me and all the while never took her eyes off of meâ¦what was this weirdo up to now?...  âWhat?â I asked her demandingly   âOhâ¦itâs nothingâ¦itâs just that I thought you wouldnât want your drivers license to be enlarged and stuck around the city so everybody could see that humungous, embarrassing afro that you hadâ¦and I thought you would want your cell phone backâ¦thatâs allâ¦nothing muchâ¦â she said casuallyâ¦  With that she turned her body around and opened the car door motioning that she was leavingâ¦  I was flabbergasted by her wordsâ¦but as soon as it sank in...I knew my reputation as being the sexiest man alive would be ruined if she wasnât bluffing...I meanâ¦what would happen to BULC?!...  *Benâs Dreamy Thoughts* âWE LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!!â  âMARRY ME BENJAMIN UY!!!â  âYOUâRE MY HERO!!!â *faints*  âBENâ¦I THINK YOUâRE THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE!!!â  My fans surrounded me with banners and presentsâ¦I donât like to boast or anything but a couple of the banners readâ¦  âBENJAMIN UYâ¦GODâS GIFT TO WOMEN!â  âBENJAMIN UYâ¦OUR LEGENDâ  âSEXY=BENJAMIN UYâ  âI LOVE YOU BENâ¦PLEASE BE MINEâ  I chuckled light heartedlyâ¦to them, I was Godâs giftâ¦*sigh*â¦so perfectâ¦  [Next Day]  Flyer papers were stapled and stuck up anywhere you could imagineâ¦ranging from pink, blue, yellow, white, green and redâ¦  ARgh!

"       AJAX by Aaron M. Holm Based on the Comic Strip, 'Sex & Violence,' also by Aaron M. Holm  Finished First Draft - 8-22-03  FADE IN: EXT: Triad City - Evening The scene opens up on a shot of a neo-futuristic city; grand in design and technology, but showing more than a few signs of decay and spoiling. (Kind of a cross between the 'Delta City' Project from RoboCop, and Gotham City.) This is Triad City. The camera pans along the streets of Triad City, until coming upon a large corner building. The camera then sweeps upward along the side of the building until it reaches a massive shining neon-lit sign. The image of a large white bird incased in a circle, and underneath, in all-caps 'CRANE INDUSTRIES.' The camera sweeps past the sign to a large set of plate-glass windows that show into a large, opulent office. A man stands at the window, watching the lights of the city begin to blink on. INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Evening Hargrove Crane, 65, stares out the window of his high-rise office, surveying his empire. He is tired, bitter and impatient with life. He sips slowly from the glass of single malt whisky in his hand. A door opens across the room. A young man enters. CRANE How did the meeting go, Denis? The young man, Denis Crane, 32, his son, walks over to the bar and pours himself a drink. He is very agitated. DENIS Iâm glad you didnât go to the meeting, Dad. It was a nightmareâ¦ An absolute nightmare. Crane stares intently at the cityscape that will no longer be his to survey. DENIS You were right, Dad. It was worse than anyone could have imagined. CRANE How much are we standing to lose? Denis downs the remainder of his drink in one swig. DENIS All of it. The entire company is to be liquidated. Lou Davenport specifically made a point of saying that nothing would please him more than wiping Crane Industries off the map. The arrogant son of a bitch even grinned at me when he said it. Crane lowers his head and sighs deeply. CRANE All that hard work, time and moneyâ¦ Everything that we ever worked and strived for in lifeâ¦ Gone. Denis walks over to his father and puts his hand on his shoulder. CRANE This company was one of the first businesses in Triad City. Hell, it was a business even before there was such a thing as Triad City. Ours is a rich history, and now, thatâs gone. Davenport knows what this company means to the history and heritage of this city. He worked here for 15 years. DENIS Bastards like Davenport donât care about history and tradition. Even when he worked here, it was obvious that he had no loyalty to this company or anything it might have represented to the world, at large. Heâs just another vulture who wants as much profit as he can pick away from us, regardless of the cost to those involved. CRANE And the board of directors went along with this? DENIS Yeahâ¦ Just like you thought they would. Goddamn Judas Iscariots, all of them. Promise them several fat wads of cash and blowjobs from 19-year old cheerleaders, and they would have signed over the goddamn moon, if they could. Crane says nothing. He continues to watch the city. DENIS Traitorous old bastardsâ¦ Iâd like toâ¦ Crane turns around sharply. CRANE Those traitorous old bastards were the ones who kept this company afloat during the times when profits were short and situations were dire. They are decent old men who deserve far more respect than youâre showing them, Denis. Denis makes to say something in retort, but find he cannot. His fatherâs gaze, while tired, is still formidable enough to command unwavering obedience from his son. CRANE But, sometimesâ¦ Even decent, respected old men get senile. They donât know what theyâre doing. Crane sits down at his antique desk. He stares intently at the blotter. CRANE Itâs a goddamn shame that modern business requires its participants to slaughter and devour the ailing of the group, son. He downs the rest of his whisky, and grips the glass tight. He looks up at Denis with a lean and hungry look in his eyes. CRANE But it also requires that sometimes we have to play extremely dirty in order to stay out of the hyenasâ jaws. Denis nods. CRANE Nowâ¦ Letâs figure out how we keep our company out of Davenportâs dirty mouth. INT. Crane Industries Hallway â Night Crane and Denis stride down the plush, refined hallway. CRANE Now, whatever happens, weâre going to need to distance ourselves as much as possible from this. The last thing we need is to get hung by our own ropes, when weâve got so much at stake. DENIS Naturally. CRANE What we need is to find a couple of patsies. Someone we can distance ourselves from entirely, if the shit does indeed hit the fan. DENIS Some junior executives, you mean? Shit-can them, then lay all the blame on them, if everything goes to hell? CRANE Of course. Whatâs two shlubs who will never get anywhere in life compared to the future of this company? We can lay some cockamamie story about how they must have did it all as a way to try to get back into our good graces again. DENIS Itâs brilliant. They turn into a large room dotted with a multitude of buzzing cubicles. DENIS Shall I? Or, would you like to do the honors? CRANE Be my guest, son. INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Evening Two very young men stand side by side in Cranes office. Their names are Troy Losey and David Diederich. They are both in their mid-twenties, dressed in rather cheap suits and both look scared out of their wits. Crane sits behind his desk. Denis stands behind Crane. Both have big, shark-like smiles on their faces. Denis motions towards the chairs in front of Craneâs desk. DENIS Wonât you both care to sit down? Both tentatively move towards the chairs and slowly sit down. Neither of them take their eyes off of Crane and Denis. Crane motions to a box on the corner of his desk. CRANE Cigar? Either of you? Both look at the cigar box as if itâs a coiled rattlesnake. Finally, Losey, speaks. LOSEY Iâ¦ I donât smoke. Crane opens the box. CRANE Well, Iâll have one. He lights the cigar and takes a couple of puffs on it. He watches the smoke rise for a moment, then suddenlyâ¦ CRANE BOO! Diederich and Losey nearly fly out of their seats. Crane and Denis laugh. Diederich and Losey begin to meekly chuckle. DENIS You boys are way too tense. Relax. Weâre not going to bite youâ¦. Well, I wonât. I donât know about my dad, thoughâ¦ Crane makes a growling noise and utters a couple of ridiculous-sounding barks. All four of them laugh at this. CRANE Goodâ¦ Youâre loosening up. Thatâs just what we wanted to seeâ¦ Denis, go fetch these fine young men each a drink. Denis saunters over to the bar and pours a two glasses of scotch. He walks back over and casually hands the glasses to Diederich and Losey who take them, nervously. Denis picks his glass up and raises it in a mild toast. DENIS Chin-Chin. He takes a drink. Both Diederich and Losey make half-assed return raises and drink their whiskey. Losey chokes slightly. DENIS Nowâ¦ Iâll bet you guys are wondering why we called you up here, arenât you? Both nod nervously. DENIS Well, the truth is, weâve seen you two at work, and we think that you both have that special something that we need for a certain secret project. Diederich and Losey look at each other and then both look at their glasses. DENIS This projectâ¦ Itâs very important to the future of Crane Industries, and could very well mean even greater things for the both of you, should it succeed. Now, there are some risks involvedâ¦ Both stare nervously at Denis. Denis laughs. DENIS Donât worry, Fellasâ¦ Thereâs no health risk. Your hair isnât going to fall out and your dicks arenât going to shrivel up. All weâre requiring from you is a little hard work and ingenuity. CRANE Now, we know you boys will want to do your best for Crane Industries, because itâs given you both so much, hasnât it? Both nod emphatically. A little too emphatically. Crane pretends not to notice this. CRANE I can promise you both nothing but the best, if this project succeeds. Money, promotions, houses, cars, pools, womenâ¦ Oh-ho-HO! Women!!! Crane presses a buzzer and speaks into an intercom. CRANE Michelle? Dominique? Would both of you come in here for a moment, please? A side door to the office opens up and two women of astounding beauty walk in. They walk up to Craneâs desk and drape themselves sensuously over it, in clear view of Diederich and Losey. Crane grins wide-eyed at them. CRANE Nice, huh? You like? Diederich and Losey stare glassy-eyed at the two gorgeous women. CRANE Iâll take that as a yes. (To girls) Thank you, Ladies. That will be all. Both women walk back out of the room. DENIS Now, about this projectâ¦ DIEDERICH Yes! Yes! Oh, God, yesâ¦ Losey merely nods his head. CRANE Goodâ¦ Goodâ¦ Thatâs just what I wanted to hear. DENIS We want your total commitment on this, Gentlemen. This task is extremely important and could mean the end of the company, should you fail. He leans in between the two men and pulls their heads towards his. DENIS I want to know if we can count on you. DIEDERICH Y-yes sir. LOSEY Sure. Denis slaps them both on the shoulders. DENIS Great! He resumes his original place behind his father. Both have that shark-like look in their eyes again. DENIS Hereâs what we want you to doâ¦ We want you to kill Lou Davenport, his executive staff and the board of directors for this company. Diederichâs and Loseyâs eyes widen to the size of dinner plates. DIEDERICH Youâ¦ what?! CRANE You heard him. We want them dead. Any way you want to kill them, it makes no difference to us. DENIS Just so long as theyâre all worm food by Friday. Diederich continues to stare bug-eyed at the two of them. Losey just sits there mouthing words that make no sound. Craneâs and Denisâ shark-like visages turn to sympathetic looks of understanding. CRANE Oh, boysâ¦ Boysâ¦ Donât worry. Weâre fully prepared to cover for you on this. Trust usâ¦ You wonât get caught. Diederich and Losey look completely freaked out. Crane focuses on them with that piercing, authoritative gaze, and speaks quietly, but firmly. CRANE Gentlemen, what this all comes down to is that Crane Industries is in grave danger of dying out. Lou Davenport and his lackeys from Liberation, Incorporated are looking to descend up Crane and suck out everything that they can make a profit from, like a goddamn vampire, and then get rid of the rest. No one will be safe from their cuts, and nothing will be spared. Weâll all be out on the street before the end of the week, unlessâ¦ DENIS Unless, you both come to the rescue of the company. The board of directors is meeting with Davenport and his staff on Friday, to finialize the deal. We want you to make sure that nobody comes out of that meeting, and that all paperwork is destroyed. CRANE Youâre backed by the whole of Crane Industries. You wonât even see a single police carâ¦ Inside or out. Weâll provide you with whatever tools or resources you needâ¦ Just so long as you complete the task youâve agreed to. Both of them stare at Crane and Denis like theyâre insane. DENIS A promise is a promise, Gentlemen. You swore a commitment to my father and myself. We expect you to live up to it. Crane puffs on his cigar. CRANE Think of what Michelle and Dominique would think if you disappointed usâ¦ Diederich puts his head down in his hands and mulls this over. Losey downs the rest of his drink, as well as Diederichâs. DIEDERICH All right! Weâll do it! CRANE AND DENIS Wonderful. INT. Crane Industries Hallway â Night Diederich and Losey are walking down the hall. Losey looks like heâs going to vomit. Diederich looks almost as bad. DIEDERICH I canât believe I said yes. LOSEY I canât believe you said yes for me. DIEDERICH Stillâ¦ It canât be that difficult. I mean, lookâ¦ Out of everyone in the entire company, they picked us. They obviously felt like we were the right guys for the job. We can do this.. LOSEY Yeahâ¦ Youâre right. We can do this. DIEDERICH Then, itâs giant fucking paychecks, executive washrooms, and Dominique in my bed every goddamn night. (punches the air) YES! LOSEY Hey, I called 'dibs' on Dominique. DIEDERICH No you didnât. I called 'dibs.' Besides, I specifically saw you checking out Michelle. LOSEY No, I wasnât. DIEDERICH Well, why werenât you? Did you see the ass on that girl? LOSEY Oh, yeahâ¦ INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Evening Crane and Denis are laughing it up. Both have a glass of whiskey and a cigar. Michelle and Domonique are back in the room and draped over each of the men. CRANE Oh, Sonâ¦ That was pricelessâ¦ I wish we could do that every day. DENIS Yeahâ¦ Did you see the look on the one guyâs faceâ¦ (Mimicking Diederich) 'Youâ¦ WHAT?!' Both laugh uproariously. DENIS Mark my wordsâ¦ We play them well enough, and we could blame the Chicago fires, the Holocaust, and the crucifixion on them, too! FADE OUT FADE IN EXT. Coheeâs Parking Lot â Night The camera is brought back up in the parking lot of a Dennyâs-esque family restaurant. The illuminated sign reads 'COHEEâS FAMILY RESTAURANT â AMERICAâS #1 FULLY AUTOMATED EATERY.' Yet, for being #1, there arenât very many cars parked in the lot. Closer inspection of the eatery shows us that Losey and Diederich are seated in a windowed booth. Theyâre eating a late dinner and talking animatedly. LOSEY This is insane, Dave. Weâre never going to pull this off. DIEDERICH What are you so worried about? You heard Crane. Weâve got the entire company at our disposal to deal with it. Quit whining. Weâll be fine. He takes a bite of his omelet. DIEDERICH (mouth full) Besidesâ¦ How hard would it be to kill a room full of people anyway? A little old lady a couple of booths away casts them an odd glance. Loseyâs eyes get about as big as they were in Craneâs office. LOSEY JESUS CHRIST! Would you keep your voice down? DIEDERICH What? Are you worried that guyâs gonna stop us? (points to a shaggy, disheveled cycloptic man in a nearby booth) Or him? (points to a fat, slug-like thing eating a massive, salsa-covered omelette) Or her? (points to the sour-faced old lady gawking at them) He laughs. Losey stares incredulously at him. DIEDERICH Jesus, would you relax? (he leans in and talks softly) Lookâ¦ I picked this place to talk about it for a good reason. For one, itâs one of the safer places in the world to discuss the project without anybody listening. These people? (waves his arms to indicate everyone in the room) These people could give a fuck what weâre talking about. For all they know or care, we could be rehearsing lines from a fucking play. Losey nods. DIEDERICH (continuing) Also, this place is owned by a restaurant franchising company, called Bluebird Eateries. Now, do you know who happens to own Bluebird Eateries? LOSEY Your mother. Diederich rolls his eyes. DIEDERICH What are you, a fourth grader? He smacks Losey in the forehead. DIEDERICH Crane Industries. CRANE FUCKING INDUSTRIES. We couldnât be in a safer place to talk. LOSEY Yeah, butâ¦ DIEDERICH (cutting in) ALSOâ¦ I picked this place, because the place is totally automated. The only living, breathing biological entity that works here is the maintenance technician who comes in, once a month, to make sure everything is in working order. Otherwise, the place is 100 percent run by robots. He motions to a gorgeous redhead in a waitress uniform, smiling brightly and pouring coffee for the slug with the salsa and omelette. DIEDERICH If our waitress over there comes by to fill up our coffee, and weâre screaming at the top of our lungs about putting a hollow-point bullet straight into Joe Blowâs fucking brain, sheâs just smile, ask us if we need anything else and go on to the next table. She wonât snitch to the cops. She wonât tell her buddies in the back. Because behind those pretty green eyes and incredible ass, sheâs just a machine. She doesnât give a fuck about anything, because sheâs nothing more than a goddamn walking coffee decanter. Loseyâs eyes suddenly brighten. If there were a light bulb hovering over his head, it would be flashing on, suddenly. LOSEY Just a machineâ¦ DIEDERICH What? LOSEY Just a machineâ¦ Losey laughsâ¦ Itâs not so much a mirthful laugh, as an 'Iâve just had the idea of the century, and I canât believe it' laugh. DIEDERICH What the hell are you laughing about? LOSEY Iâve just figured it out. DIEDERICH Figured what out? What the fuck are you talking about? LOSEY This. Losey suddenly knocks Diederichâs coffee over. It spills all over the table and splashes onto Diederichâs suit. DIEDERICH Hey! What the fuck areâ¦? LOSEY Shut up and keep quiet. Losey motions to the waitress to come over. LOSEY Oh Miss? Could you come over here for a second? The waitress walks over to their table. She is breathtakingly beautiful; appearing to be in her early twenties, with gorgeous skin, shoulder-length red hair, brilliant green eyes, and an incredible smile. She looks down and smiles warmly at Losey and Diederich. WAITRESS Can I help you, Gentlemen? LOSEY Yeahâ¦ Weâve, uh.. My friend, here, had a bit of an accident with his coffee. She casts a look of pleasant sympathy towards Diederich, who is scowling at Losey. WAITRESS Of course. Let me clean that right up and Iâll get a you a fresh cup, Sir. DIEDERICH (Through gritted teeth) Thanks. She wipes up the mess quickly. LOSEY Oh, Miss? You missed a spot. WAITRESS Oh? Where? LOSEY Back here. He indicates a small puddle, no bigger than a quarter on the far end of the table. The Waitress smiles happily. WAITRESS Yes, Sir. Happy to please. LOSEY Thank you so much. She reaches to the far end of the table to wipe up the coffee spot. As she reaches, Losey reaches around behind her back and presses own on the back of her neck. She makes a whirring noise and slumps down onto the tabletop. Losey quickly glances to Diederich. LOSEY Quick, Dave! Help me get her up and out of here! DIEDERICH What the hell did you justâ¦ LOSEY Shut up and pick her up, for Christâs sake! He stands up and addresses the gawking diners. LOSEY Itâs all right, Folks. Nothing to worry about. Weâre with the company. We heard that this unit was malfunctioning and weâre going to take it in and have it serviced. He grabs one of the arms and helps Diederich quickly drag the waitress out the door. The diners continue to stare blankly at the door. EXT: Triad City Street â Night A car speeds down the busy streets of Triad City. Troy Losey is behind the wheel. Diederich sits next to him, looking just as incredulous as Losey had in the diner. INT: Loseyâs car - Night DIEDERICH What the hell did we just do? LOSEY WE just found the solution to our problems. DIEDERICH What the fuck are you talking about? LOSEY OKâ¦ I got to thinking. Remember that huge fucking research project that Bob Griffin sandbagged us with about 6 months ago? DIEDERICH Yeahâ¦? It was a pain in the ass load of busy-work, as I recallâ¦ LOSEY Exactly. Now, remember how we made sure it got done? DIEDERICH We talked Purinton and Seger into doing it all. LOSEY Right. Now, look at our situation nowâ¦ How is this any different? Diederich stares at him blankly. LOSEY Jesus, Daveâ¦ Do I have to spell it out to you? DIEDERICH Purinton and Seger? Losey smacks him upside the head. LOSEY No! This! (Motions to the backseat) This is our Purinton and Seger! DIEDERICH What, you mean the robot? Are you crazy? LOSEY Not at all! Look, you, yourself, said that it was a machine. A machine does what it is programmed to do. DIEDERICH Yeah? LOSEY So, we program it to kill those people. It does all the work, and we sit back and reap the rewards. Just like Purinton and Seger. Only this time, it wonât cost us a case of whiskey and 200 bucks. Diederich sits back and takes all this inâ¦ DIEDERICH Troy, you are a genius! Losey looks excessively proud of himself. LOSEY Yesâ¦ Yes, I amâ¦ DIEDERICH There is one problem, thoughâ¦ LOSEY Whatâs that? DIEDERICH Who do we know that can do that kind of programming? And what about equipment for that kind of a job? Now, I donât know about you, Troy, but I donât happen to know any arms dealers that can reprogram androids! Losey smiles slyly. LOSEY One step ahead of you, mi amigoâ¦ EXT: Triad City Street â Night The car speeds off into the night. EXT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn Storefront â Night Diederich and Losey park in front of a storefront lit by a large, flickering-neon sign that reads 'POT OF GOLD GUN &amp; PAWN.' There is a large graphic of a black cauldron imprinted with a white dollar sign and overflowing with gold. Losey runs inside. He walks back out, shortly, with a thin, weasily man in his mid-twenties. Heâs dressed in jeans and a wife-beater undershirt, and sports a mop of untidy, bleached-blond hair, a weekâs growth of beard stubble and black sunglasses. His arms are wiry and tattooed. This is Ernie Bishop. He gazes into the back-seat of the car at the deactivated android. He lowers his sunglasses. One of his eyes has no pigmentation. BISHOP Hmmmâ¦ Where the hell did you get a Coheeâs waitress droid, Troy? TROY Iâd rather not say, Ernie. Itâs better off if we kept a lot of these details on the hush, if you know what I mean. Bishop crinkles his nose, pushes his shades back up, turns around, and walks back towards the shop. BISHOP OK, Losey. You and your girlfriend can bring the âbot inside. My sister can look it over for you. Losey and Diederich unload the android from the back seat and carry her inside. INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn sale floor - Night The store is a bit of a hole in the wall. Various odds and ends are littered on shelves and racks of varying sizes. Thereâs a sign on the wall, which reads, 'NO, WE DONâT HAVE ANY DAMN POKEMON CARDS.' Bishop crosses the floor to a set of double doors, marked 'Employees Only.' Diedreich and Losey stumble in, half-carrying, half-dragging the cumbersome waitress android, which lolls around like a corpse. They lug her to the counter and heave her down onto the countertop. DIEDERICH How in the fuck do you know this guy? LOSEY Ehâ¦ I met him in college. DIEDERICH Guys like that actually go to college? LOSEY Yeah. The guyâs a fucking genius at robotics. The problem is heâs such an insufferable asshole that nobody wants to work with him. BISHOP (O/C) I heard that. LOSEY (calling out) Just calling it like I see it, Ernie. BISHOP (O/C) Fuck you. The employees only doors swing open and Bishop walks back out, carrying a large red metal toolbox. Following him is his sister, Rosie, a very attractive woman with long, blonde hair and wearing a pair of red safety goggles atop her magnificent headâ¦ At least, sheâs a woman from the waist up. Her lower half is a mess of wire and metal, attached to a small, bulky tank-like base. She coasts forward to the counter and smiles at Losey and Diederich. ROSIE Good evening, Gentlemen. Ernie tells me you want to retrofit an android. ROSIE Ooh, I seeâ¦ A food service drone. (She smirks) Interesting choice. She rolls the android on its side, and runs her finger along the line of her neck. A small whirring sound is heard and the skin around the neck seems to dissolve to reveal a small rectangle. She gently pushes down on the rectangle, and it pops open like a lid, revealing a unit identification number, a small data drive, and a few flashing lights. ROSIE Hmmmâ¦ Universal Improvement Industries Food Service Drone, unit LY491. Thatâs good. One thing you can say about the U.I.I. units, their bodies are quite adaptable to tinkering around with. She closes the lid and runs her finger down the original path she made to open the panel. The lines disappear and the skin appears to have not had a single mark in it at all. ROSE I love this dura-skin theyâre putting on these things, anymore. The stuff can stop a bullet, feels warm to the touch like real skin and still allows for easy access for repairs and modifications. If you look at the crappy old stuff they used to put on androids, you can seeâ¦ Bishop sighs impatiently and interrupts her. BISHOP (cutting in) If youâre done fawning over Little Miss Clockwork, Rosieâ¦ Weâll get down to business. (to Losey &amp; Diederich) What all are you wanting done on this damn thing? DIEDERICH Guns. Lots of Guns. The kind of stuff that can clear a room out in less than a minute. LOSEY Not to mention the knowledge of how to use them. The last thing we need is her waltzing into the room, armed to the teeth, then not knowing what the hell sheâs supposed to do with all that hardware. BISHOP Sounds like youâve got a serious mean-on for somebody, Losey. LOSEY This? Nahâ¦ This is business. Bishop shrugs and lights a cigarette. BISHOP You do realize that the modifications that youâre wanting made to this android are, for the most part, quite illegal, correct? How do I know that weâre not going to wind up with our assesâ¦ (He casts a glance at Rosie.) Well, MY ass in a sling. I donât know what the hell theyâd put her inâ¦ She smacks him upside the head. BISHOP Anyway, itâd be the shits if we got caught being tied to this, if you get my drift. Do we have anything to be worrying about, Losey? LOSEY Nope. I can guarantee it. Thereâs no paperwork being tied to this. Nothing will lead back to either of you. BISHOP Good. Thatâs real good, Troy. And on the subject payment? DIEDERICH Cash. Name your price. You can practically see the dollar signs light up in Bishopâs eyes. LOSEY The catch is that this is a seriously rushed job, Folks. I mean, really rushed. We need it ready to roll by Friday morning. ROSIE Not a problem. I work fast. LOSEY Great. Weâll be in touch, Ernie. BISHOP Yeah. We will. Losey and Diederich walk out. EXT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn Storefront â Night DIEDERICH I donât trust that oily fucker one iota. LOSEY I donât either. Fortunately, heâs greedy and egotistical. Itâll have a massive fucking price tag on it, but itâll definitely be quality work. Anything less would make him feel like he might look bad. DIEDERICH It better be. A lot more is riding on this shit than his reputation. They get in the car and drive away. INT: Pot of Gold Gun &amp; Pawn sale floor - Night Standing by the caged-in window, Bishop watches them drive away. He then proceeds to dance all the way up to the front counter and plants a huge wet kiss on the androidâs mouth. BISHOP Ooh, you beautiful little cash cow! You are going to make me so much moneyâ¦ Rosie looks concerned. ROSIE Iâm a little worried about this, Ernie. BISHOP About what? Since when were you concerned about the occasional jack-off getting a pill in the head? Weâre getting paid for it not to be our problem. ROSIE Itâs not thatâ¦ Itâs just that reprogramming a cybernetic brain, once its primary operating system has been initialized, is tricky business. Thereâs a self-extracting directive that formulates itself in each droidâs mind, which makes up its personality and dictates who it becomes and what it does. I donât care how skillful you may think you areâ¦ Trying to go in with some fancy new program and change it out seriously fucks up the unitâs mind. And I mean SERIOUSLY. Iâve seen it, first-hand. Thatâs like going into a flesh and blood personâs brain with a screwdriver to try and change their personality... Itâs just not something that can be done quickly or easily. Hell, theyâre STILL trying to perfect the process. No oneâs really been able to pinpoint exactly why this happens. Bishop flashes her an irritated glance. BISHOP And your point isâ¦? ROSIE My point is that a week couldnât be enough time to rewrite the droidâs entire brain. A few months.. Maybe a year, and maybe we might be able to do itâ¦ But five days is not only impossible, itâs insane. BISHOP So we wonât fuck with its brain if we donât have to. Weâll just dump the new directive in and call it good. ROSIE We can do that. Thatâs little more than a simple directive switch. Iâll need the program for that, though. I donât have anything like that on hand. BISHOP Iâll get it. Donât worry. ROSIE There is one small problem, thoughâ¦ BISHOP And that isâ¦? ROSIE Well, it will still be running on its old operating system. Have you ever heard the saying, 'You can take the girl out of the country, but you canât take the country out of the girl?' This is the same principle. Itâs true that U.I.I. droids are easy to modify, and we can arm this waitress droid to the teeth and give her the programming to kill, kill, kill, but thatâs like taking a nanny drone, attaching a jackhammer to it, and putting it to work doing construction. BISHOP But it will work, right? ROSIE Oh, yeah. We can make her into a killer, easy. But sheâll be the nicest, sweetest, most considerate killer you ever laid eyes on. Bishop takes a long drag and then smashed out the cigarette in the already-overflowing ashtray on the counter. BISHOP Then let them deal with that. Weâre just getting paid to make Little Miss Sunshine here into Charlie fuckinâ Manson. Let them deal with whether or not she tries to clean up the mess after she splatters some poor fuckâs brains all over the wall. That isnât our problem, Sis. Rosie shrugs. ROSIE Well, when youâre right, youâre right. BISHOP Of course I am. Now, câmonâ¦ Weâve got work to do. FADE OUT FADE IN: EXT: Triad City Street â Day Losey buys a hot dog from a street corner vendor. He takes a bite from it, and dials a number on a nearby pay phone. Diederich stands nearby, watching. LOSEY (Into phone) Hey, itâs me. Howâs our little girl doing? INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn back room â Day Bishop is on the other end of the line. Heâs seated at a workbench with working on an arm connected to a computer. The monitor reads a series of diagnostic reports off. The fingers of the hand attached to the arm flex and extend. The arm occasionally bends and straightens. BISHOP (Into phone) Doing all right. Sheâs growing up considerably faster and better than even I thought she was going to. LOSEY (from phone) Good. Wonderful. Will she be ready by Friday? BISHOP (Into phone) Well before then. Bishop types a series of keys, and a small hatch opens up in the wrist of the arm. A rectangular box clacks out of the hatch and pops open, to reveal itâs a small pistol. The pistol is caught in the hand and the arm straightens, as if to aim. The trigger is pulled, although nothing happens but a series of clicks. The gun then flings the gun away. It clatters across the room. ROSIE (O/C) Dammit, Ernie, will you watch what youâre doing! Bishop smirks. BISHOP (Into phone) Like now. He types another set of keys, and a knife suddenly flips out from within the housings of the arm, and stops at palm level. The hand closes around the handle of the knife and proceeds to slash and jab with it. BISHOP (Into phone) Weâll have her ready to â¦ The arm swings wild, and knocks a bottle of beer into his lap. BISHOP SHIT! He frantically tries to mop up the mess. BISHOP (hurriedly, into phone) Sheâs ready to go. Iâll wire you with the place to meet and the fee. He hangs it up and resumes mopping up the spilled beer. BISHOP Dammitâ¦ EXT: Triad City Street - Day Losey hangs up the phone. He nudges Diederich and they both walk off. FADE IN: INT: Warehouse - Day Bishop and Rosie both wait in the middle of an empty, expansive warehouse. Thereâs a honk that echos across the expansion. The doors on the far end of the building open automatically, and Loseyâs car drives in. The car pulls up to them and parks. Diederich and Losey get out. Diederich is carrying a large case. Losey looks around the empty warehouse. LOSEY Well? Where is she? BISHOP Letâs see the green, first. Diederich slides the case across the filthy cement floor to Bishop. He picks it up and opens it. The case is bursting to the gills with cash. He shuts the case, and turns toward a delivery truck parked behind them. The truck door opens, and the waitress droid steps out. Instead of her Coheeâs uniform, sheâs wearing a pair of cutoffs, a T-shirt, and scuffed work boots. She saunters over to them and smiles warmly. WAITRESS Hi there! Can I get anyone anything? Coffee? Tea? One of Coheeâs delicious homestyle muffins? DIEDERICH Hold on! Sheâs still in waitress mode! BISHOP Relax, Sugarâ¦ Itâs just the androidâs standard operating system. Donât worry, she gets the job done just fine. LOSEY Whatâs with the outfit? ROSIE Easier access to the armaments. Ajax? Slats in either side of her outer thighs open up, revealing two holsters, bearing a pair of shining pistols. She draws them, and twirls them on her fingers. The slats close up again. LOSEY What did you just call her? BISHOP Ajax. I thought it was appropriate, considering sheâs getting rid of a bunch of stains. Bishop motions towards a set of targets set up on a far wall. Ajax turns and fires repeatedly at the targets. Perfect head shots each time. Then, perfect dead-center chest shots. Then, perfect groin shots. BISHOP Weâve also got her equipped for melee fighting. She runs at a man-shaped punching bag, slung from a rafter. She proceeds to beat the living crap out of it. A well-placed kick causes the chain holding the dummy to snap, and the dummy goes flying. Blades ejects from her wrists and she pounces onto the prone dummy. She slashes the wrists and throat of the dummy. Sand pours out. She jabs both knives into the mid-section of the dummy and slashes upward. Sand erupts from the gash in a tidal wave. BISHOP Sheâs equipped with twin pistols and bayonets, as youâve already seen. She also is capable of street-brawling tactics, as well as several different styles of martial arts. Not to mention knowledge on how to use most conventional weapons, as well as an improvisational program that I wrote personally for her, for some not-so-conventional weapons. He tosses a box of thumbtacks at her. She catches the box and proceeds to hurl the tacks at a nearby wall with such velocity that they embed themselves deep. DIEDERICH Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. ROSIE Sheâs also been equipped with a scanner blocker, which can fool most id scanners and metal detectors. Scanners will register her as completely human, without a single weapon on her. Guard dogs wonât be able to tell the difference, either. LOSEY Excellent work. You both earned every cent. BISHOP Of course. You were expecting a half-assed job from someone as brilliant and talented as me? DIEDERICH Weâll need to stash her someplace until sheâs ready. That way, we arenât seen near her before or after she does the job. BISHOP She can stay here. Just give her the info of where and when, and sheâll take care of the rest. LOSEY Beautiful. Check the pocket of the case. Rosie opens up the case, and produces a disc. She examines it for a moment. ROSIE Thisâll work. LOSEY Great. Weâll take our leave of you three, then. Thanks again, Ernie. You came through like a pro. BISHOP No shit, Sherlock. Now, get out of here. Diederich and Losey get in their car and drive off. Bishop watches them leave, then looks to Rosie. BISHOP Itâs all in there, right? No phone books under a layer of bills? ROSIE Nope. They paid it all. Frankly, Iâm amazed, considering the price you asked for. BISHOP Thatâs because theyâre stupid and desperate. He glances over at Ajax, whoâs building a sandcastle out of the sand from the dummy. BISHOP Sheâs kind of loopyâ¦ Havenât you noticed that? ROSIE I donât know. I think itâs kind of cute, really. Bishop sighs in disgust. BISHOP You would. ROSIE Anyway, itâs nothing to worry about. You get these occasional personality quirks like that when you do a rush job reformatting their programming. Sheâll still get the job done, no problem. BISHOP Whatever. Itâs not like Iâll ever have to deal with her ever again, after tonight. Letâs upload the data they gave us into Little Miss Sunshine and get out of here. Weâve got cars and houses to buy. INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Day Losey and Diederich sit opposite Crane and Denis. They look confident and poisedâ¦ Much different than their last meeting. LOSEY We just wanted to let you both know that the project is a definite go. DIEDERICH We just witnessed a demonstration, this afternoon, and I can tell you right now, that this is going to work perfectly. DENIS Excellent. We canât afford any hitches or mistakes. LOSEY Not to worry. Itâs all been taken care of. CRANE And there will be no ties back to any of us? DIEDERICH Not a one. Guaranteed. CRANE Excellent, boys. I canât wait to see what happens. I almost wish I could be there, but I imagine that would be rather ill-advised, to say the least. All laugh. DENIS One thingâs for sure, I sure wouldnât want to be in Lou Davenportâs shoesâ¦ He drains the rest of his scotch. EXT: Patio - Night Cut to a middle-aged man soaking in a hot tub with two naked beauties. Heâs sporting a bronze tan, slicked-back hair and the look of someone whoâs loaded. He laughs heartily as he puffs on a cigar. This is Lou Davenport. Swanky music plays in the background, as he drinks martinis. One lovely nibbles on his earlobe, and the other kisses his neck. Suddenly, he stops laughing and his face goes slack. The cigar falls from his mouth into the tub. He goes rigid and clutches his chest, then falls face-first into the tub. The girls scream. INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Day Close-Up on newspaper front page, which reads 'Business Mogul Davenport Dies in Hot Tub.' The subhead reads 'Congestive heart failure ruled cause.' Panning out reveals that Crane is reading the paper. Denis looms over his shoulder, also reading the article. CRANE Talk about divine justice. DENIS So,where does the buyout stand, now? CRANE I think we can turn this thing around to your advantage. Liberation will be in disarray now that Davenportâs gone, and we can bully the Board of Directors back into our fold. Unless some act of God happens, weâre going to come out on top. DENIS What about our two patsies? Weâll have to call them off. CRANE I think weâll have to do more than call them offâ¦ Their role in this situation is nothing more than a liability to us, now. This current situation calls for a bit more extreme measures to ensure stability. DENIS Easy enough to take care of. EXT: Triad City Street â Day Losey and Diederich buy hot dogs from a street corner vendor. They get back into Loseyâs car. The engine turns over. The car explodes. INT. Hargrove Craneâs Office â Day DENIS Still, they never actually told us what they were proposing to do. I told them not to tell us, as I figured that it was in our best interests not to know. CRANE Well, that was a prudent move at the time. Though it does pose a problem for use right now. We need to think about what they might have planned. DENIS As clueless as they both were, I seriously doubt that either of them was stupid enough to try and pull it off, themselves. It had to be some sort of outside connectionâ¦ A hired killer, or perhaps, a bomb. CRANE Still, unless we can root out the problem, weâll just have to bulk up security tomorrow, and hope that nothing will happen. INT. Warehouse â Morning Ajax stands motionless in the middle of the warehouse. Dawn is breaking, and the sun is beginning to shine through the filthy windows of the building. The camera rushes up to her until itâs focusing on her closed eyes. They open suddenly, with a pleasant look about them. FADE OUT FADE IN: EXT: Crane Industries - Day We are focused on the entrance of the large, gleaming Crane Industries building, when a large delivery van pulls into the frame, obscuring the camera's view. A car door is heard opening and closing and footsteps on the pavement are then heard, walking towards the back of the van. We hear the back door open and the sound of something being pulled out of the back. Footsteps are heard walking away from the van. The camera pans along the side of the van, to see the back of a shapely woman in a delivery uniform, walking towards the glass doors of the building, carrying a large box. The camera follows her into the building. INT. Office Building Lobby - Day We follow behind the delivery girl, as she walks across the busy lobby. People scurry by, lost in their own world, and would almost collide with her, if she were not already moving with catlike grace; so unusual for someone carrying a large, bulky package as she currently is. She stops in front of a large reception counter, and props the box onto the counter. It's very large and obscures the view of the receptionist behind the counter. The receptionist sighs irritatedly and looks up at the box from her paperwork. She pushes the box aside, and we get a nice big look at the face of Ajax. Her hair is partially-covered by her deliveryman's cap, save a few strands hanging down. She smiles brightly and cheerfully at the receptionist, who scowls back at her. RECEPTIONIST Yes? Can I help you? AJAX Good Morning. I'm from the Crixus Courier Company, and I have a package to deliver to a Mr. Skyler Luntz. The receptionist looks totally uninterested and irritated. The delivery girl continues her bright, sunny smiling. RECEPTIONIST Ah. Well, I'll sign for it. AJAXI'm Sorry. Iâm afraid I can't do that. RECEPTIONIST Excuse me? AJAXYou see, it's Crixus' company policy for me to personally hand the package over to the intended party, and that I am to get his signature, and his signature alone, for said package. This way, the chance of the parcel being lost, stolen, damaged, delivered to the wrong person, or any other factor that might, in any way, cause tarnish to the reputation of Crixus being the world's leader in reliable, expeditious delivery of parcels, packages, documents, and whatever else that needs sending, stays one hundred and fifty percent in the clear. She smiles wide and happily. The receptionist is beginning to get very irritated with her. RECEPTIONIST And it's company policy, here at Crane Industries, as well as any other company in the known universe which has even the remotest sense of intelligence behind it, to not let anyone just waltz into it's offices with a sealed box which could very well hold something threatening. To do so would be both mind-numbingly stupid and hazardous to the well being of our employees. Ajax seems rather amused by this statement. AJAXI can assure you, there's nothing about this package, or myself, that's the least bit harmful to you or anyone else. The receptionist rolls her eyes at this. She REALLY dislikes this girl now. RECEPTIONIST Look, Missâ¦ I've got a lot of work to do right now, a four-star migraine. What I donât have is the patience or mood to be bothered by this crap right now. Just give me the goddamn form, and I'll sign it, and you can get this stupid thing out of here. AJAX(Still smiling brightly and maintaining an extremely pleasant tone of voice, but obviously means business) And I told you, Miss, I'm not at luxury to do so. Were I to just go ahead and allow you to sign for this package and just assume you were going to let Mr. Luntz have it, I would catch all kinds of grief from my superiors. Then, your company might get a series of angry phone calls from Crixus' main office, inquiring as to why our reputation was to be blemished, simply because you have a headache. The receptionist has had it, by this point. RECEPTIONIST Fine... Whatever... (INTO INTERCOM) Wade, could you come over here? A security guard strides over to the receptionist desk. RECEPTIONIST Wade, I need you to escort this woman through the detector, then, if she's clear, escort her up to Mr. Luntz's office? See that she's quick. I don't want her wandering around here any longer than she needs to be. Wade nods dutifully, then motions to Ajax to follow him. She does and cheerfully waves goodbye to the receptionist, who scowls at her. INT. - Security Office Screening Room - day WADE Put the box on the scanner table and then stand in the red circle on that platform over there, please. AJAXI know the procedure. She gently sets the box down on a large metal table, positioned in the middle of the room, then walks up a small set of steps into a large glass tube. She stands in the middle of a red circle, positioned in the middle of the floor of the tube. Wade walks into a small windowed enclosure off to the side and shuts the door behind him. Lights turn on and the sound of machinery starts resounding softly in the room. WADE (VIA INTERCOM) I imagine you go through this sort of thing a lot, working for Crixus and everything. AJAX (VIA INTERCOM) Occasionally. It's usually the big corporations that give you the most hassles about doing the job. The Mom and Pop places aren't nearly so jittery. Though I do understand the necessity of such a process. I mean, no one wants to get blown up or anything, do they? Wade chuckles. He's obviously taken with her. WADE (VIA INTERCOM) No, I don't imagine they do. OK, I'm initiating the scanning process... (BEAT) Now. The room turns a soft shade of blue as two long, jointed metal tubes descend from a large device attached to the ceiling. The ends of the tubes dart around frantically over the boxes as small beams of light trace out patterns of the box's contents. Two similar tubes decent from the top of the glass tube on either side of Ajax. Rather than jointed, these descend straight to the bottom of the tube and emit a lengthwise wall of soft blue light from tube to the other INT. - Security Screening Control Room - day Wade examines the control panels and monitor screens. One large screen monitors the contents of the box on the table. The other monitors Ajax in the tube. WADE (INTO THE INTERCOM) I always feel kinda guilty doing this. I feel like I'm snooping at people's private stuff. AJAX (VIA INTERCOM) Well, I don't image that I could be helped, could it? I mean, security's security. WADE (INTO THE INTERCOM) True enough. A light on the panel flashes green. INT. - Security Office Screening Room - day WADE (VIA INTERCOM) OK, everything checks out. I'm shutting down the scanner now. The room resounds with a powering-down noise. The tubes retract into their housings, and the lights return to their usual soft white. Wade steps out of the control room and smiles. WADE OK, where are you needing to go? INT. - Elevator - day Wade and Ajax are in an otherwise empty elevator. She's looking at the control panel; her usual sunny smile on her face. Wade stand behind her, obviously checking out her ass. WADE Do you have a lot of deliveries to make today? AJAXNope. Just this one. WADE Really? Given the time, that sounds like it leaves you with a fairly open schedule for the rest of the day. AJAXKindaâ¦ WADE Câmonâ¦ What? DELIVERY GIRL Ohâ¦ Stuffâ¦Wade chuckles. WADE Which isâ¦? She turns her head to look at him. Her eyes twinkle at his questioning. She smiles. AJAXWell, if you must knowâ¦ I'm going to see if there's anything else I'm supposed to be doing, today. Then, if my schedule's totally clear, then I'm going dancing. She goes back to watching the numbers on the control panel screen go flashing by. 9, 10, 11, 12... WADE Dancing, eh? Do you go out often? Ajax continues to study the control panel but makes a soft grunt of acknowledgement. WADE I've been out to the clubs a time or two in the last couple of weeks, but I don't think that I've ever seen you at any of them before. Is there a specific one you go to? She says nothing. She continues to gaze at the control panel screen. 14, 15, 16... She suddenly presses the 'STOP' button on the panel at 17. DELIVERY GIRL This is my stop. WADE No it's not. Mr. Luntz works on the Twenty-seventh floor. This is only the 17th. Ajax smiles coyly at Wade. AJAXI know. Suddenly, with blinding speed, Ajax sends an elbow to Wade's jaw. The tall guard goes flying backwards into the wall of the elevator with such force that his head puts a colossal dent in the wall of the car. He slumps to the floor of the car. A small stream of blood oozes down the side of his head. Ajax then looks up towards the corner of the elevator car. INT. â Main Security Office â day An overweight security guard sits in front of a sea of security cam monitors. Heâs not paying attention to a single one of them, however, as his attention is totally focused on a porno magazine. One of the monitors shows the elevator that holds Wade and Ajax. The camera zooms toward and focuses tight on it.POV SHOT - ELEVATOR SECURITY CAMERA Ajax is seen in the green view of a security camera. She smiles brightly. She then puts her hand over the lens. A pop is heard, then snow fills the screen. INT. - Elevator - day Cutting back to inside the elevator reveals that Ajax has crushed the security cam with one bare hand. She removes her hand from the camera. Ajax proceeds to open the box. Inside is a pressed business suit, a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and a wig of long, straight and blonde hair. At the bottom of the box is a small, black briefcase. She opens and examines the briefcase. Inside, in foam housings are two silver pistols. Each has the embossed words 'Mr. Bang' imprinted on the sides. She checks the chamber of each, as well as the ammo clips, and then returns them to the case and clamps it shut. She unzips her uniform and puts on the business suit. She then gathers up the uniform, stuffs it into the box, and shuts it. She then opens the emergency hatch and shoves the box through the hatch on the top of the car. Finally, she presses the 'STOP' button again, and the elevator resumes its course. The jarring of the elevator resuming its course stirs Wade from his unconscious state, and he emits a low groan. Ajax cracks Wade across the forehead, sending him back into dreamland, once again. She removes a set of keys from his belt. She then picks Wade up and stuffs him up through the emergency hatch and shuts the hatch door. INT. â 27th Floor Landing â day The Elevator dings and the doors open. Out steps Ajax in the business suit, glasses and blonde wig. The landing is empty, save for a scrawny young man in a business suit, who is busy banging on a nearby candy machine, trying to rattle out a chocolate bar thatâs stuck in the machine. He pays no attention to Ajax as she walks out of the elevator. Ajax walks over to him. AJAX Did it get stuck? BUSINESSMAN Hehâ¦ Yeah. AJAX What kind were you trying to get? BUSINESSMAN A 'Choc-A-Lot.' Really, I donât know why I even bother with this stupid machine, sometimes. Itâs notorious for taking my money and getting the candy stuck. I was just so hungry this morning that I couldnât help myself. Ajax smiles and nods at the man. She then puts her fist through the front glass of the candy machine, snatches out several candy bars for inside the machine, and places them into the dumbfounded manâs hands. AJAX Here. I imagine that should make up for a few previous losses. BUSINESSMAN Th-Thanksâ¦ Ajax walks off, leaving the dumbstruck businessman staring after her. INT. â Office Hallway â day Office workers scurry around like ants throughout the long hallway. Ajax strides down the hallway, pert and sunny as ever, dodging businesspeople as effortlessly as she did in the lobby, when dressed as the delivery girl. INT. â Office Hallway â day The camera dollies past the office doors, revealing that each has a nameplate fixed to each. It pans along the hallway, until it reaches the door with the name 'Skyler Luntz' embossed upon the nameplate. It holds there for a couple of beats, and suddenly, Ajax walks by the door, without stopping. She finally stops at a door marked 'Authorized Personnel Only.' The door has a keycard lock. CLOSEUP ON AJAXâS POCKET As she removes Wadeâs keys. The camera follows her hand as it brings the key to the lock and turns the handle. A click is heard. INT. â Office Hallway â day Checking to see that no one is watching, Ajax slips inside. INT. â Executive Hallway â day Ajax finds herself in a long, steel-blue-painted hallway. Another elevator resides at the other end of the hall. She strides briskly towards the elevator landing. Two business suit-clad security operatives rush towards her from around a corner. OPERATIVE #1 Hold it! Stay right where you are! Ajax stops in her tracks. She doesnât seem the least bit cautious or even concerned at the two imposing men running towards her. In fact, she looks quite interested and amused; like a child watching a caterpillar crawl across her arm. OPERATIVE #2 Lay down on the floor with your hands out and away from you! She suddenly flings her briefcase at the second operativeâs chest. It slams into him hard and sends him straight to the floor, gasping for air. The first operative reaches into his coat for a weapon. Ajax grabs him by the throat with blinding speed and slams his head hard against the wall with such force that a huge splatter of blood erupts from the impact point. The operative slumps to the floor and does not move. Her sunny facial expression has not changed once during the course of this carnage. Ajax walks over to the gasping security operative on the floor. She bends down and picks up the briefcase. Then, she steps on the operativeâs neck. A sickening crack is heard. Ajax walks away, as if nothing has happened. Two more security operatives emerge from the corridor, already brandishing their pistols. They say nothing, but commence firing upon Ajax. She begins running towards them, picking up insane speed. The bullets whiz by her, grazing her clothes and hair. She suddenly leaps towards the gunmen, tackling one and kicking the gun out of the still-standing gunmanâs hand from the ground. She snaps the neck of the tackled guard, and low-roundhouse-kicks the other man off of his feet. The second guardâs pistol is just out of his reach from where he has fallen, and he makes a quick grab for it. Before he is able to reach the pistol, however, Ajax has grabbed the first guardâs pistol and fires a round into his forehead. She gets up and examines her clothing. Itâs bloodstained, singed and frayed in places from where it was clipped by the guardsâ gunfire. Her wig is messy and singed in places as well. She removes the glasses, suit coat and wig, and makes her way to the landing. INT. â Executive Hallway Landing â day Ajax cautiously peeks around the corner. The landing is surprisingly free of guards. She steps forward onto the landing and is about to use the guardâs keys on the locked elevator button when a loud bang is heard and she is thrown sideways across the room by a huge concussive blast. Across the room, she is picking herself up, amongst much of the rubble that had previously been most of the surrounding wall. A large, robotic foot steps down with a loud clunk in front of the cameraâs view. The robot is huge; at least 10 feet tall and solid bulk. The center of its head sports a large monitor screen, which displays a digitized skull and crossbones. Its arms each sport a trio of heavy, talon-like digits that look like they could easily shatter bones in a fraction of a second. Set in the middle of the claws is a pair of large barrels, about the size of a childâs head. One of the barrels is wafting a small stream of smoke. It strides towards her, and postures menacingly. Ajax smiles pleasantly. AJAX Hi there! She suddenly charges the sentry robot, guns blazing. The bullets ricochet off the robotâs shiny armor. It grabs Ajax by the arm and swings her across the room and straight into a wall. Her impact leaves a sizeable crater in the marble wall. She picks herself up and dusts herself off. The cheerful smile hasnât left her face. She giggles as the robot bears down on her. AJAX Oops. My mistake. Letâs try a new approach, shall we? The robot charges towards her. Itâs monitor screen depicts a snarling, frothing, barking Rottweiler. She grabs a sizeable chunk of marble and hurls it at the robotâs head. It impacts with the monitor screen, which shatters. The robot swings itâs arms around in confusion, and inadvertently backhands Ajax. She goes sailing across the room, but shifts herself around in midair and rebounds off the wall. An even more pronounced grin forms cross her face. She charges at the flailing robot, dodging its flailing arms this time, and baseball slides beneath itâs massive legs. She rights herself, and rips a small panel off the robotâs back, as easily as if it were made of paper. She then thrusts her hand inside the exposed hole and begins ripping out wiring. The robot whirrs to a halt and stills, as if it were an inactive marionette. AJAX Nowâ¦ Where were we? She finds the keys on the floor, amid the rubble. AJAX Oh, yes. She places the key in the keyhole, and turns the key. The button pops out. She presses the button, and a beep is heard. The doors open to reveal an elevator. She enters, humming to herself; a smile still beaming across her face. INT. â Secured Area Elevator â day The elevator is very stark. The only feature therein is chrome box with two buttons, indicating up or down. Ajax presses the up button, and the doors quickly shut. She discharges the clips from her pistols and they clatter to the floor. Then, she unbuttons her shirt. She holds out her arm and runs her finger gently across the base of her wrist. A soft whirring sound is heard and her skin appears to melt away in a small, rectangular pattern along her forearm. She presses the pattern and the patch of skin flips up, revealing a small control panel. She presses the buttons in a short sequence and two more panels appear on her sides. These pop out, and reveal two small compartments, each storing fresh clips. She removes two and reloads each of her pistols. AJAX Never again. These shirts just donât work right for this kind of thingâ¦ The two compartment slots close automatically, and skin develops around them, again, making them appear as if they had never been there at all. She closes the flap on her arm, and the skin around the panel door redevelops, then she buttons her shirt again. INT. â Secured Area Landing â day The elevator reaches its destination and Ajax readies herself, pointing her guns directly at the door. They open on landing where nearly twenty security operatives, much like the ones upstairs stand to meet her, their guns aiming straight at her. Ajax unloads round after round at the initial guards. She leapfrogs over one guard, kicking two other guards hard in the throat as she jumps. She flips around him, and wraps one arm around his neck and fires at guards with her other. Bullet holes erupt on the captive guardâs chest, as she continues to fire. She smiles happily. AJAX One, twoâ¦ Two guardsâ heads erupt in fountains of blood. AJAX Buckle my shoe. Three, fourâ¦ Two more guardsâ heads blast open. AJAX Shut the door. Fiveâ¦ One more guardâs head collapses. There are no more guards standing. She looks disappointed. AJAX Darnâ¦ She lets go of her human shield and skips merrily down the hall. The door at the end of the hall is shut. There are no markings on the door, nor is there a visible handle. Ajax pays this no mind and kicks it in. INT. â Secured Area Meeting Room â day AJAX Candygram! Hargove Crane, Denis Crane, and seven important-looking old men sit seated at a long table. There are huge, muscular, armed guards flanked at either side of the door. Ajax unloads the remainders of her clips at them. They slump to the floor in bloody heaps. She grins happily at the shocked men. AJAX You guys are the Board of Directors, right? I just want to make sure that I came to the right place. Crane and Denis cast frantic glances at each other, and rise from their seats in alarm. An old man in the center chair looks as though heâs about to have a heart attack. AJAX Nowâ¦ Which of you is Lou Davenport? Crane stares at Ajax, whoâs looking around the room with an expression like this is a big guessing game. AJAX Waitâ¦ Donât tell meâ¦ I want to see if I can figure it out. CRANE Lou Davenportâs dead. He died two days ago. Who the hell are you? AJAX Me? Iâm Universal Improvement Industries Food Service Droid, Unit LY-491. Reformatted and retrofitted for executions and sabotage. The two slats open up on her thighs and a pair of pistols emerge on small racks. She removes them and the slats close. She smiles at the board members, who murmur in alarm. AJAX Simply put, my nameâs Ajax. I kill people and break things. She twirls the pistols in her hands and points them at the council. AJAX Hargrove Crane sends his regards. CRANE But Iâm Hargrove Cra- She fires one round from her pistol and shoots Crane between the eyes. He slumps back in his chair, dead. Denis and the board members stare at her in fear and panic. They call for help that will not be coming. Ajax giggles and opens fire on the board members. Ajax surveys the carnage the sheâs just wrought. Nine men dead, and the room covered in blood and bits of skin, flesh and bone. She giggles softly to herself. AJAX Wowâ¦ I sure did make a mess. She shrugs, holsters her pistols, and heads back towards the elevator, humming to herself. INT. â Office Hallway â day Ajax emerges from behind the security door. Sheâs back in her business suit again, even though it looks like sheâs been wearing it through a war zone. People gawk at her as she walk by, but she pays this no notice. She walks to the door with the name 'Skyler Luntz' embossed upon the nameplate, and walks inside. INT. â Luntzâs Office â day Skyler Luntz sits at his desk, yelling into the phone. He is a loud, skinny man in his mid-30âs, with curly hair thatâs showing signs of thinning. He doesnât seem to notice that Ajax has walked into the room. LUNTZ No! Damn it, Paul, No! Dark blue is NOT fucking what I asked for! I told you that I wanted the car in midnight blue, and no other color. I donât give a shit if thatâs all that you were able to find in the city. Iâm already paying you a ridiculous goddamn amount for this goddamn car, so you better try fucking harder! I donât want to hear thisâ¦ He looks up and notices Ajax. LUNTZ Who the fuck are you? EXT: Crane Industries Building â Day Glass shatters from one of the high floors of the building and Skyler Luntz goes sailing out of the windows. He screams and plummets to the pavement. EXT. â Rooftop â day Ajax jump out the window and lands on the rooftop of the next building over. Next to the rooftop exit is another Crixus Courier box. She picks up the box and removes a pair of cutoffs and a t-shirt. She goes through the exit door. EXT. â City Street â day Ajax emerges onto the street from the building next to the Crane building. She is no longer in her executive dress, but in the clothes from the box. Her hair is back to messy red. She glances at the crowd gathered around Luntzâs smashed body. No one seems to notice her as she crosses the street and walks away. FADE OUT FADE IN EXT: City Street â Night Ajax walks down a busy, dingy city street, a vision of cleanliness and beauty among such decay and ruin. A shabbily dressed man with a bald head, largely covered in tattoos (the most noticeable, being a large back spider tattooed across his face), emerges from the shadows and starts following her. TATTOOED MAN Hey, Gorgeous! Whatâs your hurry? Ajax stops and smiles pleasantly at the grungy man. AJAX Iâm trying to find some people I know. The tattooed man smiles. It is an ugly, leering smile. TATTOOED MAN Well, Iâm someone. I can be your friend, tooâ¦ Can I be your friend, Doll? AJAX Well, I donât see why not! She holds her free hand out to the tattooed man. Heâs rather surprised at this. This canât be right. This is too easy. TATTOOED MAN Ooo-Kayâ¦ They call me 'Spider.' AJAX Thatâs a nice name. Why do they call you that? The tattooed man flashes her a very quizzical look. Slowly, he points his index finger up to the large spider tattoo that covers much of his face. AJAX Ohhhhhhhhhhhâ¦ I see. The tattooed man nods tentatively. This girl canât be for real. She just canât! TATTOOED MAN Whatâs, uhâ¦ Whatâs your name, Doll? AJAX Well, my friend Bishop calls me Ajax. I donât know why, reallyâ¦ I donât really have a name, if you want to get right down to itâ¦ The tattooed man looks puzzled by this statement. He shrugs it off though. Itâs not like this crazy bitch is going to be around much longer, anyway. AJAX Well, I need to get going. Iâll see you later, OK? She starts to walk away. He follows after her. TATTOOED MAN No, waitâ¦ Iâve got some friends whoâd love to meet you. Would you like to meet some new friends? AJAXMaybe some other time. TATTOOED MAN Itâll only take a second. CâMonâ¦ She keeps walking. AJAX No, some other time. Sorry, Spider. The tattooed man suddenly grabs her arm forcefully. TATTOOED MAN No, I think youâll be coming with me, right now, Doll. She flashes him a cheerfully puzzled look. AJAX Oh, OKâ¦ But Iâve only got a minute. INT: Alley - night He yanks her along, trying to seem forceful and threatening, even though sheâs walking at normal speed and slightly amused at the way heâs acting. They end up in a dark alleyway. Three hulking figures are standing there, waiting. TATTOOED MAN I brought something for you guys to snack on. AJAX Hi! Whatâre your names? Two of the hulking men grab Ajax by the arms. The man on the right has a massive robotic arm. TATTOOED MAN Shut up. He pulls out a sizeable knife and waves it threateningly at her. She watches the blade with rapt curiosity. TATTOOED MAN Are you scared yet, Doll? AJAX Nahâ¦ I just thought that was a really nice knife. Iâve got a couple, myself, but that one is really neat. Do you know where I might get one, myself? The tattooed man smiles at her. Itâs an even more menacing smile than the one he gave her on the street. He slashes at her shirt, ripping it. Ajax looks shocked. The hulking men laugh. AJAX Hey! Your ruined my shirt! This is the only one I have! The tattooed man breaks out in a fit of laughter. TATTOOED MAN If I were you, Girlie, Iâd be worried about more than my shirtâ¦ Not that itâs gonna do you much good. Youâre in for a lot of rips and tears before weâre through with you, Sweetheart. All three men laugh stupidly and evilly. Ajax frowns and narrows her eyes. AJAX Youâre not a very nice man, Spider. I donât think you can be my friend, after all. TATTOOED MAN Awww, now thatâs a shame. And here I thought we were getting along so well. He lunges for her. She kicks up and lands a foot in his groin. He screams and doubles over. The third man advances on her and the two men holding her tighten their grip. Ajax stomps down hard on the man on the leftâs foot. A crunching sound is heard. He howls in pain and lets go of her arm. She then grabs the remaining manâs mechanical arm with both hands and pulls hard. It rips away from the large man in a shower of blood and sparks. He screams and falls to the ground, clutching the remains of his bloody, smoking shoulder with his remaining arm. Ajax brandishes the arm like an oversized club and baseball swings it at the oncoming third man. It connects with the bridge of his nose with a sickening crunch. He roars in pain and comes at her again. She easily dodges out of his path, and he crashes headlong into a dumpster. He clutches his chest in pain. His ribs have been broken in the impact. She turns around and beats him repeatedly with the mechanical arm until he is motionless. The now-one-armed man lies screaming, quivering in pain. Ajax snaps his thick neck like a tree branch. He makes a strangled grunt. Spider, sputtering and wheezing, makes it to his feet, and attempts to run away. A swishing sound is heard, followed by a stabbing noise. He suddenly stiffens, mid-stride and falls to the pavement. His huge knife protrudes from his back. Ajax stands behind him, grinning. AJAX Mind if I take this? She rips the knife out of Spiderâs back. He screams, and a sickening, tearing sound can be heard. AJAX Before I go, do you want to see my knives? She unsheathes the bayonets housed in her wrists, and grins pleasantly on Spider. He manages a terrified shriek as the camera fades to black. FADE OUT FADE IN EXT: City Street â Morning CLOSE-UP as a fly darts hither and yon on Spiderâs dead face. The sound of police-band radio and crime-scene photography flashes resound. Two sets of footsteps approach. Shadows of two people engulf Spiderâs face. VOICE #1 Jesus, what a messâ¦ Meat wagon gonna get here any time soon? VOICE #2 Theyâve been here for about 20 minutes, Sir. The camera cuts to the owners of the two voices. Both are plain-clothes policemen. One is young, around mid-20âs, and dressed sharply in a suit and tie. The other is older, 45 or so, and dressed in a rumpled trenchcoat and a fedora hat, covering his vintage suit. He is horribly scarred. His left eye is pure white and stares off into nothingness. FRANKENSTEIN (formerly VOICE #1) So why havenât they gotten around to cleaning this up yet? QUAGMIRE (formerly VOICE #2) Probably because theyâre not done puking, yet, Iâd imagine. Cut to panning shot of the crime scene. The bodies of Ajaxâs assailants were gutted and hog-tied, with their small intestines binding their hands and feet together. Each length of innards is tied with an intricate bow. The heads of Spider and his companions have been separated from their respective bodies and sit neatly in a row. A dirty, frayed napkin has been folded ornately and placed atop Spiderâs head, like a grungy party hat. FRANKENSTEIN Understandable. QUAGMIRE Maybe itâs a matter of you being around the block more times than I have, Boss, but I gotta tell youâ¦ This is by far the most fucked-up thing Iâve ever seen. Frankenstein nods. FRANKENSTEIN Frankenstein glances at a couple of nearby uniformed policemen, bagging evidence. FRANKENSTEIN Have we found a murder weapon yet? POLICEMAN #1 Not yet. We did find this, though. He tosses the evidence bag to Frankenstein. Inside the clear, plastic bag are shredded fragments of a pink t-shirt. Frankenstein surveys the fabric with a grim look about his grizzled face. FRANKENSTEIN Strange thing to find in the middle of this mess, donât you think, Farley? QUAGMIRE What is that? T-shirt material? FRANKENSTEIN That would appear to be the case. If you look close, you can see the screen-printing on the edge of it. QUAGMIRE There doesnât seem to be any blood or anything on the fabric, from what I can tell. Thereâs dirt, but itâs more than likely just from this grungy alleyway. Frankenstein nods. FRANKENSTEIN Any locals see or hear anything? POLICEMAN #2 We havenât heard anything yet, Frankenstein. Scarsdaleâs trying to take what statements he can from the few bums whoâve set up living quarters nearby. FRANKENSTEIN Let me know what he hears ASAP. And keep looking for that weapon, ladies. INT: Clothing Store â Day Spiderâs knife is set down upon a glass countertop with a clack. Itâs been cleaned of any blood or smudges and shines brightly under fluorescent lights. Next to the knife is a small pink T-shirt. Pan up to a flustered store clerk. CLERK What is this? A robbery? Ajax smiles brightly at the clerk. Sheâs still wearing the ripped shirt, although itâs been stapled and knotted together. AJAX No, Sillyâ¦ Iâm buying this shirt. The clerk looks severely annoyed now. CLERK This isnât a trading post, Lady. We donât operate under a barter-system. Only cash and credit. AJAXBut I donât have any money. CLERK Well, thatâs not my problem. Go pawn that thing off somewhere. AJAXBut I donâtâ¦ CLERK Security! A big, burly guard appears out of nowhere and places his hand on Ajaxâs shoulder. INT: Pot of Gold Gun & Pawn back room â Night Bishop is sitting in a brand new, expensive chair, smoking a large, fat Cuban cigar. Heâs letting a huge wad of cash flap like a deck of cards, reveling in the sound. He casts a disdainful look over at Rosie, whoâs tinkering on a small, robot dog. BISHOP Jesus, would you give that shit a rest for five minutes? Christ, weâre independently wealthy nowâ¦ We can finally close this pit down. We donât ever have to bother with the crap anymore, if we donât want to. ROSIE Thatâs just it, Ernieâ¦ I want to. BISHOP Whatever. Stay broke and married to this dump. See if I care. Me, Iâve got bigger fish to fryâ¦ O/C, we hear the dinging and creaking sound of the front door opening. BISHOP Jesus H. Christâ¦ He labors to get out of his big, cushy chair. Rosie puts her screwdriver down. ROSIE Donât hurt yourself, Ernie. Iâll take care of it. She exits the room. The robot dog looks at Bishop. It growls at him. Bishop flicks his cigar butt at it. It bounces off the dogâs chrome muzzle. Rosie peeks her head through the door at Bishop. She has a look of deep surprise on her face. ROSIE Um, Ernie? I think you might want to come up here, after allâ¦ INT: Pot of Gold Gun &amp; Pawn sale floor â Night Bishop stumbles through the door to the sale floor. BISHOP What? Whatâs so damn imporâ¦ Bishopâs jaw drops. Ajax is standing in the middle of the sale floor, looking positively giddy to see both him and Rosie. BISHOP What the hell is she doing here?! AJAX Well, I didnât know where I was supposed to go or what I was supposed to do next. So, I went to find you both and await further instructions. ROSIE Does anyone know that youâre here? AJAX To my knowledge, no. I met a couple of people on my way here, and I informed them that I was looking for some people I knewâ¦ BISHOP Oh, wonderfulâ¦ What do they know about you and where you were going? AJAX Very little, really. Anyway, they proved to be rather unfriendly, and I was forced to deal with them. She turns around and points to the bloody stain on the back of the filthy coat. ROSIE Well, at least that problemâs been cleared up. She holds up a copy of the Chronicle. Below the fold, a headline reads, 'Downtown Car Blast Kills Two; Terrorism Suspected.' ROSIE And no ties back to us from the Wonder Twins, considering theyâre now Blackened Cajun Morons. BISHOP Well, what are we going to do with her? ROSIE I donât know, Ernie. I wasnât expecting her to come back here. BISHOP Well, neither was I! ROSIE Oh, no shit, Sherlock? Ajax watches, with rapt adoration, as the two siblings bicker. BISHOP Well, we need to figure out something to do with her. ROSIE Of course. I imagine I could put her to work here, but sheâs really not very suited to stuff around here, in her present condition. I imagine I could retrofit her again, but I worry about too many program changes. Not to mention the time it would take to remove all the weapons and stuffâ¦ A look of epiphany comes across Bishopâs face. BISHOP Wait a minuteâ¦ Rose casts a puzzled look at him. ROSIE What? BISHOP Who said we had to change her? ROSIE Well, I just figured that sheâd have an easier time around here, if she knew more about basic operations andâ¦ BISHOP (cutting in) No! Donât you touch her! He stands in front of Ajax, with his hands out, as if he was trying to protect her from Rosie. Ajax looks over his shoulder with a look of puzzled amusement. ROSIE Ernie, what are you doing? BISHOP Donât change her again. Just think about how much money this little darling just made for us! She could keep making us money by doing the same thing, over and over and over! Rosie rolls her eyes. ROSIE Ernie, donât be ridiculousâ¦ Thereâs no way that would work. BISHOP How do you know? Jesus Christ, Sisâ¦ A gold mine just walked back into your store, and youâre not even considering taking a little for yourself? ROSIE Neither of us is in the murder racket, Ernie. We buy and sell crap. We fix the occasional appliance, droid, whatever. I donât know the first thing about getting into the assassin business, and neither do you. BISHOP I doubt itâs all that tough, Rosie. You kill a person here, you kill a person there. You kill enough people, and you stay alive long enough, you get yourself a reputation. Word of mouth travels, and boom. Thereâs the big time. Rosie claps sarcastically. ROSIE Oh, Bravo, Ernieâ¦ You simplified that so well. Jesus, Iâm surprised I hadnât thought of that. Why in Godâs name Iâve been wasting my time here, Iâll never know. Bishop ignores her obvious sarcasm and plods on. BISHOP Lookâ¦ All Iâm saying is that it would be completely stupid not to take this opportunity when itâs pretty-much fallen into our lapsâ¦ Erâ¦ He looks downward at her torso. Rosie glares and him and points a finger at him threateningly. ROSIE Donât you even say it, Ernie. I know youâre itching to, but donât. BISHOP Or, what? Youâll roll over my foot? ROSIE Just knock it off, Ernie. I mean it. BISHOP Fine. If youâre going to be too stupid to cash in when youâve had the chance, then you can stay poor. Best of luck to you, Sis. (to Ajax) CâMon. Weâre leaving. He grabs Ajax by the arm and leads her out the door. She looks politely confused, and a little troubled to be leaving Rosie behind. When Bishop reaches the door, he shunts Ajax through. He then stops and turns to Rosie. BISHOP Iâll be back in a couple of days for my share of the cash. He turns to leave, stops, then turns to face Rosie again. BISHOP Oh, and my chair, too. Lord knows youâll have no use for it. He turns and slams the door behind him, leaving Rosie alone and staring at the door. FADE OUT SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: SIX MONTHS LATER FADE IN INT. â Apartment â day The camera fades in on what appears to be an old ladyâs apartment.     _________________________________________ TO BE WRITTEN INTO CONTINUITY _________________________________________ EXT. - Courtyard - evening The shot opens up in a lush, perfectly manicured garden, overlooked by a large, ornate mansion. Ajax is walking down the paved pathway of the garden with a very old man in a wheelchair, being pushed by a large, blond amazon of a woman. AJAX The dragon was placed on the table, as per your instructions. The old man looks up at her and smiles. This is Heinrich von Zell. Though in his 80's, he has a deep air of authority and shrewdness, which hasn't dulled in the least bit, despite his age. VON ZELL Ah, Sehr Gut. I congratulate you, Fraulein. You have exceeded my expectations utterly, and such is not always an easy thing to do. Ajax smiles sheepishly at the compliment. VON ZELL You will stay for a drink, yes? We have much to discuss with regards to your future with this organization. AJAX Of course. They head towards the door of the house. INT: Mansion Lounge - Evening von Zell sits in a sumptuous leather chair, holding a snifter of brandy. Greta, his Amazonian attendant, stands silently behind him. Ajax sits across from him, looking pleasant as usual. VON ZELL First and foremost, your reward for services rendered. Greta produces a large briefcase. She opens it up for Ajax. It is filled with cash. She shuts it, and passes it across the table. von Zell watches Ajax shrewdly and sips from his glass. He sits for a moment. VON ZELL My apologies. The thought of you not being able to imbibe food or drink had not even crossed my mind. AJAX No apologies necessary. VON ZELL It is a great asset that you have that your actions and behavior don't betray your true self. I, myself, admit to being fooled into thinking that you were a true human, until you proved otherwise. He regards his drink for a moment. VON ZELL Many people would not even consider allowing automatons to dine with them, much less even converse with them, but I am not most people, much as you are not like most automatons. Ajax smiles politely. VON ZELL On the whole, Fraulein, I value efficiency and effectiveness. You have impressed me with your actions, and, as such, you have earned the right to become part of my establishment, regardless of your...status. AJAX It is an honor, Sir. VON ZELL An interesting statement, Fraulein. Though I did not think that honor was a trait which automatons possessed. AJAX Technically, Sir, we can't. On the whole, my processor can calculate each new variable that adds or detracts to the situation and can judge its import from there. While I am not physically able to feel true feelings of honor, and a regular person would, I can dictate that it is an important addition to my master-servant protocols and so I can act accordingly, from there. von Zell laughs. VON ZELL There is no need to get technical, or even explain yourself, Fraulein. I was simply amused by the statement. Ajax nods, looking rather sheepish. VON ZELL Were you able to understand the meaning of the dragon that I had you leave with the council? I understand that you and I have not met face to face before this night, and I am curious if you understood its significance. AJAX I know that from 1984 to 2020, you were involved with a group in Berlin, known as Zahn das Drachen, or 'The Dragon's Tooth,' which was involved in many illegal activities throughout Germany and much of Europe. The group dissolved shortly, thereafter, and you took up residence in Triad City. Since that time, some form of a dragon symbol at the scene of various acts of theft, violence, murder and destruction. I would assume that the dragon had something to do with that. VON ZELL You have done your homework, Fraulein. Again, I am impressed. Yes, the dragon has become my symbol, and I used it to relay a symbol to those who cross either my establishment or myself. ClichÃ©, yes... But old ways are sometimes the best ways, are they not? AJAX Indeed they are. VON ZELL The beautiful thing is that the organizations tied to the council will do their best to keep your handiwork entirely out of the media. Criminal organizations tend to keep matters like this strictly in-house, for fear of embarrassment or possible police investigations into their 'businesses.' Ajax nods. VON ZELL The dragon serves as a message to them that I am greater than any 'Council of Bosses.' That I can send people in to remove their leaders, slaughter their guards, and take whatever I please. That I and I alone, rule Triad City. Von Zell smiles smugly to himself. VON ZELL Of course, they will try to exact revenge upon me... But I am more prepared for such actions than they even realize. I will not be brought down so easily by petty thugs and hoodlums. Von Zell laughs softy, but his chortles are soon replaced by a fit of violent coughing. Ajax rises and moves toward him, but Greta holds out a hand to block her. She reaches for a small pitcher of water on a nearby writing desk, and pours a small glass. She offers the glass to Von Zell, as well as a small handkerchief. Soon, his coughing subsides. VON ZELL Thank you, Greta. (to Ajax) My apologies... My health has not been favorable in recent months. Ajax says nothing. She merely smiles politely. Von Zell whispers something into Greta's ear. She produces a manilla envelope from the writing desk. VON ZELL I will not beat around the bush, my dear. Here is your assignment, which I will be,,, His words trail off as another coughing fit resumes and he fades out of consciousness. Greta runs to a panel on the wall and presses a combination of buttons on the keypad. Two men dressed in white coats and pushing a stretcher rush in. Greta nods and motions to the unconscious Von Zell. Her silent face is marked with panic and dread. The men say nothing, and load Von Zell onto the stretcher. They rush back out. Greta hands the envelope to Ajax, who has been watching this all with a look of puzzled curiosity on her face, and escorts her to the door. When she is gone, Greta turns around and goes into a dead sprint towards the stairs.   INT. - Elevator Landing - evening Greta is standing next to the stretcher, carrying the unconscious Von Zell. He has an oxygen mask covering much of his ancient face, and what breathing he does do is quite shallow. She squeezes his hand slightly, and tears roll down her face. The elevator opens and the two med techs roll him in. INT. - Medical Lab - evening The elevator doors roll open and the med techs roll the stretcher to an operating table. A large, four-armed scientist is prepping for surgery. Behind him is a large machine with a huge glass dome set in the middle of the top. Inside the dome is a thick, purple liquid. One of the med techs looks at the scientist with a look of apprehension. MED TECH For the record, I don't think that we should be doing this yet. SCIENTIST Duly noted. Unfortunately, we have no choice in the matter. Orders are orders, and Mr. Von Zell specifically told us that we were to initiate the transfer as soon as we were able to. It appears that we have to do it a little sooner than we were prepared for. MED TECH But his body isn't ready yet! The Scientist picks Von Zell's body up and lays him on the operating table. SCIENTIST It's functional enough to initiate the transfer. It just hasn't matured as much as I was planning on before this operation was to take place. The med tech looks at him with a slightly panicked look on his face. SCIENTIST Look, if you have any other option, you're welcome to spill it out. If he comes through, and realizes that we didn't follow his orders specifically, you're welcome to tell him all about your reservations. If not, then help me get him ready for transferal. The med techs say nothing. They remove Von Zell's robe and shirt. The scientist preps an I.V. and attaches it to Von Zell's arm. A robot lumbers forth, carrying a large device, with a curious headpiece attached to it. Needles attached to wires, which connect back to the device, surround its contours. The med techs plug two long cords into the large machine behind the operating table. The headpiece is placed on Von Zell's head, and fixed to his scalp. The needles snap down and lock into place within his scalp. Greta shudders. The scientist walks over to her and puts one of his arms around her. SCIENTIST I'll be all right. Trust me. Greta nods and walks over to a seat across the room, where she breaks down into silent sobs. Back at the operating area, the techs strap Von Zell's limp body to the table. The scientist walks over to the robot and places his hand on the machine it holds. SCIENTIST Now, when I initiate the transferal, his body may go into sever convulsions. Above all, I want you to make sure that his head is VERY secure. We don't want a single one of those wire slipping out, or it could be disastrous. If it comes down to it, I want you to hold him as steady as you can without damaging any of the equipment. One slight nudge and we might lose part of him. The med techs nod. The scientist turns toward the machine. SCIENTIST All right. Initiating transferal... Now. He flips a switch on the machine, and it hums to life. Von Zell's body begins to slightly twitch. SCIENTIST Hold him down, gentlemen. CLOSE UP on Von Zell's face. We see Von Zell's unconscious face shake and shudder. Fading in over his visage are scenes of dark, transparent aspects of his life. All show the full life of a very rich and evil man. Violence, greed, sex, power. An old shopkeeper's head hollowed out by a shotgun blast. A beautiful topless women smiling and laughing seductively. Cars exploding. Showers of money cascading down. People being beat mercilessly by mobs of street toughs. A younger Von Zell driving in a convertible down a beautiful countryside, with an even more beautiful man at his side. Newspaper images, newsreel footage, television interviews and photo ops. More violence, more sex, more greed, more power. The images begin to overlap each other and spin around in circles, as if being caught in a drain. They spin faster and faster, then suddenly split in to several long, thin strips and drin themselves into the wires attached to Von Zell's head. His mind and his memories have been siphoned into this machine. Von Zell's body goes limp. His heart rate continues to beat weakly on the monitor, but he is dead inside; an empty, lifeless husk. SCIENTIST Phase one is complete. His thought processes have fully transferred into the system. Is the new host ready? MED TECH Yeah. It's in stasis inside the incubator. SCIENTIST Bring it up. We're ready to begin phase two. Both techs move to either side of the large, domed machine. They grab hold of large levers and push them forward. The domed machine whirrs to life and the purple fluid inside the tank begins to bubble and thrash behind the glass. Panels in the bottom of the tank open and the level of purple fluid rises. A small shapeless form rises from the portal in the bottom of the tank. A long, gray cable is attached to the form. SCIENTIST Initiating phase two. He flips a large switch on the tank machine's control panel. Lights flash and the form in the take begins to convulse and pulsate. CLOSE UP on Control panel. A pie chart depicted on a monitor screen is slowly filling up. SCIENTIST Phase two complete. All we can do now is sit and wait. FADE OUT INT. â Bishopâs Car â day Behind the wheel of the black car is Ernie Bishop. He glares at Ajax in the rear-view mirror. BISHOP So, Iâm guessing you got it done, right? Ajax smiles softly. AJAX Yes. Everything that Herr Von Zell requested. BISHOP He didnât want trophies this time? AJAX No, he said that their finding the dragon with the bodies would be just what was necessary. Bishop grunts a surly acknowledgement. BISHOP What the hell was all that commotion back there? AJAX Remember Mary-Ann Luntz, that lady we met at the deli the other day? BISHOP You met her. I could give a fuck about the people whoâre in there when I am. AJAX Anyway, she told me how her husband was cheating on herâ¦ BISHOP I canât believe that complete fucking strangers tell you this shit. What the fuck is wrong with people? Ajax smiles patiently. AJAX She said that sheâd love to kill him, herself, but she was scared of losing her family if she ever got caught. BISHOP So, youâ¦ Ajax nods. AJAX Out the 21st floor window. Bishop slams on the breaks. He turns around to face Ajax and glares at her. BISHOP God Damn it, what have I told you about these penny-ante killing jobs? They donât pay worth a shit, and nine times out of ten, you run the risk of getting caught. They arenât even worth your time, so you should be avoiding them like the fucking plague. AJAX I know, Bishop. BISHOP If you knew, then you wouldnât be doing it in the first fucking place. He turns around and resumes driving. BISHOP Nobody saw you do it, did they? AJAX If anyone did, I was in costume, and itâd be difficult to place. BISHOP Donât be so sure about that. (beat) How much are we making for this side job, anyway? AJAX Nothing yet. At least, nothing until the heat dies down from it. She said she didnât want to be implicated if she could help it. BISHOP So, essentially, you took a job for nothing. Jesusâ¦ AJAX Just trying to be nice, Bishop. BISHOP Youâre not supposed to be nice. Not in this fucking business. I swear, if you werenât a prime cash cow for me, Iâd drop your dumb clockwork ass in a heartbeat. Ajax smiles patiently. EXT. â City Street â day The black car speeds away. EXT. â Courtyard â evening The shot opens up in a lush, perfectly manicured garden, overlooked by a large, ornate mansion. Ajax is walking down the paved pathway of the garden with a very old man in a wheelchair, being pushed by a large, blond amazon of a woman. AJAX The dragon was placed on the table, as per your instructions. The old man looks up at her and smiles. This is Heinrich von Zell. Though in his 80âs, he has a deep air of authority and shrewdness, which hasnât dulled in the least bit, despite his age. VON ZELL Ah, Sehr Gut. I congratulate you, Fraulein. You have exceeded my expectations utterly, and such is not always an easy thing to do. Ajax smiles sheepishly at the compliment. VON ZELL You will stay for a drink, yes? We have much to discuss with regards to your future with this organization. AJAX Of course. They head towards the door of the house. INT: Mansion Lounge â Evening von Zell sits in a sumptuous leather chair, holding a snifter of brandy. Greta, his Amazonian attendant, stands silently behind him. Ajax sits across from him, looking pleasant as usual. VON ZELL First and foremost, your reward for services rendered. Greta produces a large briefcase. She opens it up for Ajax. It is filled with cash. She shuts it, and passes it across the table. von Zell watches Ajax shrewdly and sips from his glass. He sits for a moment. VON ZELL My apologies. The thought of you not being able to imbibe food or drink had not even crossed my mind. AJAX No apologies necessary. VON ZELL It is a great asset that you have that your actions and behavior donât betray your true self. I, myself, admit to being fooled into thinking that you were a true human, until you proved otherwise. He regards his drink for a moment. VON ZELL Many people would not even consider allowing automatons to dine with them, much less even converse with them, but I am not most people, much as you are not like most automatons. Ajax smiles politely. VON ZELL On the whole, Fraulein, I value efficiency and effectiveness. You have impressed me with your actions, and, as such, you have earned the right to become part of my establishment, regardless of yourâ¦status. AJAX It is an honor, Sir. VON ZELL An interesting statement, Fraulein. Though I did not think that honor was a trait which automatons possessed. AJAX Technically, Sir, we canât. On the whole, my processor can calculate each new variable that adds or detracts to the situation and can judge its import from there. While I am not physically able to feel true feelings of honor, and a regular person would, I can dictate that it is an important addition to my master-servant protocols and so I can act accordingly, from there. von Zell laughs. VON ZELL There is no need to get technical, or even explain yourself, Fraulein. I was simply amused by the statement. Ajax nods, looking rather sheepish. VON ZELL Were you able to understand the meaning of the dragon that I had you leave with the council? I understand that you and I have not met face to face before this night, and I am curious if you understood its significance. AJAX I know that from 1984 to 2027, you were involved with a group in Berlin, known as Zahn das Drachen, or 'The Dragonâs Tooth,' which was involved in many illegal activities throughout Germany and much of Europe. The group dissolved shortly, thereafter, and you took up residence in Triad City. Since that time, some form of a dragon symbol at the scene of various acts of theft, violence, murder and destruction. I would assume that the dragon had something to do with that. VON ZELL You have done your homework, Fraulein. Again, I am impressed. Yes, the dragon has become my symbol, and I used it to relay a symbol to those who cross either my establishment or myself. ClichÃ©, yesâ¦ But old ways are sometimes the best ways, are they not? AJAX Indeed they are. VON ZELL The beautiful thing is that the organizations tied to the council will do their best to keep your handiwork entirely out of the media. Criminal organizations tend to keep matters like this strictly in-house, for fear of embarrassment or possible police investigations into their 'businesses.' Ajax nods. VON ZELL The dragon serves as a message to them that I am greater than any 'Council of Bosses.' That I can send people in to remove their leaders, slaughter their guards, and take whatever I please. That I and I alone, rule Triad City. von Zell smiles smugly to himself. VON ZELL Of course, they will try to exact revenge upon meâ¦ But I am more prepared for such actions than they even realize. I will not be brought down so easily by petty thugs and hoodlums. von Zell laughs softy, but his chortles are soon replaced by a fit of violent coughing. Ajax rises and moves toward him, but Greta holds out a hand to block her. She reaches for a small pitcher of water on a nearby writing desk, and pours a small glass. She offers the glass to von Zell, as well as a small handkerchief. Soon, his coughing subsides. VON ZELL Thank you, Greta. (to Ajax) My apologiesâ¦ My health has not been favorable in recent months. Ajax says nothing. She merely smiles politely. von Zell whispers something into Gretaâs ear. She produces a manilla envelope from the writing desk. VON ZELL I will not beat around the bush, my dear. Here is your assignment, which I will be,,, His words trail off as another coughing fit resumes and he fades out of consciousness. Greta runs to a panel on the wall and presses a combination of buttons on the keypad. Two men dressed in white coats and pushing a stretcher rush in. Greta nods and motions to the unconscious von Zell. Her silent face is marked with panic and dread. The men say nothing, and load von Zell onto the stretcher. They rush back out. Greta hands the envelope to Ajax, who has been watching this all with a look of puzzled curiosity on her face, and escorts her to the door. When she is gone, Greta turns around and goes into a dead sprint towards the stairs. INT. â Bishopâs car â evening Ajax still wears a look of mild puzzlement as she enters the back seat of Bishopâs car. The car begins to drive away. Bishop glances at her in the rear view mirror. BISHOP That was a quick meeting. Are we in? AJAX Yeah, butâ¦ BISHOP But what? AJAX He started coughing really hard and they wheeled him out on the stretcher. After that, I had to go. BISHOP Great. Heâs dead. God damn my luck. I finally find a way to get my foot in the door, and the old geezer kacks it that very night. Fuck meâ¦. AJAX Well, I did get an assignment. She holds up the manila envelope. BISHOP Fat lot of good thatâs gonna do us now, since heâs worm food. Weâre lucky we got paid at all before the old fossil kicked. INT. â Elevator Landing â evening Greta is standing next to the stretcher, carrying the unconscious von Zell. He has an oxygen mask covering much of his ancient fact, and what breathing he does do is quite shallow. She squeezes his hand slightly, and tears roll down her face. The elevator opens and the two med techs roll him in. INT. â Medical Lab â evening The elevator doors roll open and the med techs roll the stretcher to an operating table. A large, four-armed scientist is prepping for surgery. Behind him is a large machine with a huge glass dome set in the middle of the top. Inside the dome is a thick, purple liquid. One of the med techs looks at the scientist with a look of apprehension. MED TECH For the record, I donât think that we should be doing this yet. SCIENTIST Duly noted. Unfortunately, we have no choice in the matter. Orders are orders, and Mr. von Zell specifically told us that we were to initiate the transfer as soon as we were able to. It appears that we have to do it a little sooner than we were prepared for. MED TECH But his body isnât ready yet! The Scientist picks von Zellâs body up and lays him on the operating table. SCIENTIST Itâs functional enough to initiate the transfer. It just hasnât matured as much as I was planning on before this operation was to take place. The med tech looks at him with a slightly panicked look on his face. SCIENTIST Look, if you have any other option, youâre welcome to spill it out. If he comes through, and realizes that we didnât follow his orders specifically, youâre welcome to tell him all about your reservations. If not, then help me get him ready for transferal. The med techs say nothing. They remove von Zellâs robe and shirt. The scientist preps an I.V. and attaches it to von Zellâs arm. A robot lumbers forth, carrying a large device, with a curious headpiece attached to it. Needles attached to wires, which connect back to the device, surround its contours. The med techs plug two long cords into the large machine behind the operating table. The headpiece is placed on von Zellâs head, and fixed to his scalp.

Greta nods and walks over to a seat across the room, where she breaks down into silent sobs. Back at the operating area, the techs strap von Zellâs limp body to the table.

Fading in over his visage are scenes of dark, transparent aspects of his life. All show the full life of a very rich and evil man. Violence, greed, sex, power.

Drive-in Restaurant â Night Bishopâs car is parked in front of a large, garish, neon-sign-laden drive-in restaurant. Both he and Ajax are sitting in the car. INT. Bishopâs car â Night Bishop is munching on a hamburger and gawking at the ass of a waitress who is bending over the car parked next them in the lot. Ajax is pouring over the contents of the manila envelope. AJAX Yâknow, this is really interesting. You should look it over. BISHOP (mouth full of food) Why the hell would I want to look at it? We arenât going to see a red cent from that job, even if we did do it, simply out of charity to the deceased, or some shit. I say burn it, and letâs move on. AJAX I want to do the job, anyway. He was a nice old man and he deserves his last wishes honored. Bishop turns around to face her. He is obviously furious. BISHOP Nice old man?! Do you have any inkling of an idea as to the shit that old geezer has been involved with over the years? (He counts it off on his hands) Robbery, extortion, arson, kidnapping, hijacking, murderâ¦ I could go on and on about this guy. He didnât get filthy rich as he was by being a nice old man, you dimwit. Ajax says nothing. She sits there and ponders the contents of the envelope. Bishop reaches out of the car and slaps the ass of the waitress as she skates by. The waitress promptly turns around and slaps Bishop. WAITRESS Asshole! INT. Apartment â Night Bishop and Ajaxâs apartment is a rathole. Itâs dirty and musty. Plaster has come free of the walls in great chunks, exposing insulation, wiring, etc. Bishop has tried to cover this up by plastering up posters (mostly of rock groups, bikini ladies, and shlocky b-movies) over the patches, but no no avail. Evidently, lodgings were not high on Bishopâs 'to-buy' list, when he received his payment for Ajax, or maybe he simply frittered it all away on meaningless crap. Bishop is asleep on a huge couch across from a large, obviously expensive TV (a sharp contrast the rest of the crap in the room), which displays a test pattern. The clock above the TV reads 3 a.m. Ajax sits in a mismatched chair, reading over the envelopeâs contents, most of which is spread out on a nearby coffee table. Documents, photographs, transcribed telephone conversations. She glances up at the clock, then looks over at Bishop. Quietly, she gathers up the information, stuffs it back into the envelope, and sneaks out of the apartment."
