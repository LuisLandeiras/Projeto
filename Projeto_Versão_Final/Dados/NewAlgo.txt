1. Stylistic and Aesthetic Metrics
Imagery and Descriptive Language: Calculate the frequency of adjectives and adverbs or evaluate the richness of figurative language (e.g., metaphors, similes). A higher usage often correlates with more vivid, beautiful writing.
Alliteration, Assonance, and Consonance: Use a phonetic analysis tool to detect patterns of sound repetition. These can enhance the beauty of text, as seen in poetry or eloquent prose.
Rhythm and Cadence: For longer texts, calculate sentence length variance and punctuation frequency (such as commas and semicolons). Writers often use rhythm for aesthetic impact, particularly in literary texts.

2. Readability and Flow
Readability Variability: While you've already included readability scores, analyze how readability changes across paragraphs or sentences. Texts with a mix of easy and challenging passages can feel more dynamic and engaging. X
Complex syntax (e.g., subordination, coordination) can contribute to textual beauty in sophisticated writing.

3. Emotional Tone and Narrative Quality
Emotion Detection: Go beyond general sentiment analysis to detect specific emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc. Emotional resonance often contributes to both the beauty and the quality of the text. X
Narrative Arc: For longer texts, you can track the emotional highs and lows across the entire text to evaluate its narrative structure. Tools like Sentiment Arc Analysis can show whether the text follows classical narrative structures like Freytag’s Pyramid. X

4. Semantic and Conceptual Measures
Topic Coherence: Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or other topic modeling techniques to assess the coherence of themes in a text. High-quality texts usually maintain consistent thematic threads. X
Conceptual Richness: Evaluate the number of distinct concepts or ideas introduced. Texts that offer a variety of unique ideas may be more intellectually stimulating.
Metaphor and Symbolism Detection: Identify metaphorical language and symbolic patterns. Texts with deep metaphors and symbols are often perceived as more beautiful and thought-provoking.

5. Text Structure
Paragraph and Sentence Transitions: Good writing often uses smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs. Measure the frequency of transitional words/phrases (e.g., "however," "therefore") and the structural coherence between adjacent sentences.
Cohesion and Coherence: Textual cohesion can be calculated using lexical chains, which track how words are semantically related across sentences and paragraphs. Tools like Gensim can help quantify this.

6. Engagement and Style
Pronoun Usage: First-person or second-person pronouns may engage the reader more directly, contributing to subjective beauty, especially in narrative or conversational texts.
Active vs. Passive Voice: Texts that use more active voice tend to feel more engaging. You can calculate the ratio of active to passive sentences.
Use of Dialogue: Dialogue often enhances engagement in narrative texts. Measure the percentage of sentences that are dialogue-based to evaluate this dimension of style.

7. Lexical Sophistication
Word Rarity: Measure the rarity of words using a word frequency database. Texts that use rare or sophisticated vocabulary may be perceived as more beautiful or intellectual. X
Word Paintings: Some tools can detect rare combinations of words that evoke vivid mental images (e.g., "gleaming starlit sky"). These contribute to the beauty of a text.

9. Structural and Thematic Balance
Symmetry and Repetition: Texts that show symmetrical structures or thematic repetition often have a satisfying, well-crafted feel. Analyze repetition of themes, motifs, or certain key phrases.
Progression and Climax: Analyze if the text builds up toward a climax, particularly in literary texts. A well-structured climax can enhance the perceived quality of a narrative.

10. Human-like Style Classifications
NLP Classifiers: Use deep learning models to classify texts based on style (e.g., formal, conversational, poetic). These models can be trained on datasets labeled for "beautiful" or "quality" writing, enabling automated assessments of these dimensions.
GPT-based Analysis: You could use large language models to generate an abstract evaluation of the "beauty" of the text by asking it for a critique or comparison to known literary works.

11. Visual and Sensory Engagement
Sensory Words: Evaluate the frequency of words that appeal to the senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell). Vivid sensory description is often a hallmark of beautiful writing.
Synesthetic Phrases: Identify any use of synesthetic descriptions (e.g., “warm colors” or “loud colors”), where the senses are mixed, often used in poetic or artistic texts.
