"The word surreal is overused and often wrongly used, but in the case of the Washington Post Election Night Live party, the word was apt. First of all, it was a disco. There was a DJ playing a frenetic mix of contemporary Top 40 and pointedly apropos songs such as Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” (“You’re a real tough cookie with a long history   …     ” ). Behind the DJ there were dozens of screens showing various television networks’ coverage of the election. The screens were so bright and so huge, and the colours so primary and vivid, that the experience was like being trapped inside an enormous jar of jelly beans. Women dressed like Vegas showgirls made their way through the crowd with towering tiered hats adorned with chocolates from one of the evening’s sponsors. The chocolates, round and the size of strawberries, were offered in pairs, enclosed in loose plastic sacks  —   a bizarre but perhaps intentionally lewd optic? The bartenders were setting out Campari Americanos by the dozens. The food was by chefs José Andrés and the brothers Voltaggio. The Washington Post has a right to celebrate  —   the paper is thriving and its political coverage extraordinary  —   but this felt like Rome before the fall. At some point early on, the music was turned down for 20 minutes so Karen Attiah of the Post could moderate a live conversation between the current German ambassador, Peter Wittig, and former Mexican ambassador Arturo Sarukhan. The talk was serious and enlightening, but the ambassadors seemed baffled by the nightclub atmosphere, and besides, few people were listening. The party was about the party. And everyone expected Hillary Clinton to win. The attendees were largely Washington insiders  —   lobbyists, staffers, legislative aides, pundits and producers. Most were liberal and most were confident. The night’s only potential for suspense centred around whether or not Clinton would take some of the   states, like Florida and North Carolina. When she was declared the winner  —   which was expected before the party’s scheduled   of 10 o’clock  —   there would be talk of who would be appointed what, with a   portion of the partygoers in line for positions in the new administration. Thus the mood was ebullient at seven o’clock, when the event started, and was electric by eight. Kentucky and Indiana were announced for Donald Trump and that news was met with a shrug. More scantily clad women walked through the rooms serving hors d’oeuvres, and soon there were at least three showgirls wearing hats of towering  . Young Washingtonians swayed to the music. Drinks were set under chairs and spilled. A young girl in a beautiful party dress walked through the drunken partygoers looking for her parents. Then nine o’clock came around and the party began to turn. Most of the states thus far had gone for Trump. None of these victories was unexpected, but the reddening of the national map was disheartening, and the margins in those states were often greater than expected. He took Texas, North Dakota, Kansas, Mississippi. Not a problem for the crowd, but by 9. 30, people were panicking. Trump was leading in Florida and North Carolina. Nate Silver, the statistics shaman who had been roundly criticised for overestimating Trump’s chances, now posted that a Trump victory was likely. Ohio was in the bag, Pennsylvania was trending toward him, and it looked like he could win Wisconsin and Michigan. A hundred guests turned their attention from the big screens to their little screens. They paced and made calls. The party emptied and we all spilled into the streets. Beyond the Washington Post building and beyond DC, the country had been swamped by a white tsunami few saw coming. For a few hours, the city had the feeling of a disaster movie. People scurried this way and that. Some wandered around dazed. Following the returns, we travelled from restaurant to bar to home, and the Somali and Ethiopian cabbies were stunned, worried less about Trump than about the prospect of Rudy Giuliani serving in the cabinet in any capacity. We all talked about where we will move: Belize New Zealand Canada. We no longer knew our own country. In Columbia Heights, when the election was settled, a young woman biking up the hill stopped, threw her bike into the middle of the road, sat on a kerb and began weeping. “No no no no,” she wailed. The omens were there if you looked. A month before the election, I’d driven from Pittsburgh to the Philadelphia suburbs and saw nothing but   signs. In three days I covered about 1, 200 miles of back roads and highway  —   some of the prettiest country you can find on this continent  —   and saw not one sign, large or small, in support of Clinton. The only time any mention of her was made at all was on an enormous billboard bearing her face with a Pinocchio nose. I did see Confederate flags. James Carville, the political strategist, recently quipped that Pennsylvania is Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with Alabama in between, and there is some truth to that. There are a lot of men in camouflage jackets. There are a lot of men out of work. When you stop at gas stations, the magazine sections are overwhelmed by periodicals devoted to guns, hunting and survival. Then there are the tidy farms and rolling hills, the equestrian centres with their white fences, the wide swaths of Amish and Mennonites and Quakers. I was in rural Pennsylvania to see the United 93 National Memorial in Shanksville  —   a monument to the 40 passengers and crew who died in a windswept field on  . The day I visited was bright and clear. The surrounding country was alive with autumn colours and, far on distant ridgelines, white windmills turned slowly. Just off the parking lot, a park ranger in forest green was standing before a diverse group of middle school students, admonishing them. “Boys and girls. Boys and girls,” he said. “You’re standing here where people died. There are still human remains here. You’re goofing around and laughing, and I shouldn’t have to tell you to be respectful. They deserve that. ” They quieted for a moment before one of the boys nudged another, and the giggling began again. The memorial is beautifully constructed and devastating in its emotional punch. Visitors can walk the flightpath of the plane, a gently sloping route down to the crash site, which is separated from the footpath by a low wall. “It’s a grave,” another ranger explained. “So we don’t walk there. ” Higher on the hill, there is an indoor visitor centre that recreates every moment of the day in excruciating detail. There are video loops of the Twin Towers being destroyed, fragments of the plane, pictures and bios of every passenger, details about the calls they made from the plane once they knew they would die. It is shattering. Leaving the museum, a man in front of me, young and built like a weightlifter, couldn’t push the door open. I reached over him to help and he turned to thank me. His face was soaked with tears. I got into my car, shaken but heartened by the courage of the 40 humans who had realised what was happening  —   that they were passengers on a missile headed for the White House or Capitol building  —   and had sacrificed their lives to save untold numbers in Washington DC. The American passengers of United 93 were from 35 different cities in 11 different states, but they died together to save the capital from incalculable loss of lives and what might have been a crippling blow to the nation’s psyche. I left the memorial and turned on to a   road, part of the Lincoln Highway that runs through the state  —  part of the first    highway in the United States. Just beyond a sign advertising   sweetcorn, there was a residential home, the first house anyone might encounter when leaving the United Memorial, and on this home, there is a vast Confederate flag draped over the front porch. It’s important to note that this was the Lincoln Highway. And that the civil war ended 160 years ago. And that Pennsylvania was not a state in the Confederacy. So to see this, an enormous Confederate flag in a Union state, a mile from a symbol of national tragedy and shared sacrifice, was an indicator that there was something very unusual in the mood of the country. Ancient hatreds had resurfaced. Strange alliances had been formed. None of the old rules applied. Steven McManus has come out of the closet twice. First as a gay man, then as a Trump supporter. We were sitting at a coffee shop in Detroit’s Eastern Market neighbourhood, and McManus was almost vibrating. This was two days after Trump’s election, and McManus was elated  —   about the victory, yes, but more personally, about the fact that after Trump’s election, he’d had the courage to post a message on social media declaring his support of the  . “I lived a lot of my life as a closeted guy,” McManus said, “and the liberation I felt as a man coming out was similar to how I felt coming out for Trump. You really truly think you’re the only one who has these feelings. It’s liberating. I felt it was time to come out again. ” McManus is a thin man in his late 30s, bald and bespectacled, with a   beard. He grew up in the part of the Detroit suburbs known as Downriver. Many of the area’s residents had come from the American south in the 1940s to work in the auto factories, and the area still retains a southern feel. His father was a salesman who brokered space on trucking lines. Looking back on it now, McManus appreciated the fact that his parents could raise five children on one salesman’s salary. But then came the Nafta, and the gutting of much of the Detroit auto manufacturing base. McManus watched as Detroit and Flint hollowed out and caved in. “Trump was the only candidate talking about the trade imbalance,” McManus said. “Being a businessman, a successful businessman, he understood why business   at the highest levels of their companies, move their production overseas. ” McManus was angry when auto companies, after receiving bailouts from the US government in 2009, continued to move production to Mexico. “In Detroit, we gave America the middle class. But this is now a false economy. The housing market is decimated, and the middle class is shrinking. I want someone to shake it up. Let’s move the whole country forward. ” McManus is not blind to the rareness of an openly gay man supporting Trump. “But I don’t have to vote a certain way based on my sexuality. In my mind we’ve moved beyond having to vote Democrat just because you’re gay. ” And he’s not worried about a reversal of the   right to marriage gays just achieved. “We’ve got our rights now,” he said. “It’s settled. ” McManus and his husband got married three years ago in New York, before the supreme court decision legalised gay marriage nationwide, and it was in his new place of domestic tranquillity that McManus watched the Republican national convention. Two moments affected him profoundly. First was the appearance of Peter Thiel, the former CEO of PayPal, who was given a prime speaker’s spot and said from the stage, “Every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American. ” McManus was moved then, but he was even more affected by an unscripted part of Trump’s speech. “It was shortly after the Orlando massacre, and for the first time in my life, a Republican candidate for president said things like, ‘  wonderful Americans’ or ‘beautiful Americans’ or whatever he said, ‘were savagely murdered’. And he said, ‘I will protect gay and lesbian individuals.’ Some people at the convention cheered and some people didn’t cheer. And then Trump said, off the cuff and off the teleprompter, he said, ‘For those of you who cheered, I thank you.’ And I cried. I cried. ” McManus’s husband works for the army, as an IT specialist, and they both became bothered by Clinton’s email setup. “If my husband had done the same thing, he’d be fired. And it’s pretty hard to get fired from a government job. ” McManus began to follow Trump more closely, and found that he was agreeing with most of his positions on trade, immigration and national security. “I began to realise that I’m more conservative than I thought. ” But he couldn’t reveal this. He lives in Detroit, a liberal city, and works in the restaurant industry in town, where   politics dominate. But after coming out as a Trump supporter, he is finding himself emboldened. The day after the election, McManus saw his doctor, who is Muslim, and he mentioned that he’d voted for Trump. “I just wanted to get it off my chest. I was feeling a little   …     ” McManus sits up in his chair, to indicate the new confidence he felt that day. “I told him, I came out as a Trump supporter today. And he went off for 15 minutes  —   to the point where I almost walked out. He was impassioned about how he felt that Trump was disenfranchising  . But our present state of terrorism does have a religious undertone to it. Finally I managed to get something off my chest. I can’t remember who said this to me, either my husband or my ex, but I said to my doctor, ‘You know, it wasn’t a group of Catholic nuns that flew planes into the World Trade Center. ’” Later that night in Detroit, I ran into Rob Mickey, a professor of political science. He grew up in Texas, but has spent about 10 years teaching at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. We were at a party benefiting an educational nonprofit. Doing something concrete and positive felt good, and being around kids felt good, but everyone was exhausted  —   no one had slept since the election  —   and 30 seconds into every conversation it turned to Trump, Clinton, what had gone wrong and what would happen next. One of the event’s attendees had been living in a central American cloud forest for years, and there was much talk about following her down there. I told Mickey about McManus, and to him, the story of the gay Trump supporter was both surprising and unsurprising. Everything about 2016 was upside down. Parts of Michigan who had voted twice for Obama had turned to Trump. Rob and his wife Jenny had gone canvassing for Clinton on the Sunday before the election, and the reception they received was not warm. “I would say it was hostile,” he said. They had gone to Milan, Michigan, an overwhelmingly white town 50 miles southwest of Detroit. “It’s spelled like the Italian town, but pronounced ” Rob pointed out. The Clinton campaign had given Rob and Jenny a list of names and addresses of white   residents who had registered as Democrats but were labelled sporadic voters. Milan had voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and winning towns such as Milan was key to delivering a Clinton victory in Michigan. The homes they visited were   with “No Soliciting” placards on every door. They saw no Clinton signs on anyone’s lawn. There were Trump signs scattered around town, but most of the residents they met were disgusted by the entire election. “One woman said, ‘I don’t want to have nothing to do with that,’” Mickey recalled. “Another said, ‘I hate them both, including that guy of yours.’ When I pointed out that our candidate was a woman, she said, ‘Whatever’ and slammed the door. ” One house with a Bernie Sanders sign on the lawn looked promising. Mickey knocked on the door. A white man with a US ARMY shirt answered. He was missing an arm. Mickey introduced himself as a Clinton canvasser, and told the man he had supported Sanders, too, during the primary. “That’s great,” the man said, and closed the door. “The people we met that day were straight out of central casting, if you were making a movie about the disaffected white working class,” Mickey said. “Between 55 and 65, without college degrees. You could see that Lena Dunham and Katy Perry were not going to do anything to form a bridge to these people. If I hadn’t read any polls, and I was basing it just on the people I met, I would have thought, boy, Clinton’s going to get wiped out. ” It was different in 2008. Knowing that Michigan was securely in Obama’s column and Ohio was on the bubble, Rob and Jenny went to Toledo to knock on doors in trailer parks and housing projects. Foreclosure signs were common. When they introduced themselves as canvassers for Obama, the residents, all of them white, were welcoming and chatty. “The interactions were long,” Mickey said. “The people were worried and they wanted to talk. ” Ohio’s 18 electoral votes went to Obama in 2008 and 2012. “This campaign wore a lot of people down,” Mickey said. “The state was bombarded by   ads, but she failed to offer any sustained and coherent economic message. She said, ‘I’m not crazy’ and ‘I’m not a sexist racist pig’ but for working class whites that’s not enough. I would say that of the people who slammed their doors on me, most of them didn’t vote for either candidate. ” In fact, an unprecedented number of Michigan voters cast ballots without choosing either Clinton or Trump. This kind of voting happens every election  —   where voters make their preferences known   but don’t mark anyone for president  —   but never in such numbers. In 2012, there were 50, 000 Michigan voters who declined to choose any presidential candidate. In 2016, there were 110, 000. Clinton lost Michigan by 10, 704 votes. The week after the election, the business of the United States went on. Schools and banks were open. The stock market plummeted and rose to a new high. Commuters commuted, and I was headed from Detroit to Kentucky. All of this was travel planned months before, and none of it had anything to do with the election, but it felt like I was making my way, intentionally, into the heart of Trump country. At Detroit airport it was impossible not to feel the tragedy of Tuesday as having realigned our relationships with each other. Because the voting had split so dramatically along racial lines, how could an   or Latino pass a white person on the street, or at baggage claim, and not wonder, “Which side are you on?” The emergence of safety pins to symbolise support for Clinton (and equality and inclusion) was inevitable  —   it fulfilled a need, particularly on the part of white Americans, to signal where they stand. Otherwise all iconography is subject to misinterpretation. At the airport, I found an older white man staring at me. His eyes narrowed to slits. I was baffled until I realised he was looking at my baseball hat, which bore the logo and name of a Costa Rican beer called Imperial. Was this man a Clinton supporter who suspected me of being a white nationalist? Was the word Imperial sending a Ku Klux   Reich signal to him? Anyway, I was in the wrong terminal. I was in danger of missing a flight to Louisville, so I left and poked my head into a Hertz bus and asked the driver if he would be stopping near Delta anytime soon. He paused for a moment. “Yeah, I’ll take you,” he said. His name was Carl. He was a lanky   man in his 60s, and we rode alone, just me and him in this enormous bus, for a time. He asked how I was doing. I told him I was terrible. I was feeling terrible, but I also wanted him to know which side I was on. He laughed. “Yeah, I was surprised on Tuesday, too,” he said. “But I almost feel sorry for Trump. I don’t think he thought he’d actually win. You see him sitting next to Obama at the Oval Office? He looked like a child. ” In Louisville, three days after the election, I sat with 32 students at Fern Creek high school. This was supposed to be a regular classroom visit by someone passing through, but the atmosphere was different now. The students at Fern Creek are from 28 countries. They speak 41 languages. There are refugees from Syria, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We sat in an oval and ate samosas. Nepalese samosas, I was told. Three of the students in the class were from Nepal, and had a particular recipe. The food was extraordinary. I told these students, three girls still learning English, that I’d always wanted to go to Nepal, and asked them to write down some places they’d recommend. They wrote “Jhapa, Damak (Refugee camp). ” They were from Bhutan and had grown up in a UNHCR camp in eastern Nepal. A young man to my left had come from Iraq two years earlier. Their teachers, Joseph Franzen and Brent Peters, guided the conversation through topics of creativity, social justice and empathy. The students were without exception thoughtful, attentive and respectful of each other’s opinions. Every time a student finished a statement, the rest of the class snapped,   in appreciation. We didn’t talk politics. For the time being, the students had had enough of politics. The day after the election, they’d had a charged discussion about the results, and, still feeling raw, they had written about the discussion the next day. “The thing I didn’t say yesterday was that Muslims scare me. The thing with Isis is out of control and I don’t trust them at all and I don’t get why Mexicans can’t take the test to become legal? Are they lazy?” “The election didn’t really bother me even with the outcome, I didn’t support Trump. The main reason I cared about Clinton winning was ’cause I didn’t want my family to be affected. My mom is gay and married to a woman. ” “As a Muslim female in high school it’s hard to deal with this and let it sink in. But I know Trump doesn’t have full power of his actions. So I feel like even if he’s president, everything will be the same. ” “I was downright disappointed in the country. Because Trump won, racism, sexism, misogyny and xenophobia won. It goes to show what our country values now. Either this is what we value, or this is what the majority is OK with. ” “I feel like everything said yesterday doesn’t even matter anymore. We as American citizens can’t change what’s been decided. Not everybody gets what they want. That’s what life is. Trump will be our new president and we can’t change that. WE need to make America great again, NOT Trump. That’s our job as people. ” “I think Trump and Hillary are both crazy and I’m kind of eager to see how trump runs this    . ” And so we see how differently we express ourselves on paper. The students, sitting in their oval with the smell of Nepalese samosas filling the room, were unfailingly kind to each other. But on paper, other selves were unleashed. Despite the many international students, the school’s population is mostly   48% white and 38% black, and it was easy to see how Trump could bring dormant grievances to the fore, could give licence to reactionary theories and kneejerk assumptions. The students had witnessed eight years of exquisite presidential   and dignity, and now there would be a    man in the White House whose feelings were easily hurt, who called people names, and who tweeted his complaints at all hours, with rampant misspellings and exclamation marks. Our only hope will be that the 100 million or so young people in American schools behave better than the president. A president who has not read a book since he was last required to. Think of it. After the class, a tall   student named Devin approached me. He’d introduced himself before the class, and had asked some very sophisticated questions about using imagery to convey meaning in his poetry. He was a wide receiver on the school’s football team, he said, but he was also a writer. He handed me a   piece of paper, and on it was a   he wanted me to look at. We sat on top of my house, laying back, looking at the stars, the stars shining, waving back at us. They told us hello. Time froze. I turned my head to look at you. Still fixated on the stars, you paid me no mind. I studied you. This was the true face of beauty. Your royal blue eyes, the brown polka dots on your face. Your smile making the moon envious because it could not compare in light. I reached out to grab your hand. You turned your eyes to look at me. Our hands intersected and we both smiled. I told you you were were beautiful. Below the piece, Devin wrote, in red ink, “Do I have something here? Should I continue?” That night in Louisville there was another benefit event, this one for an organisation called Teach Kentucky, which recruits   college graduates to come to the state to teach in the public schools. Joe Franzen and Brent Peters are among Teach Kentucky’s recruits, and if they are any indication of the quality of humans the organisation is attracting, the programme is a runaway success. At the event, Franzen and Peters spoke about their craft, and about making sure their students felt they had a place at the table. There was much talk about their classrooms as families, of meals shared by all, of mutual respect. It was very calm and heartening, but there was also a moment where the audience was encouraged to let out a primal scream (my idea, I admit it) and 200 people did that, screamed, exorcising our   demons. Later on, Jim James  —   Louisville resident and leader of the rock band My Morning Jacket  —   performed a medley of songs, from Leonard Cohen to “All You Need Is Love” and “Blowin in the Wind”. And then everyone got drunk. There was good bourbon. It was called brown water by the locals, and after stomachs were full, we all vacillated between despair and measured hope. But the questions loomed over the night like the shadow of a Nazi zeppelin. Would he really try to build a wall? Would he really try to exclude all Muslims? Would he actually appoint a white nationalist as his chief of staff? And did 42% of American women really vote for a man who threatened to overturn Roe v Wade and who bragged about grabbing them by the pussy? Did the white working class really elect a man whose most famous catchphrase was “You’re fired”? Like a teenager with poor   the American people had chosen the flashy and abusive boyfriend over the steady, boring one. We’ve had enough decency for one decade, the electorate decided. Give us chaos. It is not easy to get a ticket to Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. This is the newest museum on the National Mall in Washington, DC, and its design, by the   architect David Adjaye, is so successful, at once immediately iconic and bold but also somehow blending into the   surrounding architecture, that it has become the most   building in the United States. Admission is free, but there is a   wait for passes, and the passes are timed. If you get a pass, you must enter at the assigned hour or wait another six months. I had gotten such a timed pass, and it so happened that the pass was for the day after the election. That morning, I had the choice between staying in bed, forgoing my one chance at seeing the building in 2016, or rising on three hours’ sleep and keeping the appointment. Like millions of others, I did not want the day to begin. If I woke up, I would check the news, and if I checked the news, there would be confirmation of what I had remembered foggily from the night before  —   that the people of America had elected a reality television host as their president. I closed my eyes, wanting sleep. Then I remembered the Gazans. Back in April, I had been in the Gaza Strip and had met a married couple, Mahmoud and Miriam, journalists and activists who badly wanted to leave Gaza. I had   them to an asylum lawyer in San Francisco, but from 7, 000 miles away, she couldn’t do much to help. The impossible thing was that they actually had a visa. A real visa issued by the American state department. All they had to do was get out of Gaza. But permissions were needed from the Israelis or Egyptians, and they were having no luck with either. Finally, one day in October, an email arrived. Mahmoud and Miriam were in Brooklyn. They’d bribed an Egyptian guard at the Rafah gate and had made their way on a 14‑hour journey through Sinai. So on a lark I told them to meet me in DC. Frederick Douglass had said, after all, that every American should visit the nation’s capital at least once. And given they would soon be Americans, wouldn’t it be good to do that duty right away, and do it the day after the first woman had been elected president? (We had made the plans a week before.) So they had planned to meet me at this museum celebrating   history in the shadow of the obelisk dedicated to George Washington, great man and also slaveowner. The morning was clear and cool. A small line had formed outside the museum before the doors were to open. I looked around, and didn’t see them. Then I did. They were aglow. They’d spent their lives in an   prison of 141 square miles, and now they were here. They could move about freely, could decide one day to go to the capital of the United States and be there a few hours later. No checkpoints, no bribes, no Hamas secret police. I’d seen Miriam suffer in Gaza because she refused to wear the hijab and favoured western clothes. In Gaza City, she was yelled at, cursed. “I hope your parents are proud!” people yelled to her. Now she was herself, uncovered, dressing as she chose. Her smile was incandescent. “I’m so sorry,” I said. I was apologising for what we’d done the day before. Electing the man who wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the country. The man who might bring Giuliani into a seat of unspeakable power. This could mean terrible things for Palestinians. There was already talk of the end of the   solution. Netanyahu, it was assumed, had danced all night. “It’s OK,” they said. They handed me a gift. It was a piece of the Gaza City airport. The airport had been destroyed by Israel in 2002. The piece they’d brought me was tiled it looked like part of the airport bathroom. I thanked them, put the chunk of concrete in my bag, and we wondered aloud whether the security check at the museum would object to the entry of a shard of Gazan airport. We passed through the doors, and I was allowed to keep my bag with me, so we three, and part of the Gaza City airport, made our way through the museum’s halls. It was glorious of course, and altogether too much to take in in one day. We ate in the basement cafeteria, and talked about what was next. They would need an asylum lawyer, and fast. Ninety days, and then anything could happen. “Don’t worry,” Mahmoud said. The Gazan asylum seekers were telling me not to worry. But I was worried. Worried enough to change their names in this piece. They aren’t Mahmoud and Miriam. We are entering an era where uniquely vindictive men will have uniquely awesome power. Dark forces have already been unleashed and terrible plans are being made. On 3 December, the Ku Klux Klan are holding their largest public rally in years, to celebrate Trump’s victory, which they claim as their own. I also changed Steven McManus’s name. I worried for him, as well. You should be worried, too. George W Bush, a man of comparative calm and measured intellect, started two foreign wars and cratered the world economy. Trump is far more reckless. We are speeding toward a dark corridor, my friends. Keep your eyes open, your hearts stout and be ready for the fight."
"Until Mark Zuckerberg arrived in a bright orange helicopter in October 2014, Chandauli had never seen a celebrity visitor. One of 44, 795 villages in the state of Rajasthan, Chandauli is only three or four hours’ drive from Delhi, but it exists alone and forgotten, tucked away, a kilometre off a quiet highway. Last year, when a local boy used the internet to buy a used motorcycle, astonished villagers called him an online shopping hero. Zuckerberg had come to see an experiment at work. Earlier that year, with its sights set on the forthcoming elections, the government had asked a foundation to help give Chandauli’s mostly Muslim villagers a digital education. And so, with uncommon haste, a small administrative building was turned into a community centre, where locals could learn how to access email and find information online. Soon, almost every household in the village had one person who knew how to use a computer. The digital transformation of Chandauli was an ideal story for Zuckerberg  —   a little parable for his grand mission for India. He wanted to bring the internet to millions of people who had never used it before. Specifically, he wanted to bring them a version of the internet that had Facebook at its core. After Zuckerberg landed, he was quickly guided by his advisers towards the community centre. He saw wheat fields and power lines, and a classroom with children sitting on a dirt floor. The heat warped the horizon. A crowd trailed behind him, talking excitedly about the man they called “Juckerberg”. But once he stepped inside the centre, the door was closed and latched. Zuckerberg took a seat on a plastic stool, and awkwardly asked the village children about how they used the centre’s computers. His stiff manner, combined with the presence of a reporter from Time magazine, and a Facebook photographer documenting the encounter, added to the sensation that the locals were playing parts in a performance directed by the company. But not everything went according to plan. The electricity had gone out shortly after Zuckerberg arrived, taking with it the wireless network that provided the village’s main connection to the internet. Instead, one of the boys showed Zuckerberg his mobile phone, and tried to bring up his Facebook profile page. This roused the CEO. “He genuinely wanted to know what they did on their phones, and how they spent time on the internet,” said Osama Manzar, the   of the Digital Empowerment Foundation that had set up Chandauli’s digital literacy centre. Under Zuckerberg’s gaze, the boy’s profile page slowly emerged on a 2G connection. “Bandwidth issues,” Zuckerberg said to himself. He assured the children inside, and the villagers outside, that their connectivity problems would be fixed before his next visit. Later that day, Zuckerberg returned to New Delhi, where he posted a picture of himself speaking with a child at the resource centre. “Seeing   how people here are using the internet was an incredible experience,” he wrote. “One day, if we can connect every village, we can transform many more lives and improve the world for all of us. Chandauli is just the start. ” From Zuckerberg’s vantage point, high above the connected world he had helped create, India was a largely blank map. Many of its citizens  —   hundreds of millions of people  —   were clueless about the internet’s powers. If only they could see how easily they could form a community, how quickly they could turn into buyers and sellers of anything, how effortlessly they could find anything they needed  —   and so much more that they didn’t. Zuckerberg was convinced that Facebook could win them over, and even more convinced that this would change their lives for the better. He would bring India’s rural poor online quickly, and in great numbers, with an irresistible proposition: users would pay nothing at all to access a version of the internet curated by Facebook. But where Zuckerberg saw the endless promise of a digital future, Indians came to see something more sinister. Seventeen months later, Facebook’s grand plans to bring India online had been halted by overwhelming local opposition  —   the biggest stumbling block the company had hit in its   . In the end, it seemed, Facebook had acted as if it was giving India a gift. But it was not a gift Indians wanted. In the charged days before Facebook went public in May 2012, its official filings contained a faint warning about the company’s future growth. In Europe and America, the company had gained users at an astonishing rate  —   but, as it ran out of new people to add, its expansion was slowing. On both continents, almost four out of five people had internet access, and more than half of them were already on Facebook. In the rest of the world, Facebook’s business was booming, but it had the opposite problem: less than half the population was connected to the internet. For the social network to continue its astronomical growth, it needed those people to get online. No country except China held the kind of potential that India did  —   and Facebook was banned in China. Without much effort, there were already around 100 million Facebook users in India by 2014, and the company judged its potential market to be several hundred million more. “If you look at the literate population, which is a good proxy for how many people can be online, it’s about   million,” a Facebook employee who worked on the company’s plans for India told me. “That’s really the opportunity. If you rank countries based on opportunity, India comes out on top, and comes out on top by a big margin. ” According to a Facebook executive, the company’s internal analysis projected that more than 30% of the new customers it hoped to add worldwide by 2020 would come from India. But Facebook was not about to sit around waiting for them to get online on their own. Since 2010, the company had been experimenting with ways to bring more people online, and thus to Facebook. One of these experiments, the Facebook employee said, was a project referred to as Apollo. Under Apollo, Facebook’s growth and partnership teams persuaded mobile phone companies in the Philippines, Latin America, Africa and India to give mobile phone users who had not paid for data plans free access to Facebook. The initial financial sacrifice, Facebook told the phone companies, was an investment  —   giving customers a small taste of the internet would convince them to start paying to access everything the web had to offer. The best proof of this proposition came in the Philippines, where Facebook partnered with Globe  —   the smaller of the country’s two dominant mobile companies  —   which trailed its rival’s market share by 20 percentage points. Globe’s user numbers surged, and within 15 months, it had overtaken its rival, thanks to the enormous lure of free access to Facebook. “It all started with the free Facebook promo,” one Filipino stock analyst told a local business newspaper. The success of such experiments fed into a much bigger plan Facebook had been developing: an ambitious effort to bring hundreds of millions of people around the world online. In February 2014, while the results of the Philippines experiment were trickling in, Zuckerberg stood on a stage at a mobile industry conference in Barcelona and pitched the phone companies its big plan: Internet. org, which would provide free basic internet services to entice the whole world online. The phone companies would foot the bill, but Zuckerberg laid out the economic benefits of helping the world’s poor to join the digital age: “There was this Deloitte study that came out the other day,” he told his audience, “that said if you could connect everyone in emerging markets, you could create more than 100 million jobs and bring a lot of people out of poverty. ” The Deloitte study, which did indeed say this, was commissioned by Facebook, based on data provided by Facebook, and was about Facebook. In July 2014, Zambia became the first country where Internet. org was rolled out. But Facebook was already preparing for India. A few months before Zuckerberg’s helicopter landed in Chandauli, Facebook contacted Osama Manzar of the Digital Empowerment Foundation to ask for his advice on tailoring Internet. org to a local audience. Manzar is stocky, with a face that expresses delight instantly. In a room full of dark suits, he is the guy wearing the white kurta and the patterned turban. For months, Facebook employees working on Internet. org mined Manzar for information. “Just about anybody from Facebook in the US would land up at our office,” he told me. Facebook staff emailed and phoned him. “They had questions interns would have!” Manzar likes to say he guided them like a paid adviser, but without the pay. “It was taking a lot out of me, and I had no idea what the future of this huge amount of   was,” he told me. Manzar, who is 48, had spent much of his life working to help Indians get online, and now one of the biggest tech companies in the world had thrown its weight behind his cause. “The power of Facebook as a platform, how it has motivated people to come online, generate content, get even the   to become literate . .. I am a great fan,” he said. But Manzar’s optimism soured when he saw what Internet. org actually looked like: a threadbare platform that only allowed access to 36 bookmarked sites and Facebook, which was naturally the only social network available. There was one weather app, three sites for women’s issues, and the search engine Bing. Facebook’s   internet was reminiscent of old search engines that listed the early web on one page, when it was small enough to be categorised, like books in a library. Crucially, Facebook itself would decide which sites were included on the platform. The company had positioned Internet. org as a philanthropic endeavour  —   backed by Zuckerberg’s lofty pronouncements that “connectivity is a human right”  —   but retained total control of the platform. “Their pitch about access turned into mobilisation for their own product,” Manzar said. Manzar had never seen anything like it. He realised that if Internet. org took hold in India, Facebook would be the gatekeeper to the web for hundreds of millions who had no idea what the internet was, or what it could do for them. As Zuckerberg travelled around the country in the autumn of 2014, he had every reason to be optimistic about Facebook’s India strategy. He received an ecstatically warm welcome from Indian politicians, who were eager to advertise their   by being seen with Facebook’s founder. He was even granted an audience with India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, who had built a sizeable online presence  —   with some help from Facebook  —   during the recent elections. The prime minister spoke with Zuckerberg about his “Clean India” mission  —   which encouraged citizens to tidy up their streets and towns  —   and Zuckerberg said Facebook would create an app for the programme. (This promise was widely reported, but the app never materialised. When employees inquired about it later, a senior Facebook policy director said that making the app would violate Facebook’s   policies, according to documentation I was shown.) Zuckerberg also got an easy ride from the Indian media, which churned out puff pieces about Facebook’s noble plans to get millions of Indians online. But the company remained vague about the detailed workings of Internet. org, and tech journalists began to voice their suspicions after an evasive press conference in New Delhi, where Zuckerberg only took questions from carefully selected reporters. One of the sceptics was Nikhil Pahwa, the founder and editor of Medianama, a news site about India’s telecommunications industry, who left the press conference and began to outline his reservations about what Facebook was proposing. “What Zuckerberg means by internet for all, is essentially Facebook for all, along with a few   services thrown in to give it the appearance of philanthropy,” he wrote the following day. But what would prove devastating to Zuckerberg’s ambitions for India was something else that Pahwa noticed. Facebook had wandered into an arcane technical dispute  —   involving India’s phone companies and the idea of net neutrality  —   which was about to come to a boil. Internet. org would allow some commercial services  —   such as the employment site Babajob  —   to be available on its free platform. But that would necessarily mean excluding those companies’ competitors, and essentially subsidising the growth of a few chosen firms. Pahwa argued that this arrangement violated net neutrality  —   the principle that phone companies and internet providers should not be allowed to prioritise certain sites and services, since this could fundamentally alter the level playing field of the internet. The government had been debating the legality of services said to violate net neutrality. If it decided to issue a ruling on the subject, Facebook’s plans could be dashed. Medianama, Pahwa’s website, was not widely read outside of the telecoms industry, but he was a respected voice in the field, and Facebook was sufficiently concerned about his criticism that the company invited him for a meeting in January 2015. Two senior officials were in the office: Ankhi Das, Facebook’s head of public policy in India, and Kevin Martin, the former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, who was working as a consultant for the company. Pahwa was unwilling to speak about the meeting (“It was off the record,” he explained) but he said that “the sense I had was that Facebook was trying to understand how much I knew about Internet. org”. In February 2015, four months after Zuckerberg’s visit, Internet. org went live in India, in partnership with Reliance Mobile, India’s   phone company. (Several other operators declined, the Facebook employee told me, because they were already worried about the issue of net neutrality.) Reliance’s advertisements for the service showed college students crowding around a single phone, laughing at something on the screen. The tagline: “If the sun is free   …     If the air is free   …     Then why shouldn’t the internet be free?” For a brief moment, it felt like a routine product launch  —   except for continued complaints from a small number of critics. Facebook responded to criticism by claiming that 40% of users were purchasing full data plans within a month  —   joining the full internet, in other words  —   but the critics fired back that as Facebook refused to provide further details these numbers could not be verified. The debate between the company and its critics about the virtues of Internet. org would most likely have carried on quietly, without ever disturbing the attention of ordinary Indians. But at the end of March 2015, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announced that it was considering a ruling on net neutrality, and asked for public comment on the issue. Any ruling would affect the fate of Internet. org. For Pahwa, this was a worrying development. Even the term “net neutrality” was forbidding: “It’s a terrible, technical sounding phrase,” he said. The TRAI already seemed to have a tendency to come down on the side of the phone companies, and Pahwa believed his only chance of winning was to somehow gather huge public support. The regulator could ignore policy papers by telecom nerds. “What they can’t ignore is people,” Pahwa emailed a friend. Luckily, at least in the public eye, his adversary was one of the world’s largest and most famous technology companies  —   and the playing field was a country whose citizens reacted with fierce antipathy to anything that looked like a foreign power dictating terms to grateful supplicants. Pahwa fired off emails to several acquaintances, explaining that he felt the future of India’s internet was at stake. “People don’t realise what’s going on until it has happened,” he said. A group of volunteers  —   coders, lawyers, policy wonks  —   began to coalesce around Pahwa. Dubbing their movement Save the Internet, they built a website that would allow anyone to make a submission to the regulator in favour of net neutrality. On 11 April, the website launched, featuring a video by a wildly popular group of young comedians, All India Bakchod  —   who produced a   net neutrality explainer that would eventually rack up 3. 5 million views. Within two weeks, more than a million people had used the site to send emails to the government  —   and soon enough, politicians were debating net neutrality in parliament. All of a sudden, a shockingly large number of Indians had been drawn into a loud and raucous public argument about the intricacies of the country’s telecoms policy. On one side, there was the unlikely sight of a popular online rebellion, among young and old alike, in favour of net neutrality  —   a concept almost nobody had heard of a few months earlier. On the other side were the phone companies and Facebook, which was convinced that its plans would benefit the economy, lure a massive invisible population online, and help realise India’s ambitions to become a digital powerhouse. This side was not without its own impassioned supporters, and soon India’s fractious social media was tangled in thousands of bitter fights about whether Facebook was asking too much for the kind of progress it promised to provide. On Twitter, supporters of net neutrality began to protest against companies that had partnered with Facebook. Before long, four websites withdrew their participation, and tweeted support for net neutrality on their way out. All the while, from his office at Facebook HQ in Silicon Valley, Chris Daniels, the   of Internet. org, watched with alarm as the opposition mounted in India. In particular, I was told by a person close to Daniels, the popularity of All India Bakchod’s video worried Facebook’s top brass. The company’s most senior leaders in India scrambled to assemble a response: according to a Facebook employee, their only idea was to “address myths” about Internet. org and “educate” policymakers about the platform. “Just answering their questions was the strategy,” the employee recalled. To most onlookers, Facebook’s initial reaction suggested that the company was not taking the opposition seriously. Its efforts appeared clumsy and ineffective, especially for a company that rarely stumbles so visibly. Employees wondered what Facebook’s gameplan was. “To do things right, you need someone in policy who is a strategist and a skilful tactician,” the Facebook employee said. “Globally, yes, we have people like that. In India I’m not so sure. ” In private, Facebook’s efforts began to intensify. Zuckerberg began to make personal calls to Indian internet entrepreneurs to rebuild support for Internet. org. One person he contacted was a former senior executive of NASSCOM, India’s software industry lobby. The senior executive told Zuckerberg that he would support Internet. org  —   but only if Facebook opened up the platform to any company that wanted to participate. Zuckerberg promised him Facebook would make this change in the future. “Can we have your support now?” the executive recalled Zuckerberg asking. “We’ll make it a feature in Internet. org 2. 0. ” Over the course of 2015, Facebook executives repeatedly met with lawmakers and the government’s regulators, who gave no indication when they would issue any decision on net neutrality. (In response to my questions, a Facebook spokesperson said the company had met with the chairman of India’s telecoms regulator to discuss “a range of connectivity issues”.) Daniels, the Internet. org   made about six trips to India in 2015 to meet with policymakers, the Facebook employee recalled: “Those meetings were like a rollercoaster. Sometimes it would feel like lawmakers and regulators understood what Facebook was trying to do with Internet. org, and in some meetings somebody would make it sound like we would get shut down tomorrow. ” Facebook held its cards close, and tried to avoid public confrontation. At one parliamentary committee hearing, the company took the unusual step of asking if it could put its case to lawmakers in private, and had everyone else cleared out of the room. Ankhi Das, the company’s head of public policy  —   its top lobbyist, in other words  —   had uncommonly good access in Delhi’s corridors of power. Her presence seemed to open any door, a Facebook executive told me. “We used to joke that it was like she was Modi’s granddaughter. ” Modi had swept into office after a massive election victory in May 2014, thanks in part to a huge,   online following. The person who ran Modi’s social media operation told me that Facebook was extraordinarily responsive to requests from the campaign, and recalled that Das “never said no” to any information the campaign wanted. However, a Facebook spokesperson insisted that the company had never provided special information or extra details to Modi’s campaign. In the months after the election, Facebook’s interest in India was evident. Sheryl Sandberg met Modi soon after. A few months later, Zuckerberg paid him a visit. And in the midst of the net neutrality debate, Modi returned the favour by making an appearance before a large crowd at Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters in September 2015, with Zuckerberg and Sandberg at his side. The moment  —   a picture of solidarity  —   was broadcast live online, and did not go unnoticed back in India, where it was covered live on television. Pahwa, who had been invited into a TV studio to give his reaction, recalled that he feared Modi would announce his opposition to net neutrality on the spot. Instead, Zuckerberg told Modi a cute story. “I haven’t told this publicly,” he began, anxiously. “Before things were going well, when people wanted to buy Facebook, I met my mentor, Steve Jobs. ” The Apple CEO apparently urged Zuckerberg to visit a temple in India that he had gone to years earlier. “So I travelled for almost a month, seeing how people connected,” said Zuckerberg. “Having the opportunity to feel how much better the world could be if everyone had a stronger ability to connect reinforced for me the importance of what we were doing. That’s something I’ve always remembered while we built Facebook. ” Modi clapped and grinned. A month after Modi’s visit to Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg returned to Delhi once again. At the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, Zuckerberg sauntered on to a stage and gave woolly answers to the softest of   questions. But when the talk ended, Zuckerberg was ushered to a nearby room, where many of India’s most prominent online entrepreneurs had been assembled for a   meeting with him. By now Internet. org had been rechristened Free Basics. The meeting was about how Facebook could help everyone there, one of the attendees recalled. However, the entrepreneurs wanted to talk about Free Basics. “Everybody started saying, ‘Well, why are you controlling who gets on this? ’” recalled Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the proprietor of the popular mobile payments firm Paytm. Zuckerberg assured them that Facebook would no longer retain the power to choose which sites were included. “He said he will not decide who will be on Free Basics. Some ‘eminent people’ of India will decide,” Sharma said. The entrepreneurs wanted Free Basics changed in many ways, and Sharma recalled Zuckerberg’s response as being, “I’ve heard your inputs, and we’ll try changing it. ” When it was Sharma’s turn to speak, he did not hide his feelings. “I said, ‘Zuck, what are you talking about?’ In my view, it’s like the British coming in and saying, ‘While everything’s OK, we’ll come in and help you with your tax collection  —   and this is the percentage we’ll take.’ It’s incredible. ” Several people involved in the debate over net neutrality shared Sharma’s disbelief. They told me that Facebook’s insistence on pushing through Free Basics without a transparent discussion was doing lasting damage to the company. “There was   in the people who carried out the campaign,” Nitin Pai, the   of an influential policy thinktank named the Takshashila Institution, told me. “You know that foreigners talking down to Indians and telling them what is good for them is going to backfire. ” Zuckerberg had tried to gain Sharma’s support. An endorsement by the boss of Paytm  —   one of India’s entrepreneurship success stories  —   would have been a signal to other companies to sign on, said the former NASSCOM executive. But Sharma had been consistent in his opposition to platforms like Free Basics. “What is my perception of Facebook’s purpose? Thumbs up,” Sharma said when we met earlier this year at his office. “What is my judgment of their actions? It’s not correct. The purpose is nice. I want everybody in this country to be connected as much as Zuck wants. Who doesn’t want that? But are they doing it correctly?” He could not stop laughing as he imagined Facebook’s plans to serve India. “Someone isn’t advising them well. Let them provide the complete internet for free at night. We’ll partner with them,” he said, thumping his chest. Within Facebook, the executive said, there existed a strong belief that the crises would pass the regulator would eventually be pressed to give services such as Free Basics legal sanction and that would end the debate. After months of   the telecoms regulator  —   under the influence of a new chairman  —   decided in November 2015 to hurry up and reach a decision on net neutrality. For the second time in a year, it asked the public to comment, on three specific questions relating to net neutrality and expanding internet access, with a deadline of 30 December. There was no mention of Facebook or Free Basics. “Facebook did not figure much in the discussions,” a person involved in the telecoms regulator’s deliberations said. Instead, the regulator turned the debate’s glare away from Facebook, and on to the larger subject of net neutrality. By resolving the larger issue, they thought, the Free Basics question would sort itself out. But Facebook panicked. The company saw the regulator’s public questions as an existential threat, and within a week, Facebook’s marketing and policy teams launched a   campaign to rally support. Every user in India who logged into Facebook was greeted with a special message from Facebook, which said: “Free Basics is a first step to connecting 1 billion Indians to the opportunities online. But without your support, it could be banned in a matter of weeks. ” Below the message, a large purple button invited users to click and “send email” to the regulator. If this was not intrusive enough, many users complained that even if they declined to send the message, merely lingering on the page caused Facebook to send all their friends a notification indicating they had written to the regulator. Online, outrage at the   tactics erupted. “FB just listed an uncle’s account as having signed up to support Free Basics,” one user tweeted. “He passed away two years ago. ” Facebook had succeeded, overwhelmingly, in making the larger ruling on net neutrality about itself. As Pahwa told me: “Facebook came and shoved its ass in our faces. ” Commuters on India’s roads and highways found themselves called upon to support Free Basics from what seemed like thousands of billboards. One pictured a farmer and his family and asked them to support “a better future” for unconnected Indians such as “Ganesh” who used Free Basics and learned “new farming techniques that doubled his crop yield”. Patriotic Facebook advertisements filled entire pages in Indian newspapers every day. By the end of the year, the Indian business daily Mint reported that Facebook had spent more than £30m on advertising. “It felt like a tidal wave,” Pahwa recalled. Two days before the deadline set by the regulator, an editorial by Zuckerberg was published in the Times of India, the country’s largest newspaper. “Critics of free basic internet services should remember that everything we’re doing is about serving people like Ganesh,” he wrote, in reference to the farmer who had featured in Facebook’s ad campaign. Pahwa responded with an   of his own in the same paper. Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg made one final offer to India’s software industry. NASSCOM, the software lobby, had come out for net neutrality earlier in the year. But now, days before the deadline, its members were abuzz about the deal Zuckerberg had proposed  —   the lobby group itself would hold the power to decide which sites were on Facebook’s platform. “That suddenly made them say, ‘Man, that would put us in a very powerful position,’” the former NASSCOM executive told me. The software lobby quietly changed its tune: it told the regulator it supported net neutrality, with an exception for “  business promotions”  —   like Free Basics. According to Facebook, 16 million users in India sent messages to the regulator to support Free Basics before the deadline. Swamped with feedback, the regulator used   programs to sift out the original replies. A pattern emerged immediately the comments in support of Free Basics that Facebook had submitted did not address the questions the regulators had asked. The regulator worried that Free Basics’ supporters were not “making informed decisions” and chastised Facebook for reducing the consultation to a popularity contest. The regulator spent the month of January 2016 preparing its ruling. The meetings ran on for hours every day. But the discussions were about the details of a stance that had already been decided: net neutrality would be upheld. “We could have kept going on discussing it, but someone has got to stop,” a person closely involved in the process said. “So we just stopped on 8 February. ” Services such as Free Basics were effectively declared illegal. Many of Facebook’s supporters  —   in India and abroad  —   were aghast: why would a poor country reject the assistance of one of the world’s biggest and most powerful tech companies? Marc Andreessen, the powerful venture capitalist who sits on Facebook’s board, contemptuously suggested a misguided resentment of the west was to blame. “  has been economically catastrophic for India for decades,” he told his 500, 000 Twitter followers. “Why stop now?” When I mentioned this quote to the Facebook executive, he raised his voice in frustration. “There’s no respect, and you can see that from Marc Andreessen. They wouldn’t dare to say that about China. In India they’re fine because we’ve been bending over backwards to accommodate them. I’m a supporter of prime minister Modi, but I don’t know why he has let this go on. ” He bet me that Andreessen would apologise by the end of the next day. As we spoke, Andreessen tweeted an apology. Senior people at Facebook, the executive said, had convinced themselves they had special pull with the prime minister. “They believed Modi would do it for them,” he said, recalling meetings where people discussed the similarities in “managing” India and Africa: “It worked in Burundi, so it should work in India. ” “I think the mistake that people make is that they think, ‘India is this developing country and there are these   ways of getting things done,’” the Facebook employee told me. “In essence, the mistake of thinking that a   country is a banana republic. So institutions, the public, the press  —   they can be bypassed. ” He recalled a whiff of disrespect that lingered in meeting rooms and on conference calls. “You can sense it in the way that some of these things have been approached. It’s like, ‘If we show support for Free Basics from six million users, the government can’t shut it down’. ” “We are not a Tanzania,” Pai, the thinktank founder, said. “We are producing apps, and it is an economic pillar to our success. So we shouldn’t give over our keys to anyone. We should be careful of putting market power in the hands of one or two companies. ” Several people who had been lobbied by Facebook  —   and a few insiders at the company  —   remarked with distaste that the company had “no skin in the game” as one put it. “The pipes belong to the phone companies, and they pay the marketing costs of bringing new users online,” the former NASSCOM executive said. “So what exactly did Facebook bring here?” When I asked the Facebook executive why the company had failed to heed the growing protests and carried on fighting so hard for Free Basics, he pointed to Zuckerberg’s intense belief in Facebook’s mission. “This happens every time Facebook pushes out a new change,” he said. “New privacy settings? People protest, Facebook changes it just a little, and people get used to it. The same thing probably happened here. Mark would have thought people would get used to it. ” In the months after the ruling, Facebook went quiet in India. The company’s managing director there was transferred, and there were murmurs within Facebook that a new person was being hired to head up Free Basics in India. But the bustle and combativeness of the previous year was gone. The company seemed to be turning its attention to China. In March, Zuckerberg was photographed on a jog in Beijing, where he was mocked online for declining to wear a face mask in deference to his hosts, despite the smog. The next day, Zuckerberg  —   who has been brushing up on his Mandarin  —   had a meeting with China’s propaganda chief, Liu Yunshan. According to official reports in the local media, the Facebook founder vowed he would work with Chinese peers to “build a better world in cyberspace”. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."
"Paul Doyle Riyad Mahrez. Dominic Fifield You could take your pick from Jamie Vardy, N’Golo Kanté or Riyad Mahrez at Leicester but Mahrez gets my vote on the basis he offered invention and creation as well as goals from wide. It is astonishing to think he cost only a   fee when plucked from Le Havre in 2014. Owen Gibson Take your pick from any of those who worked miracles at the King Power but Kanté was the choice of those very players for good reason. Won more tackles and made more interceptions than any other player in the Premier League.  Barry Glendenning Kanté has been a revelation for Leicester. “No matter who we’re playing, we play three in midfield  —   Drinkwater in the middle and Kanté either side,” explained the club’s chief scout, Steve Walsh, in a fairly unbeatable description that tells us all we need to know. Andy Hunter Mahrez. 17 goals, 11 assists, glorious footwork and vision illuminated Leicester en route to the title but the Algerian’s character, which helped eke out several slender but crucial victories, completed the package. David Hytner Vardy. When I read last December that they were thinking about making a Hollywood movie out of his   I thought it might be a bit much. Now, it seems like the most obvious thing in the world. Jamie Jackson Wes Morgan. A supposed career journeyman who led Leicester with a coolness and assurance that will come to be viewed as one of the great feats of captaincy. Stuart James I’m giving it to Vardy for his all round contribution  —   24 goals, six assists, and breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record. Amy Lawrence Mahrez. Of all the outstanding candidates from Leicester, he was the one who could make the crowd gasp with pure, creative technique. Scott Murray Virgil van Dijk. At some point, the penny will drop and a club other than Southampton will have a quick gander around the Scottish league. Sachin Nakrani Mahrez. His high point was the   nutmeg on Stoke’s Philipp Wollscheid which, four months on, continues to feel like a trick of the mind. Barney Ronay Vardy. The romantic choice but also an entirely sensible one. Both a nerveless goalscorer and the hare that made an entire team run behind him. Jacob Steinberg It feels harsh in the extreme to overlook Vardy’s goals and assists but I’m going to, simply because few things in life are better than watching an impish winger like Mahrez torment  .  Daniel Taylor Mahrez, with an honourable mention for Wes Morgan, who has come a long way since being part of the Nottingham Forest defence that sieved five to Yeovil Town in the League One  . Louise Taylor Mahrez. Although hats off to Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City for creating the right framework for him to strut his wonderful stuff. It would be very interesting to see how Mahrez might fare in a Tony Pulis or Alan Pardew team  —   what price he would have disappeared without trace or received the Hatem Ben Arfa treatment?  Paul Wilson I voted for Vardy as footballer of the year. If you cannot get recognition for climbing out of   football to win the title, break Van Nistelrooy’s Premier League scoring record and banging in the probable goal of the season against Liverpool what is the point of having an award?  Paul Doyle Claudio Ranieri. As José Mourinho meant to say once “Ranieri doesn’t need (more money than anyone else and a poisonous attitude) to win”. Dominic Fifield Ranieri. Clearly. And yes, I was one of the doubters who presumed he would be the first coach to be sacked. Owen Gibson Ranieri: his status as the most universally popular man to ever win the title may have obscured just how remarkable his blend of tactical nous and instinctive grasp of group psychology was.  Barry Glendenning Ranieri, obviously. A tip of the hat also to Eddie Howe and Slaven Bilic, whose good work at Bournemouth and West Ham respectively has been rather overshadowed. Andy Hunter Ranieri. Tweaked his approach to suit the players at his disposal, handled what everyone on the outside called mounting pressure with ease and good humour, tactically superb and a worthy champion. David Hytner Ranieri. No explanation necessary. Jamie Jackson Ranieri. A lovely man, too. Stuart James Ranieri. Not only did Ranieri do an extraordinary job with Leicester, he handled himself with dignity, humility and class throughout. Success could not happen to a nicer man. But be warned, Claudio, I nominated Garry Monk for this award last year   …     Amy Lawrence Dilly ding, dilly dong all the way. Every single thing Ranieri has done all season has been magnifico. Scott Murray Sam Allardyce masterminded yet another outrageous Sunderland escape against all the odds, the Harry Houdini and Dick Advocaat de nos jours. Poor Rafa, though. Sachin Nakrani Ranieri. “Veni, vidi, vici,” as they might say in Ranieri’s native Rome. Barney Ronay Ranieri, obviously, with honourable mentions for Mauricio Pochettino’s running game, Howe’s excellence and the enduring Bigness of Sam. Jacob Steinberg Ranieri, who will presumably begin his first press conference next season by announcing that his ultimate aim is Premier League survival, before he goes on to beat Barcelona   in the Champions League final thanks to 23% possession and a winner from Wes Morgan. Daniel Taylor Ranieri, though I can’t help feel Quique Sánchez Flores would have been a decent choice any other year and wonder what more Watford could possibly have wanted. Louise Taylor It’s got to be Claudio. Brilliant man management, brilliant tactical tweaking, brilliant everything.  Paul Wilson Well though Pochettino and Jürgen Klopp have done it would be perverse to suggest anyone other than Ranieri. A class act from the start. Paul Doyle Dele Alli’s control, overhead flick and   volley against Crystal Palace was poetry. Dominic Fifield Alli’s goal to turn a tight contest in Tottenham Hotspur’s favour at Crystal Palace in January. Instinctive and stunning. Owen Gibson Alli v Crystal Palace. Amid a fine season for club and country, the fearless    played at times as though he was still in the schoolyard.  Barry Glendenning Vardy’s outrageous   volley against Liverpool in February was perhaps the most sublime Roy of the Rovers moment in a Roy of the Rovers season for the Leicester City striker. Andy Hunter Vardy v Liverpool. I’m always partial to a “pick that out” screamer but there was a little more to Vardy’s   shot over Simon Mignolet than the stunning execution. Mahrez’s ball and the significance of the goal  —   setting Leicester on their way to a win that kept them three points clear at the top ahead of the trip to Manchester City  —   added to the moment. David Hytner Cuco Martina v Arsenal, a       curler 19 minutes into his full league debut for Southampton. Even Martina looked stunned. Jamie Jackson Eden Hazard’s title decider against Spurs. The reigning double footballer of the year has hardly been a goal machine but his third of the season was hailed around the world. Stuart James Vardy’s brilliant dipping   lob, on the run, against Liverpool in February. You know that something special has happened when people are on their feet in the press box. Amy Lawrence A top five in no particular order you say? That’s just about managable: Vardy’s screeching first time volley Liverpool Dimitri Payet’s    free kick against Crystal Palace Martina’s absurd curler against Arsenal Alli’s delicate footwork on the turn against Palace and Hazard’s title swinger against Tottenham. Scott Murray “To be honest I was looking all game, because he was quite far off his line. ” Vardy on the questionable positioning of Mignolet, and why he bought a ticket to the raffle from 35 yards. Sachin Nakrani Martina for Southampton against Arsenal. I heard this goal before I saw it, listening to Southampton’s home game against Arsenal on the radio. The commentator went bananas and my initial thought was “there’s no way the goal is that good”  —   it was. Barney Ronay Vardy spanks it past Mignolet on the run. Planned and executed brilliantly. Jacob Steinberg In terms of its significance, it has to be Mahrez bamboozling the Manchester City defence with a drop of the shoulder, a swerve of the hips and a dazzling stepover before putting Leicester   up at the Etihad.  Daniel Taylor Matt Ritchie for Bournemouth against Sunderland. It’s the angle behind the man that shows it best  —   the chest control, the spinning volley and then the power of the shot, off the outside of his boot, as it arcs into the top corner. Louise Taylor Vurnon Anita for Newcastle United against Manchester City. The midfielder, operating out of position at   had not scored for more than two years when he met Moussa Sissoko’s clever pass, dodged Aleksandar Kolarov, cut inside and shot unerringly beyond Hart.  Paul Wilson Vardy against Liverpool. There were other candidates, but Vardy’s devastating strike from such a long way out summed up the audacity of Leicester’s title challenge. Paul Doyle Leicester   Aston Villa. This summed up a thrilling and barmy season, as Aston Villa looked deceptively slick for about an hour, going   up through fine goals, before being blown away by the rising champions in a stonking atmosphere. Dominic Fifield The most dramatic I witnessed   were those at Stamford Bridge as José Mourinho’s tenure at the then champions unravelled. Perhaps Bournemouth’s late victory in December, as the end edged inexorably closer, was the most  . It all seems such a long time ago. Owen Gibson Leicester City’s humbling of Manchester City at the Etihad  —   a performance full of pace, power and ferocious intent (not to mention two goals from Robert Huth).  Barry Glendenning Norwich City   Liverpool had pretty much everything, including a pair of spectacles smashed in the celebrations following Adam Lallana’s late, late winner. Andy Hunter Manchester City   Leicester City. For importance, a complete team performance and a game that announced something remarkable was occurring in the Premier League, nothing compared to it. David Hytner Newcastle United   Manchester United. Thrilling lunacy, largely because most people fully expected a dismal   between two teams who did not know where the net was. Paul Dummett’s   equaliser for Newcastle brought the house down. Jamie Jackson Manchester City   Leicester City. A display that included Mahrez bamboozling three defenders plus Hart to score the second just after the break. Ranieri’s men gained a   lead and never looked back. Stuart James Manchester City   Leicester City. With 20 minutes to go a message flashed up from Leicester’s official twitter account that read: “So if you’re just joining us. .. #lcfc are leading   and Robert Huth is on a  . ” What a wonderfully bonkers game.  Amy Lawrence Tottenham   Chelsea. A sensational game with a load of drama and a meaningful outcome. It might not have been to the purist’s tastes with the odes to Chopper Harris and all that but witnessing such souped up commitment was special. Scott Murray Chelsea   Tottenham Hotspur. An   donnybrook that emptied the benches and spilled down the tunnel. Marvellous entertainment. It even adhered to the old   joke: in the middle of it all, a football match broke out.  Sachin Nakrani Leicester   Chelsea. A night when English football’s tectonic plates shifted. Leicester returned to top spot with a display over the champions that was so dominant that the thought of them winning the title no longer felt outlandish.  Barney Ronay Right now the last one I went to, the wild, loopy farewell to Upton Park. Comebacks, goals, terrible defending, violence, sentimental music, angry people talking about buses. What more could anyone want? Jacob Steinberg The final game at Upton Park. Atmosphere, emotion and incredible drama as West Ham beat Manchester United  . Daniel Taylor Manchester City   Leicester City. The day when most people realised Leicester weren’t going anywhere. The score flattered Manchester City and it was   to see a team of their riches dismantled that way on their own ground. Louise Taylor As north east correspondent there’s certainly a few candidates for worst match but the best? Possibly Newcastle   Chelsea  —   back in the day when there was still hope for both Steve McClaren and Mourinho. Chelsea were two down but pulled it back courtesy of fine goals from Ramires and Willian. Paul Wilson Either Manchester City   Liverpool, or Manchester City   Leicester City, both of which I had the privilege to attend. Probably the latter, in terms of waking everyone up to the quality and ruthlessness the eventual champions could bring to bear. Paul Doyle Mike Dean still has the best celebrations. Dominic Fifield Mark Clattenburg appears to be the governing body’s official of choice, but even the most innocuous decision is put under so much high definition,   scrutiny these days that every team or fan will have their own particular gripe with each referee. Owen Gibson He’s been chosen to referee the Champions League final so Clattenburg can’t be too shabby. Clattenburg is rarely caught out of position and retains a natural authority.  Barry Glendenning The sign of a good referee is one whose presence goes unnoticed, so it’s difficult to say. Most seem to do a fairly decent job in almost impossible circumstances. Andy Hunter Michael Oliver, Clattenburg and Anthony Taylor have all improved this season. Of course they remain capable of the occasional error and Oliver would be the preference for how he handles and communicates with players. David Hytner Clattenburg. He deserves to have the Champions League final. Seems to get most of the big decisions right. Jamie Jackson All or none of them. It’s the impossible job tackled by a bunch of brave souls. Or the possible job tackled by a bunch of   souls. You decide. Stuart James Not a category to get excited about but Clattenburg strikes me as a decent referee with the social skills to “get on” with players while still doing his job. Amy Lawrence The fact that Clattenburg has the Champions League final shows he is rated pretty highly by his peers. Scott Murray Clattenburg, for his delicate,   handling of Chelsea   Tottenham. Here’s to another freewheeling,   windmilling classic in the Champions League final, starring Clattenburg, Sergio Ramos and Diego Simeone. Sachin Nakrani Unlike 99% of people who watch football in this country, I don’t have a strong view on referees. They all seem roughly the same and their mistakes, while occasionally astonishing, never entice me into reaching for a pitchfork. If I had to chose someone, I’d go for Jon Moss. Just to annoy Twitter. Barney Ronay We need to stop talking about referees. Jacob Steinberg Probably not Moss. Michael Oliver has been fine. None of them stand out, though.  Daniel Taylor Clattenburg, probably. Oliver is usually reasonable as well, with Moss at the other end of the scale. Louise Taylor Clattenburg. Apart from clearly being an excellent technician his communication skills set him a little bit apart. Paul Wilson Graham Poll, or Keith Hackett, or any other the other   who never made a mistake in their active careers but now turn up in various media outlets criticising the poor performances of their successors. You should not have had to issue three yellow cards to the same player in a World Cup to understand that referees have a difficult job and are not going to be perfect all the time. Respect should start at home. Paul Doyle From John Stones to Mats Hummels, everyone covets a central defender who can build from the back but Southampton got themselves ones that can actually defend, too. Virgil Van Dijk replaced Toby Alderweireld so well after signing from Celtic last summer that Southampton have already given him a new   contract. Dominic Fifield N’Golo Kanté at Leicester City. Owen Gibson Kanté, again. At just £5. 6m from Caen, the unassuming Frenchman who drives a Mini to training was the snip of the season.. Barry Glendenning Kanté. Andy Hunter Kanté. There is no competition for the player that Steve Walsh, Leicester’s head of recruitment, convinced Ranieri to sign for £5. 6m from Caen last summer. First for tackles and interceptions in the Premier League this season. Where were all the other scouts? David Hytner Alderweireld. Tottenham were weak at the back last season. This time out, they conceded fewer goals than anybody in the division. The Belgian has barely put a foot wrong.  Jamie Jackson Anthony Martial, £36m rising to £58. 8m. The Frenchman is only 19 but is at least a class above the rest at Manchester United. Expect him to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona before he is finished. Stuart James Kanté by a distance. Runs miles, forever throwing himself into tackles and making interceptions, and never looks remotely tired. He can play as well. And Leicester got all of that for £5. 6m. Amy Lawrence Kanté. If Carlsberg made adverts for football scouts . .. Scott Murray Martial, who could potentially cost Manchester United £58. 8m, had quite a bit to prove. It took him 22 minutes of his debut, against Liverpool, to get that job out of the way. Sachin Nakrani Kantéhas established himself as one of the most dynamic and consistently excellent midfielders in the country. Barney Ronay Kanté, a midfielder who appears to “cover every blade of grass” but in fact only covers the ones he really needs to, albeit with real drive and craft. Jan Kirchhoff, Wahbi Khazri and Lamine Koné wasn’t a bad January treble. Jacob Steinberg Kanté’s midfield dynamism, diligence and quality has ensured that Leicester did not suffer from losing Esteban Cambiasso, their best player last season. Daniel Taylor Kanté. Steve Walsh, Leicester’s head of recruitment, put it nicely when he described their midfield as: “Drinkwater in the middle and Kanté either side. ” Louise Taylor Kirchhoff. To Sunderland from Bayern Munich reserves for £750, 000 in January. An apparently failed centre half, the German was immediately converted to an anchoring midfielder and has helped transform Wearside fortunes. Talk about value for money. Paul Wilson Kanté is the obvious answer here, but let’s give the Leicester theme a rest and go for Alderweireld. Most of the big clubs were in the market for defenders, Tottenham signed one of the best for a very reasonable £11. 4m. The Belgian has barely put a foot wrong all season. Paul Doyle José Mourinho. Hopefully, as lobbyists tried to land him the Manchester Untied job at last, Mourinho has spent recent months exploring the one conspiracy theory that he has not yet publicly examined: he was the architect of his own spectacular downfall. Dominic Fifield Florian Thauvin’s three Premier League starts after a £12m move from Marseille probably drew the line under Newcastle’s dalliance with the French market, particularly as he ended the season back at Stade Vélodrome on loan. Owen Gibson Chelsea’s title defence. So many things went wrong that it’s hard to know here to start but the destabilising Eva Carneiro farce is as good a place as any. Antonio Conte has a big job on his hands.  Barry Glendenning Thauvin turned up at Newcastle in a tuxedo and left on loan in ignominy after failing to register an assist or goal in 13 Premier League appearances after his £12m move from Marseille on a   deal. Five years! Andy Hunter Mourinho and Chelsea. From comfortable title winners in May to a disorganised, uncommitted and weak team with 12 defeats to its name by Christmas. Chelsea’s players were rightly blamed for getting another manager the sack but that does not excuse Mourinho’s part in his downfall. David Hytner Memphis Depay. The £25m arrival from PSV Eindhoven has shown flickers of his ability but there have been too many times when he has failed to make any impact. Jamie Jackson Bastian Schweinsteiger. Plagued all year by injury, as he was in recent seasons at Bayern Munich: what were Manchester United doing buying him? Stuart James Aston Villa could make a legitimate case to “own” this category. As for some individual contenders, Depay, Christian Benteke, Pedro, Thauvin and Raheem Sterling must be in the mix, and what on earth happened to that bloke called Eder at Swansea? Amy Lawrence Mourinho. The unseemly episode surrounding Carneiro on the opening day of the season set a dreadful tone. It is hard to think of a title defence as pitiful as Chelsea’s this season and that came straight from the manager. Scott Murray Benteke scored a spectacular bicycle kick at Old Trafford, tucked away the most nerveless penalty of the season at Crystal Palace, and was one of only three players to score a winner against Leicester. But if relationships don’t click, they don’t click. Mind you, if he comes off the bench to decide the Europa League final, there’s a   dilemma and a half for Jürgen Klopp. Sachin Nakrani Chelsea. It started badly  —   with Mourinho lashing out at club doctors  —   and did not get much better.  Barney Ronay Eden Hazard on a    flop scale: surely the most flaccid reigning player of the year ever.  Jacob Steinberg Arsène Wenger. This was the year when Arsenal were supposed to make the most of all that potential. Yet even though Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City have all underperformed, seemingly leaving the path clear for Arsenal, they still couldn’t capitalise. Daniel Taylor Hazard. Did Mourinho really once say that Hazard might have overtaken Cristiano Ronaldo as the most phenomenal player on the planet bar Lionel Messi?  Louise Taylor If we are talking managers   Mourinho. If it’s players   Thauvin, the fragile winger Newcastle signed from Marseille for more than £12m but who is now back in the south of France on loan. Paul Wilson Were you to ask the Manchester City fans in my local they would unhesitatingly point the finger at Sterling, though in his case flop might be a tad harsh. If the definition of flop is a big reputation delivering little in the way of results, look no further than Steve McClaren at Newcastle. Paul Doyle Chris Kamara plays the jester role well and Owen Hargreaves is quietly insightful. Dominic Fifield Gary Neville up to the moment he opted to pursue a career in management with Valencia, though Jamie Carragher upped his game impressively thereafter.  Owen Gibson Five years after being mocked for knowing nothing about Hatem Ben Arfa, Alan Shearer is a man transformed. Fully committing himself to television work has paid off and he has become a major reason why Match of the Day no longer has to be fast forwarded between games.  Barry Glendenning Danny Higginbotham has proved quite the revelation since filing his first column for The Sentinel in Stoke a couple of years ago and is increasingly in demand. Andy Hunter Graeme Souness once again, although he can stray into “in my day” territory too often. A commanding, insightful presence otherwise. David Hytner Jermaine Jenas. Having only recently retired, he has a connection to many of the players and offers excellent insight into their playing styles and personalities. Has a nice way of making his tactical points. Jamie Jackson Chris Sutton. Loves  —   really loves  —   an opinion.  Stuart James Graeme Souness talks a lot of sense. Sharp with his analysis, not afraid to tell it how it is and not the sort to trot out those throwaway lines, like: “They’ve got enough to stay up. ” Amy Lawrence Graeme Souness. His straight talking style of punditry and excellent analysis is always of a high standard. Scott Murray A   between Michael Owen and Chris Sutton, who before Norwich v Liverpool in January were asked: will Norwich stay up? Owen: “No. ” Will Liverpool make the Champions League places? Sutton: “No. ” Not a beat skipped. Refreshingly honest, pandering to nobody. Admittedly there are other issues here, but let’s accentuate the positive. Sachin Nakrani Jamie Carragherstepped out of Gary Neville’s shadow and has become the leading voice on Monday Night Football, consistently showing a thoughtful, intelligent approach to football analysis.  Barney Ronay Graeme Souness. It’s always Souness. Frankly he could spend 30 minutes reading out the ingredients of a tin of baked beans over and over again and so long as he did it with a look of pure wincing soulfully exasperated contempt I’d watch right to the end. Jacob Steinberg Owen Hargreaves and Rio Ferdinand have been very good on Champions League nights, while Jamie Carragher is exemplary on Monday Night Football, but no one is as watchable as a seething Graeme Souness. Daniel Taylor Jamie Carragher asks the right questions, makes good points and writes an excellent column for the Daily Mail too. Graeme Souness is always watchable and, on radio, David Pleat is perhaps the best judge of a player (he told me Dele Alli would be a star a long time back).  Louise Taylor David Pleat on Radio 5 Live. Clear, concise and tells you something new in good English.  Paul Wilson I don’t know. But I think Gary Neville might be the bravest. Paul Doyle The fact that every gripe is merely the prelude to a triumphant explanation by Roberto Martínez. Dominic Fifield José Mourinho’s reaction to a member of his medical staff performing her duties in stoppage time on the campaign’s opening day against Swansea City. Owen Gibson That even a life affirming, joyously unpredictable season was undercut by the constant, dispiriting drip drip about a European Super League, a closed shop Champions League, guaranteed European qualification for the biggest “brands” or whatever.  Barry Glendenning Assorted players, managers, fans, broadcasters, journalists and other football folk griping far too angrily about unimportant matters. Andy Hunter Contributing, as a taxpayer, towards West Ham United’s exorbitant relocation to the Olympic Stadium and thereby improving the investment portfolio of a couple of  . David Hytner For some reason, I hate it when the league is referred to as ‘The Barclays Premier League,’ either in copy or on TV. It’s not incorrect, just jarring. Jamie Jackson The view that Leicester City cannot win the Champions League. Really? If a misfiring Manchester City can be a goal away from the final, why the heck not? Stuart James When Bafetimbi Gomis scored at Manchester City, ending a      goal drought, and decided not to do his “panther” celebration. You try explaining that kind of behaviour to his biggest fan (aged four). Just messing with kids’ minds, leaving parents to pick up the pieces. What you did after scoring at Upton Park last Saturday, Gomis, was too little too late. Amy Lawrence The growing sense of entitlement that grips certain clubs and certain fanbases. Scott Murray No matches over the Easter holidays. International friendlies simply don’t cut it on English football’s traditional   weekend, no matter how many   leads the world champions let slip. Sachin Nakrani The ubiquity of betting adverts. The gambling industry has wrapped itself around football in this country, and that is seen most starkly with the number of ads for bookies. Most of them are terrible and it will be a great day when I am able to turn on my TV and not be confronted by Ray Winstone’s massive head. Barney Ronay Teams chasing the title should play as much as possible on the same day. I know. TV. But it doesn’t work well as a spectacle or as good sporting practice. Jacob Steinberg I only went to Villa Park once this season, to see Tim Sherwood’s Aston Villa lose   to Stoke City, and there was an intolerable apathy and sadness about the place. Villa are in danger of being run into the ground by Randy Lerner and their stay in the Championship could be a long one. Daniel Taylor Managers who try to deceive everyone in press conferences by pretending their team has played well, usually after   defeats, and the number of famous Leicester fans who have suddenly turned up (who, funnily enough, I never remember seeing in four years of covering the club on a daily basis). Louise Taylor That Newcastle United did not replace Steve McClaren with Rafa Benítez a little sooner.  Paul Wilson Monday night football. If it has to happen, and I suppose television is paying enough money to do pretty much as it chooses, could not the games be selected a little more randomly? I don’t think it was fair that Tottenham had to play on three consecutive Mondays at the end of the season. Paul Doyle Transparent and accurate  . Clocks should be seen to be stopped for goal celebrations, substitutions, natters before   rolling around and whenever the ball goes out of play. Everyone should know exactly long is left.  Dominic Fifield How about having     squads, with a guarantee that at least five (a number plucked from the ether) have been nurtured through the club’s academy or youth system? That might encourage a few more youngsters on the benches with a chance of   in the top flight. Owen Gibson Almost certainly a folorn hope, especially with the advent of Friday night Premier League football, but it would be nice if the new £30 price cap on away tickets was accompanied by at least a modicum of respect for the most loyal fans in the game when it comes to fixtures shunted around the calendar for television at short notice.  Barry Glendenning A bit of consideration for travelling fans from TV schedulers   their Saturday lunchtime matches is probably too much to hope for. Andy Hunter Transfer deadline day being the day before the Premier League season starts. David Hytner It’s an old chestnut but the clubs have to do more to lower the price of tickets. With the new TV deal incoming, they can afford it. It’s so wrong that many parents cannot afford to take their kids. Jamie Jackson Referees to give   interviews. Stuart James Cancel the introduction of Friday night Premier League football  —   a rubbish idea (you only need to look at the Aston   United game last August to know that). Amy Lawrence It would be great for the train companies to put on more services, especially late ones, to cover fans getting home from night games.  Scott Murray The removal of all electronic scoreboards, big screens and animated hoardings. No shirt sponsorship. Plastic flags, clappers and mobile phones to be replaced by rattles, flat caps and untipped cigarettes. Match of the Day to be transmitted in black and white. Sachin Nakrani An end to ridiculous   times. But that would require the Premier League standing up to Sky Sports and BT Sport, which sadly is highly unlikely to happen.  Barney Ronay Players covering their mouths like FBI mafiosi suspects while having routine conversations about nightclubs and designer watches punished by being forced to repeat verbatim their entire conversation on camera  —   in the voice of Daffy Duck. Jacob Steinberg This is probably world’s smallest violin playing the world’s saddest song territory but Manuel Pellegrini did have a point when he complained about the questionable scheduling of domestic matches before Champions League ties.  Daniel Taylor A proper,   debate about   (ideally, leading to it being introduced). The clue is in the title  —   it’s safe  —   and there are people on Merseyside who want this debate, too. Louise Taylor Abolish Friday night football. No one needs it. A field too far.  Paul Wilson The   at Liverpool over proposed ticket prices has largely been forgotten about since, what with the Klopp revolution, a European final and the Hillsborough verdicts. Football admission is never going to be cheap again, not in the way that it once was, but one would like to think both clubs and spectators have got the message that organised terrace protest can help keep a greedy industry in check."
"In the beginning, they were known as die Dönermorde  —   the kebab murders. The victims had little in common, apart from immigrant backgrounds and the modest businesses they ran. The first to die was Enver Şimşek, a      man who ran a   company in the southern German town of Nuremberg. On 9 September 2000, he was shot inside his van by two gunmen, and died in hospital two days later. The following June, in the same city,    Abdurrahim Özüdoğru was killed by two bullets while helping out after hours in a tailor’s shop. Two weeks later, in Hamburg, 500km north, Süleyman Taşköprü, 31, was shot three times and died in his greengrocer’s shop. Two months later, in August 2001, greengrocer Habil Kılıç, 38, was shot twice in his shop in the Munich suburbs. The crime scenes indicated that the killers favoured a particular killing method. Typically, several shots were fired at close range to the face. Most of the bullets were traced back to a single weapon, a silenced Česká CZ 83 pistol. Police assumed that the professional method of killing, as well as the intimate nature of the murders  —   when they died, the victims were presumably looking directly into the eyes of their killers  —   meant that the murders must have been carried out by Turkish gangsters fighting out turf battles. No hard evidence ever substantiated this theory. Nevertheless, the taskforce assigned by the German authorities to the case was given the name “Bosphorus”. The Bosphorus team tried to persuade the widow of Enver Şimşek, the first victim, to say that her husband was connected to the Turkish mafia. They invented a false story of marital infidelity  —   that Şimşek was having an affair and had a secret family elsewhere  —   in the hope that her fury would lead her to reveal his   underworld ties. She said nothing, but the police continued to waste time and resources attempting to prove the killings were the work of Turkish gangs. Three years later, in 2004, Mehmet Turgut, 25, was murdered in a kebab shop in the city of Rostock on the Baltic coast. The next attack came later that year in the form of a bomb detonated in the Keupstrasse area of Cologne  —   a part of town popular among Turkish immigrants.   people were wounded. In June 2005, İsmail Yaşar, 50, was shot in his kebab shop in Nuremberg  —   the third murder in that city. The following year, a      locksmith named Theodoros Boulgarides was killed in his newly opened shop in Munich. He was the first victim without a Turkish background. In 2006, a kiosk vendor named Mehmet Kubaşık, 39, was shot in the western city of Dortmund. Only two days after that, Halit Yozgat, 21, was killed while sitting behind his desk in the internet cafe he ran in the central German city of Kassel, 160km away. The killings occurred in seven different cities across Germany, and were often separated by months or years. This made it difficult to connect them, though no one expected it to take until 2006 for the authorities to grasp how they were related. From the very start, the investigation was riddled with basic errors and faulty assumptions. First, at least two of the murders took place at locations close to police stations, which should have made them unattractive sites for mafia murders. Then there was the problem of the two “   men” on bicycles whom eyewitnesses described leaving several of the crime scenes. More baffling still was a fact that surfaced during the investigation of Halit Yozgat’s killing: a German intelligence agent had been inside the cafe when the murder took place  —   something he later neglected to report. In 2006, Alexander Horn, a young police profiler who prepared a report on the case for the Bosphorus team, began to cast doubts on the idea that the murders were connected to the Turkish mafia. In several cases, the victims were killed on days when they had broken with their daily routine, and were in places that no one could have predicted. It seemed more plausible that the victims had been chosen randomly by the killers, rather than singled out for vengeance by professional hitmen. By using the same weapon, the killers also appeared to be drawing attention to their crimes and underlining the connection between them. Horn identified this as a typical tactic of   groups. Some officers were assigned to pursue this lead, but the focus of the investigation remained on the police’s initial theory. The media continued to refer to the killings as die Dönermorde. In November 2011, more than a decade after the first murder, DVDs containing a curious recording were dropped off at the offices of several German newspapers. They featured a doctored episode of the 1960s cartoon series, the Pink Panther, which appeared to be a message from the killers. For the first few minutes, the Pink Panther strolls around a city, where he sees a poster calling on citizens to “Stand with your country” and “Stand with your people”. Accompanied by the jaunty chords of Henry Mancini’s theme song, the character bombs a grocery store  —   then the video cuts to news footage of a shop that had been similarly attacked in Cologne in 2001. The Pink Panther lounges on his couch and watches television news clips about the   Dönermorde. The clips flickering on his cartoon television are of real news reports from the murder scenes, with gruesome photographs of the victims. The Pink Panther’s eyes glaze over with boredom at how long it takes the German public to realise who is behind them. With a huff of impatience, the narrator indicates a sign on the screen: the murders, the video suggests, are the work of a group calling itself the National Socialist Underground (NSU). By the time the German press was puzzling over the Pink Panther video, the investigators’ focus had finally narrowed to a cluster of extreme rightwing groups operating in the country. The authorities had still not figured out how to find the killers, but their confusion was brought to an abrupt end on 4 November 2011, when two men used bicycles in a bank robbery in Eisenach, a town in the central German state of Thuringia. After the robbery, they loaded the bikes into a rented camper van. After a   police found the vehicle nearby. The two men had a vast stockpile of guns and ammunition inside the vehicle, but they did not try to fight their way out. Instead, according to investigators, they chose to kill themselves and set fire to the van. (An official report later concluded that one of the men had set the van alight, killed the other and then himself.) The bodies were identified as those of Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Böhnhardt, two longstanding but hitherto unremarkable members of Germany’s enduring   scene, who had escaped the police with their friend Beate Zschäpe 13 years earlier. Even before identifying the corpses, investigators had found in their van the gun of a murdered police officer, Michèle Kiesewetter, whose killing five years earlier had never been solved. Four days after the death of Mundlos and Böhnhardt, Zschäpe called the police in the Thuringian city of Jena. “Beate Zschäpe here,” she said. “I’m the one you’re here for. ” The local authorities did not immediately grasp the significance of the call, even though more than a decade earlier the police had searched for all three in connection with a series of smaller crimes. German intelligence services had also been keeping tabs on the rightwing radical scene that Zschäpe was a part of, but had lost track of her, along with Mundlos and Böhnhardt when they went underground. The three had been living together in the town of Zwickau in an apartment that Zschäpe burned down after she learned of the deaths of Mundlos and Böhnhardt. When police later searched the scorched apartment, they found newspaper clippings about the murders of the   businessmen, copies of the Pink Panther DVD, and the Česká pistol. This was early evidence that linked Mundlos, Böhnhardt, and Zschäpe to the murders that had first been investigated by the Bosphorus group. On 6 May 2013, after two years of sensationalist speculation about the NSU in the German press, Zschäpe appeared for the first time in a Munich courtroom, charged with nine murders, an attack on police that included a murder, and two attempted murders by bombing. Four other men also stand accused of providing support to the NSU. Rather than investigating how   killers could have operated undetected for so long, most of the German media opted for lurid coverage of the NSU, insisting that it consisted of only three people. Der Spiegel took the lead with a cover story dedicated to “  precision” of what it called the “Brown Army Faction” with photographs that portrayed Zschäpe, Mundlos and Böhnhardt as   killers, ready for their Hollywood  . For the media, it was Bonnie and Clyde and Clyde  —   offering the salacious possibility of a murderous menage a trois. The German tabloid Bild ran the headline “The Devil has dressed up,” after Zschäpe appeared at the opening of the trial in a   jewellery and freshly dyed hair. Zschäpe, now 41, has been sitting in court every weekday morning in Munich for the past three years, but she has revealed almost nothing  —   despite the urgent pleas of the families of the victims. While she claims that she now understands that Mundlos and Böhnhardt had conducted bank robberies and killings, she claims not to have known anything about their plans or activities while she lived with them. “They had become my family,” she said. Her plea is not guilty. But the significance of the trial is far larger than what Zschäpe did or did not know about the killing spree. Germany’s sense of itself is also on trial. The findings of the prosecution suggest that Germany, a nation that prides itself on having confronted the dark recesses of its past with unique diligence, has left a thriving underground culture of rightwing extremism untouched. Alternative für Deutschland  —   the first   populist party in Germany to enjoy sustained electoral success since the second world war  —   is only the latest in a series of symptoms of a widespread animosity toward the postwar liberal consensus. Darker currents of discontent are openly displayed on the internet  —   and on newsstands and television, where rightwing arguments have increasingly found favour. The German government has been content to write off the NSU as a   terror cell of sociopaths  —   an unfortunate, but exceptional recrudescence of a political syndrome that the country has long since inoculated itself against. However, the NSU murder investigation and Zschäpe’s trial suggest that the organisation may have been carefully supported and protected by elements of the state itself. The first thing to understand about the National Socialist Underground is that it was never really underground. Beate Zschäpe first met Uwe Mundlos when they were teenagers, at an   youth club in Jena, a renowned university town, perched on the slate mountains of the former East German state of Thuringia. It was 1991 and many East Germans were still feeling the shock of the fall of the Berlin Wall and acutely aware of how much they lacked in comparison to their western neighbours. The youth club is still there today, set in a strip of   buildings on a quiet street with dramatic views of the surrounding valleys. When we visited the neighbourhood earlier this year, it seemed normal enough:   apartment blocks, playgrounds full of children, direct trams to the city centre. A new school was being built across the street from the youth club, with placards advertising places for the children of asylum seekers. There were a few ominous signs, though, such as the German flags that were hanging from a few   balconies. Anywhere else, they would be an innocuous show of patriotism, but in this part of Germany the flag can send a different signal. Thuringia has long been one of the heartlands of Germany’s radical right. In the 1990s, the youth club was a focal point in the emerging   scene. Former supervisors at the club remember turning a blind eye  —   for fear of losing the trust of the cool kids  —   when teenagers gave each other birthday party invitations with small swastikas on them. At her trial, Zschäpe described meeting and falling in love with Mundlos during her adolescence in the late 1980s. Then on her 19th birthday, she met and fell in love with Mundlos’s friend, Uwe Böhnhardt, who was even more committed to the rightwing extremist cause. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall, to become a   in East Germany was a form of youthful rebellion against the state. What better way to antagonise communist elites than to parade around as their old enemy? After 1989 and the fall of the wall,   became a conduit for rage against the pieties  —   and the perceived humiliations and betrayals  —   of the newly unified Federal Republic of Germany. West Germany’s identity had long been bound up with its productivity and wealth in comparison to East Germany. Meanwhile, its politicians and intellectuals embraced what the country’s leading philosopher, Jürgen Habermas, called “Constitutional patriotism”. It would be an identity based on a shared commitment to ideas rather than one founded on blood.  This new West German identity was something Zschäpe, Mundlos and Böhnhardt fiercely rejected. But there was nothing in their backgrounds that made them particularly susceptible to rightwing extremism. Zschäpe’s childhood does not appear to have been especially tumultuous, though she had a troubled relationship with her mother. (Zschäpe never met her biological father, who was Romanian.) The backgrounds of the two men are even further from the stereotype of the backward, resentful easterner. Böhnhardt’s father worked as an engineer and his mother as a teacher Mundlos’s father was an IT professor at the Jena University of Applied Sciences. The parents treated their children’s developing interest in Nazi history and   as a passing phase. (Although Zschäpe’s mother later reported that she was concerned when she heard that Mundlos’s grandfather collected Nazi curios.) “Their experience was far from unique,” said Martin Debes, a journalist for the Thüringer Allgemeine newspaper, who grew up in Jena at the same time as Zschäpe and the two Uwes. “But in the youth scene at the time you often had to choose: become a   or a punk. ” Zschäpe started out as a punk, joining a nominally leftwing group known as “the Ticks” that got into fights with local  . But at the Jena youth club Mundlos and Böhnhardt encouraged her to switch sides, and in a few years the three of them had joined the flourishing   scene in the newly reunified Germany. They devoted weekends to battling leftwing punks in the streets and attending concerts of   bands such as Türkenjäger (“Turk hunter”) and Endsieg (“Final Victory”). Some of their early stunts included touring the former grounds of Buchenwald while dressed up in   SS uniforms, and inventing a board game called “Pogromly” which rewarded players for sending as many Jews as possible to concentration camps. The fall of the Berlin Wall offered East German   a new focus for their rage. As   and Germans of other backgrounds began moving into the east, there were   and violence. Kebab stalls that sprung up in the tiniest towns of Thuringia became regular targets for young  . In September 1991, rightwing extremists attacked housing facilities for asylum seekers in Hoyerswerda, a town 200km east of Jena in the state of Saxony. The attacks were the start of a new brand of violence throughout Germany. During a   riot in the city of Rostock on the Baltic coast in August 1992, several thousand people surrounded a   asylum shelter and watched while   threw Molotov cocktails through the windows. The building’s Vietnamese and Roma inhabitants barely survived by fleeing to the roof, and passing their babies up the stairs along a human chain. The attacks were not confined to the former East Germany. On the night of 22 November 1992,   set fire to two houses of Turkish families in Mölln, a small town in the   state of  . Two girls and a    woman died in the flames. Nine others were seriously injured. In 1993, skinheads in Solingen, a town outside Cologne, set fire to the home of a Turkish family, killing five people, including three children. This violence seemed senseless and random, but it was effective. All the major political parties of the time bowed to pressure applied by rightwing extremists. Helmut Kohl’s conservative coalition government called for new limits on immigration. In 1992 and 1993, his expanded coalition, with support from the Social Democratic party, changed the German constitution to limit the country’s obligation to admit asylum seekers. The   rejoiced at finding its arguments winning the day on mainstream TV. For Zschäpe, Mundlos and Böhnhardt this was apparently not enough. After their early years of   crime, investigators claim that they began trying to build homemade bombs. In January 1998 the police, tipped off by an anonymous source, searched Böhnhardt’s garage in Jena and discovered 1. 4kg of TNT  —   enough to destroy a car. By the time an arrest warrant was issued later that day, Böhnhardt had fled Jena. Together with Zschäpe and Mundlos, he later hid in the city of Zwickau, 80km to the east. During their decade on the run, Zschäpe, Böhnhardt and Mundlos seem to have worked odd jobs and in shops that sold Nazi paraphernalia under the counter. At the trial, Zschäpe has been accused of helping the two men supplement their income with a series of bank robberies, which the three friends carried out together in a number of towns in Thuringia and    between 1999 and 2011. Sometimes they entered wearing gorilla masks, sometimes masks from the movie Scream. Their trusted escape method was allegedly to ride bicycles to a nearby rented van, in which they waited until the search for them had ended. The German police managed to link the robberies to each other, but not to Zschäpe, Böhnhardt and Mundlos. The three fugitives showed few signs of concern about their possible capture. They used fake IDs and rented their apartment under aliases, but took few precautions beyond that. Neighbours fed their cats when they were away, and it appears that friends visited each week when they were home, sometimes bringing their children. With patience and an almost languid sense of impunity, Zschäpe and the two Uwes allegedly conducted the longest, and most intricate, political killing spree in postwar German history. When we visited the Munich courtroom earlier this year, all eyes were trained on Zschäpe, who stared at her laptop and seemed more worried about running out of the crate of coconut water she had brought to the trial than anything that might happen there. With her neat long hair and signature   she appeared deeply at ease, smiling like a professional model for a brief press photo session, before she settled back among the lawyers, from whom she is almost indistinguishable. In the press and visitors’ spectator booth, set behind glass above the courtroom,   bloggers, newspaper reporters, and law students studying the trial all sit together  —   alongside a loyal Zschäpe groupie. (The most notorious of Zschäpe’s fans, Anders Breivik, the   Norwegian terrorist, sent her a letter of solidarity from prison in 2012.) Zschäpe originally seems to have chosen her defence lawyers on the basis of their   surnames: Sturm (“Storm”) Stahl (“Steel”) and Heer (“Army”) but she soon turned against them. Four years into the trial, she has finally found a young lawyer she likes. The two whisper and smile during the court proceedings. The main judge at the trial, Manfred Götzl, has ordered the state lawyers she fired to remain in the courtroom because their departure could be grounds for an appeal: he wants to fend off any claim by Zschäpe that her current lawyer does not have full knowledge of the trial. Sturm, Stahl, and Heer sit a few chairs down from Zschäpe in what appears a state of permanent listlessness. Behind Zschäpe sits Ralf Wohlleben, a   accused of providing Böhnhardt and Mundlos with the Česká pistol used in the murders. His lawyer, Nicole Schneiders, first appeared in police reports on the extreme right when she was just 16 years old. The members of the   have taken up different, coordinated positions in the Munich courtroom. The lawyers and the accused sit side by side, and greet each other with kisses on the cheek. The prosecution has decided to treat Zschäpe’s case strictly as a murder trial. She is essentially charged with being the last surviving member of the group of three who are assumed to be responsible for the killings. The task of the trial, in this view, is simply to clarify whether  —   and to what degree  —   she was involved with the killings. There has been little effort on the part of the investigators and prosecutors to determine whether other rightwing extremists were involved. When one considers the level of local knowledge required to carry out these murders in several different German states  —   the detailed knowledge of getaway routes at the various crime scenes, the massive stockpile of weapons, the professionally forged fake IDs, not to mention the cost of these operations  —   the question of how the NSU could have operated without the support of a much larger network of sympathisers is unavoidable. Yet the prosecution appears at pains not to address this question. Still, despite its   procedures and its limited scope, the proceedings have provided a succession of strange revelations about the workings of the German state intelligence agency, known as the BfV, and its   branches, known as the LfV, which have led to allegations that elements within the agency either turned a blind eye to the NSU murders or supported the group’s aims. In summer 2013, Andreas Temme, the Hessian LfV agent who was inside Halit Yozgat’s internet cafe in Kassel when Yozgat was murdered, testified that he did not hear the silenced shots, nor did he notice the sprinkles of blood on the counter where he placed his payment in coins when he left. Spectators of the Munich trial agree that one of the most searing moments of the trial came when Yozgat’s father described how he found his dying son. It was impossible, he said, that Temme could have left the cafe without seeing the dead body behind the counter. “Why did you kill my son? What did he do to you?” he shouted at Zschäpe and Wohlleben in the courtroom. Temme, who denies any involvement, said that it was simply a coincidence he was in the cafe at the time of the murder and that he had been surfing dating websites. (“I was in the wrong place at the wrong time,” he said in an interview on German public television in July 2012.) When the police rounded up all those who were present at the scene of the murder, Temme did not come forward. After he was tracked down, Temme claimed that he did not volunteer any information because he was worried that his wife would discover his online proclivities. Yozgat’s father won approving nods from many in the audience at the trial when he declared: “We all know this man is lying. ” One of the prosecution’s witnesses, a policeman from the village where Temme grew up, testified that in his youth, Temme was known as “Little Adolf”. When the local police tried to dig deeper into allegations that Temme had a personal library of Nazi literature and weapons manuals, the interior minister of the state of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, shielded him from further investigations and from the press. Bouffier, who is now the prime minister of Hesse, argued at the time that it was necessary to protect Temme in order to “guarantee the protection of undercover agents”. The brazenness of Temme’s testimony ignited anger in the German press about the prerogatives of its intelligence agencies, but it has since mostly subsided. Temme has meanwhile retired from the LfV, but continues to draw his pension. Germany’s domestic intelligence service is charged with protecting the national constitution  —   from both foreign threats and domestic extremism on the left and right. But its record with regard to the latter has not always been stellar. In recent decades, it has tended to use paid informants who are already deeply entrenched in extremist milieus. In the case of the country’s   scene  —   whose membership the BfV estimates to number 23, 850 as of last year  —   these informants are not simply turncoats who make some money on the side by giving tips to police. Instead, they are lavishly groomed sources who are developed over long periods, promised legal protection, and plied with funds that elevate their status in the movement. By distributing cash to their informants, the BfV has hoped to create a paper trail that maps out connections between the far right across Germany. But in practice, this dispersal of money has also nurtured rightwing groups, providing them with a level of funding they would not have been able to obtain from their genuine followers. “There’s no question [that the] BfV overdid the financing of informants during the early 1990s,” said Hajo Funke, a professor of politics at the Free University of Berlin, who is the author of a book on the NSU. Before he was imprisoned in 2014, Tino Brandt, the man who first welcomed Zschäpe, Böhnhardt and Mundlos into the rightwing extremist scene in Jena, openly boasted to German public television that the state had given him 200, 000 Deutsche Marks (roughly €100, 000) in the early 1990s to print flyers and organise concerts and demonstrations. For his fellow   in Thuringia, Brandt’s work as a paid informant was an open secret. He never gave the state useful information, but his funds made organisational growth and the recruitment of young   possible. (Brandt himself was never tried for his connections to the NSU and   violence, but was sentenced to      in prison on 66 counts of child sexual abuse and child prostitution.) In March, Judge Götzl took an hour to explain to the courtroom that the task of the NSU trial is simply to judge the accused, not to investigate what German intelligence agents knew or did. The following month, Götzl rejected a petition from lawyers representing the victims’ families to introduce a witness who was a BfV informant in Zwickau at the time of the first killings, when he almost certainly knew the members of the NSU. Ralf Marschner, an avowed   and a former singer in a skinhead band called     was a paid informant for the BfV between 2000 and 2002. During these years, he lived around the corner from Zschäpe, Mundlos and Böhnhardt. “Marschner was the main   in Zwickau, which is a relatively small town,” says Dirk Laabs, an expert on the NSU. But when a government commission that was reviewing the NSU investigation tried to obtain Marschner’s file, it was told by a public prosecutor in Saxony that “a flood has destroyed the file”. According to Funke, Marschner is one of the most important witnesses, because he “proves that the BfV almost certainly would have known about the two Uwes and Beate, either directly through Marschner, or by monitoring his activities”. (Marschner, who is currently living in Switzerland, has refused to comment on the case to the press.) Earlier this year, the Munich courtroom learned that when Marschner was working as a paid informant for the BfV, he probably employed Mundlos in his construction company. It also seems likely that Zschäpe worked in his clothing shop, Heaven and Hell, which sold Nazi   and paraphernalia under the counter. The exact nature of Zschäpe’s work for Marschner remains remarkably unclear. These connections make Marschner a critical witness for the prosecution. And yet Judge Götzl has dismissed the effort to explore his role, describing his alleged employment of two NSU members as “irrelevant”. According to Bilgin Ayata, a professor of political sociology at the University of Basel, who has researched the case and the trial, these omissions are typical of the state’s unwillingness to examine the more disturbing implications of the NSU murders. “Instead of acknowledging the institutional racism that the case reveals,” Ayata said, “the state has presented its investigations as a series of unfortunate mishaps”. Zschäpe’s trial is the most significant courtroom showdown in Germany since the trial of the   gang  —   a   terrorist group also known as the Red Army Faction, who targeted US military installations, conservative media outlets and German corporations in the 1970s. Both cases go to the heart of Germany’s identity in postwar Europe. In the   case, the question was whether German youth were willing to be integrated into western capitalism, and whether the German state would lapse back into a form of authoritarianism. In the Zschäpe trial, it is a question of how far Germany really is from becoming a nation of immigrants and how far the values of tolerance have penetrated society. “The Red Army Faction wanted to bring down the German state,” said Hajo Funke. “The difference this time is that the National Socialist Underground got some help from part of the state. ” The head of the BfV, Heinz Fromm, resigned in 2012 while facing public pressure over the mishandling of the NSU investigation, but he never mentioned the reason for stepping down, nor has the BfV admitted any improprieties. Instead, BfV officials have strenuously guarded their sources and intelligence from both the normal police and from a special federal commission that was established in 2012 to probe lapses in the NSU investigation. But critics of the federal commission allege that it has also failed to dig deeper into the inconsistencies in the case. “The Federal Examination Commission has chosen not to question the claim that the NSU was confined to three people,” said Bilgin Ayata. The BfV has long been regarded as  : it was founded after the second world war by the Americans, who welcomed Nazis and former Gestapo members into its ranks. Its mission was to spy on and root out the KPD, as the German communist party was known, as well as members of the Social Democratic party. The first head of the organisation, Otto John, defected to East Germany in 1954, citing the overwhelming number of Nazis in the organisation. His successor was Hubert Schrübbers, a former member of the SS. Under Schrübbers’ supervision, the German communist party was finally banned in 1956, based on allegedly incriminating materials turned up by the BfV. Major German political parties  —   such as the Left party and the Greens  —   have long called for the abolition of the BfV. For now, neither police nor trial investigators have the right to subpoena BfV documents that may contain vital evidence about the NSU killings. There are still many mysteries about the true extent of the   killing spree  —   most notably the circumstances of the final murder, of the police officer Michèle Kiesewetter, which did not fit the pattern of the others. The prosecution has accused Mundlos and Böhnhardt of attacking two police officers on duty in the town of Heilbronn in April 2007: Kiesewetter, age 22, was killed instantly her   survived but has no memory of the attack. A nightly news report about the murder scene appears at the end of the Pink Panther video, and traces of Kiesewetter’s DNA were found among the charred remains of the Zwickau apartment that Zschäpe set on fire. But a different type of gun was used for Kiesewetter’s murder, and witnesses at the scene describe more than two people running away from the scene with blood on their clothes. Local police have declared these witnesses unreliable, and stated that only Mundlos and Böhnhardt were involved in the murder. But their reason for killing a police officer remains unknown, and the possible presence of others at the crime scene has further stoked fears that the NSU was not an organisation of only three people. “For the commissions and for the trial, the [size of the] NSU is a fait accompli,” Ayata said. “They ignore the questions that nag at the migrant communities in Germany: Are they still here? Are they still killing?” At a public commemoration of the victims of the NSU murders at the Konzerthaus Berlin in 2012, Angela Merkel asked for forgiveness on behalf of the investigators who had insisted that the victims were entangled in the Turkish mafia. “As chancellor, I will do everything I can to clear up the murders and uncover the accomplices and supporters, and bring all of the perpetrators to justice,” she said. But her government is hesitant to probe more deeply into the more troubling elements of the case, and of the rightwing extremist scene that continues to flourish in Germany. There is a telling contrast between the laxness of Zschäpe’s trial and the professionalism of the concurrent prosecution of the   “last” Nazi, Reinhold Hanning, a    former Auschwitz guard. Hanning’s trial was swiftly wrapped up in four months, and he was sentenced to five years in prison for “facilitating slaughter” at the extermination camp. It seems that Germany may be more comfortable trying former Nazis than current ones. More than three years into Zschäpe’s trial, the panel of judges now seems bored they take frequent recesses and appear to have lost interest in key witnesses. Where German officials have feared to tread, dramatists have rushed in. The NSU murders have already been the subject of several films and plays, including a miniseries that aired on German public television, and a play by the Austrian Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek. But theatrical versions of the trial cannot capture the complexity of the case, which seems impossible for anyone to fully grasp  —   especially when so much information still remains secret. Even the numerous   commissions established to review the botched investigation have had trouble assembling an accurate version of events. Most of the commissions have no authority to visit and search the BfV files. Instead they request files of interest, which the BfV delivers abridged and redacted. “We haven’t been granted the power to seize their files,” said Petra Pau, a parliamentarian for the Left party and a member of the federal commission looking into the case. “Not to mention the files they may have already shredded. ” One core problem is that too many expectations have been heaped on a trial that cannot bear them all. The victims’ families want justice and redemption, the judge wants no loose ends that could be grounds for a retrial, migrant communities want to know if they are safe from future attacks and terrorism, and political activists want to know whether the BfV was involved in a  . New pressure from Merkel’s government would be necessary to force BfV operatives to cooperate as witnesses. But there have been no steps in this direction. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis has fuelled Alternative für Deutschland’s rise to double digits in the polls, while hostility towards foreigners has become openly acceptable. The German ministry of the interior counted around 14, 000    crimes in 2015, about 30% more than in the previous year. By April 2016, police counted three attacks per day against housing facilities for asylum seekers. Last year, a small group  —   one woman and two men  —   threw a molotov cocktail into a Zimbabwean child’s bedroom at an asylum centre in Lower Saxony. The savage   climate of the 1990s is making a return. “The National Socialist Underground still has members out there,” said Petra Pau. “The question is only how many. ” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 16 December 2016 to correct the distance from Jena to Zwickau.

"Bowie was the first music I really connected with. I’m 19, so wasn’t around when he arrived, but he always felt modern to me  —   the way he challenged definitions, his confidence, the way he was a figure of   for people who don’t feel represented, as well as playing a character. After my mum texted to tell me that he had died, I got into the shower and cried. I suppose I was crying because it meant I would never get a chance to tell Bowie how important he’d been to us. Later I saw the reaction unfolding on Twitter, and it became clear that everyone was desperate to talk, to be together, to share his music. So I made a Facebook event, a street party in Brixton, near the mural of his portrait. In the first hour there were more than 500 responses  —   eventually that grew to 9, 000. I didn’t organise anything really. I just located a space. At 6pm there were only a couple of us with a guitar and loads of TV cameras. Then the crowds formed. Someone projected the Life on Mars video from their flat on to the wall. There were a lot of tears, but it was much happier than I thought it would be. At one point there were a thousand of us singing “Starman” at the top of our voices. Gender politics had always been a part of my life, but it was this that made me get involved with the Women’s Equality party and meet people like the Labour MP Stella Creasy, who invited me for a drink at the House of Commons. I suppose what she saw in me was someone who was staying true to their self, which seems to be the main thrust of what sparked people’s imaginations. I went into a bit of a bunker after it all blew up. I didn’t read any of the press about my awards, or follow it on social media, and to be honest, I’ve forgotten quite a lot about the whole thing, mainly because I’ve been working nonstop, first on a space film called Life, then on The Nutcracker, which of course have been totally different from Mad Max. If Nutcracker is nominated next year, I won’t wear a fancy gown. I’d look like Widow Twanky. Just like with Mad Max, I’d be paying homage to the film, so possibly there’d be some glitter involved. I’m still shocked at what an impact it had. I wore trousers  —   it ended up meaning so much more. I’m interested to see what everybody else wears this year. If it proved one thing, it’s the power of clothes. Go is seen as an artform in Asia and people have played it for thousands of years: they consider that it embodies the mysteries of the universe in some way. So we knew the DeepMind Go match was going to be quite a big event in South Korea, but we didn’t realise the whole country would come to a standstill watching it. We’d spent two years developing the AlphaGo artificial intelligence programme. Go is so complex  —   with more possible positions than atoms in the universe  —   that you need something akin to human intuition to win. The challenge was to mimic aspects of human intuition, like subconscious pattern matching. We knew AlphaGo had advantages and disadvantages. It can’t read Go books or learn from other people  —   it has to build its own knowledge. So before the match with grandmaster Lee Sedol, we didn’t know how well it was going to do. AlphaGo had played against itself a million times, but we weren’t sure if it would be weak against a human player who could be more creative. The evening before the match they were predicting a   loss: the consensus until then was that it would take another   years to develop a programme to beat a world champion. But it was how AlphaGo won that was amazing, with astounding moves that were so creative. Since that game, the top players all want to play against it. Sedol told me afterwards it was the most amazing experience of his life. When I saw that big English boy coming towards us with his mobile, happily shouting: “I’ve got a picture with the hijacker!” I couldn’t resist saying: “You are an idiot, man. ” I wish I’d slapped him. What if he really had a bomb? I fly often, but I’m not relaxed any more. Now I constantly look around. For the first two months I didn’t manage to get back to work. The hijacker was the man sitting in the aircraft tail, on the hostess seat, appearing and disappearing behind the curtains. In Cyprus, he released everyone apart from the staff and us, the five westerners. It scared me so badly. “Here we go,” I thought. We were gathered in the tail. I thought: I hope the commander managed to empty the fuel tanks, the hijacker might have explosives on him.  Then I thought, if I lower myself in the seat, it will help take the worst of the explosion. Meanwhile the English boy, Benjamin, goes to the bathroom and returns with that picture. I was so angry. As well as thinking it was absurd. I heard him saying on television that he got the picture to ascertain whether the belt was really explosive. Which is plainly not true. He smiled like a kid. I was not laughing. I was on the phone with my wife, telling her, “If anything happens to me, give my bike to a friend and ask him to scatter my ashes at full speed. ” Leicester got rid of manager Nigel Pearson and put Claudio Ranieri in charge and that made me think they could do really well. They had a manager with so much experience, anything could happen. The odds against winning the premier league were   which was very appealing. And stranger things have happened. I was camping in the middle of a field in Cornwall with my fiancée and I downloaded the William Hill app and put £1 on. It helped that I’d had a few drinks. Then I thought, if this actually happens I’ll be fuming at the end of the season  —   so I put £5 on them to win before they’d even kicked a ball. It was just banter all the way up to Christmas and then it started to sink in. I’m really not a nervous person, but towards the end of the season it was quite unbearable. It took over my life. What had been a laugh and a joke got more tense with each game. Just before the end of the season, they played Manchester United. I was on a stag weekend in Tallinn. I was actually sick that day through nerves  —   that’s how bad it got. I came back and Chelsea beat Spurs and that was it, Leicester had won. It was the weirdest feeling. It started off as a nice experience, but it got to a stage where it was just too much for me. You just can’t handle the number of phone calls you get. Stuff like that doesn’t happen to me. There were thousands of reports online, and pictures off my Facebook. I sort of embraced it. I thought, nothing like this is ever going to happen again. I didn’t do myself any favours. About a month before, it had all got too much, and I cashed out £2 of the £5 pound bet so in total I got about £20, 000 instead of £25, 000. I didn’t meet any of the players or anything like that. I was a bit annoyed that the club didn’t contact me. I was hoping that they might do. But I suppose you can’t have it all. At the celebrations, I did keep thinking, when people who didn’t even know me congratulated me, this isn’t my day, this is Leicester’s day. In a depressing year of politics defined by fear and division, the election of Sadiq Khan as Mayor of London was a rare moment of joy. I first met Sadiq when we were both starting out as young lawyers. Everyone could see he was a precocious legal talent. But what really made him stand out was his unshakeable confidence, not just about his own skills, but about what he could do for his clients. At a time when people like us  —   a British Asian and a   guy, from comprehensive schools  —   were uncommon in the legal profession, he refused to see himself as an outsider: if we showed we had the ability, then we belonged. It was inspiring. That same inspiring confidence and sense of belonging was on display this year. Siren voices asked throughout the campaign whether Londoners were ready to elect a     mayor of Islamic faith. Londoners answered with a resounding “yes” in May. I am honoured to be working with Sadiq again, now as his deputy mayor for social integration and social mobility. I have the chance to help him give others the same opportunities he had, and to ensure Londoners live truly interconnected lives. It has also allowed me to see up close the excitement and energy surrounding his new mayoralty. From surprised commuters sneaking a selfie when they see him on the Northern Line, to business and civic leaders in Paris and Chicago keen to forge new links with London, everyone is enthusiastic about a mayor who so aptly represents the confidence and aspirations of a modern, diverse city. Bill Clinton summed it up when he turned to Sadiq during a discussion in New York and said, “I cheered when I saw you had been elected. We all did. ” London is proud that it voted for Sadiq Khan. And the world is proud of London for doing so. The Vote Leave bus provided the focus for visits. As to the £350m, it was accurate  —   that’s what we’ve lost control over. I hadn’t known Boris before I worked with him on the bus. We’d have this daily meeting and he’d ask, “Are we still on the right track?” I liked that. The greatest criticism I got from Labour party members was not the side I’d taken (they knew my views) it was the fact that I was working with Boris. The outside world assumes we are all   creatures. I think Boris found it difficult. At times it got to him, like it got to all of us. You go out and people shout at you things like “traitor”. It is difficult. What surprises me most now is that the Remain side have not taken ownership of the fact that they have lost. They are still talking about it as if something has gone wrong with the electorate. We are back on an almost daily basis to refighting the referendum. My family is from Bavaria so they understand more the view of people in the UK who are critical of the EU. There were emails during the campaign in which German people made out that I was a traitor to the German   war project. But it has settled since the result. I was at a meeting recently where I explained to people in Germany why the British people voted as they did and they listened and understood. There was a real sadness though. Winning the Palme d’Or for I, Daniel Blake was extraordinary. It was an endorsement and meant distributors were given confidence to show the film, so a lot of people saw it and it couldn’t be ignored. It’s rattled a few cages, which is what we hoped for. Across Europe there are people in comparable situations. When we were researching the script we found people who were feeding their kids biscuits because they had no money. There’s a level of poverty that’s just not talked about. I think that’s something fiction can do that a straight news report can’t. It takes you into people’s inner lives. If the film is to be anything other than a news story that fades, it’s got to translate into political action. The demand for food banks has gone through the roof. A lot of people become homeless. At every screening people put up their hands and say: “It happened to me. ” We heard story after story: when Iain Duncan Smith and others say the film isn’t accurate, they’re lying. We know it is accurate. As the CEO of Women’s Aid, I’ve met women from all walks of life who have been through domestic abuse. Amber Heard’s allegations about Johnny Depp were all too appallingly familiar. What was disappointing was how immediate the backlash was. People were quick to wade in and blame her and accuse her of lying. [Depp denied all the allegations and the case was settled out of court.] When a women makes an allegation of domestic abuse, people tend to pick around for ulterior motives. We saw an increase in women coming forward after The Archers’ abuse storyline, and when Amber went public the numbers of calls to police skyrocketed.  Domestic abuse charities are underfunded and we don’t tend to be the sort of charity that celebrities like to attach themselves to so, in a sense, Amber’s public statement was extremely powerful. womensaid. org. uk, Being in Downing Street on the night of 23 June felt like walking across a path to safety, only to suddenly drop into quicksand. No one was going to pull us out. As I arrived in No 10 that evening, still wearing a “Stronger In”   everyone was nervous, despite people queuing up to say we’d won. The markets were buoyant, pollsters were confident and even Nigel Farage was conceding defeat. The early results put the lie to that. Come 4am it was clearly over. Slumped in his office chair, the prime minister dismissed arguments he should stay on. “It would be miserable. I’d be being prepared for the slaughterhouse. Just waiting for the tap on the shoulder. ” I watched him disappear along the corridor to spend time with his family. When he came downstairs a few hours later, David Cameron said: “Well, that didn’t go to plan!” Of course he cared deeply  —   he was simply trying to lead people through his and their pain in a very English way. After a concession call to Michael Gove, we prepared a speech. He walked out with Sam by his side, the first signal to the world he was going. I turned up the TV in the Private Office and watched with George Osborne. I put my arm around Kate Fall, the deputy chief of staff, who was in tears. As David got to the final sentences about loving his country, we could see he was choking up. What felt like the whole of No 10 was now gathered, and David and Sam returned to a round of applause. He waved his hand to silence everyone, but we refused to stop. After a short speech about loving his team, he disappeared into his office. I could give endless reasons why Remain lost, many of them our fault. But in essence, we thought we were able to take more hits than we actually could. As David told me: “We were asking too many people to vote for an EU they didn’t like and immigration they didn’t want. ” Unleashing Demons: The Inside Story of Brexit by Craig Oliver is available from Hodder  Stoughton £20.

I made excuses. I remember the guilt of feeling that I should be there. So when the opportunity to travel to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from where I live in Pennsylvania came, I jumped in. My grandmother, who I’m very close to, really didn’t want me to go. She was scared for me. I am 28 years old and I have a young son, but it was time I stood up. I arrived to a peaceful protest. There was no violence coming from the protesters, but the police had no issue about having their sticks out and one officer had his gun out and pointed  —   he obviously didn’t see the irony. They were ready to attack us. I wasn’t aware that the space around me had cleared in the moment that this picture was taken, and I wasn’t scared. I consciously made eye contact with the officers. I wanted them to see me, to see my anger. I wanted them to feel what I was feeling, but there was nothing. I was arrested and bundled into a van afterwards and taken to a holding facility, where I was strip searched, put in jail clothes and then taken to a prison. I was there for 24 hours. Nearly six months on, I don’t dwell on what happened that day and I don’t want any praise. It was a moment in time and one I would repeat in a heartbeat. People around the world don’t realise how bad things are for black people in the US. Racism here is so ingrained  —   even under the Obama administration. White people care more about their animals than they care about us. There is a disconnect in the way we are living. The way we are being human. That needs to change. When the Democrats asked us to speak at their convention we huddled together and both our children told us not to do it. They said it would have a terrible backlash. But somebody had to say something. Our niece called us after Trump’s statement banning Muslims, she said: “Should I take my scarf off? I’m afraid. ” My wife Ghazala wrote the speech. I wanted to start by saying: “These are my words. I have not copied it from Mrs Obama,” but she said no, this is not according to the dignity of the occasion. We expected Trump to understand that sometimes if you let things pass nothing will come of them. Things would not have been so blown out of proportion. We were hoping he would simply say, “Well, that’s their point of view” and move on. But he didn’t. There have been so many incidents, mostly against Muslims, in the weeks since the election. That is a source of fear. Suppose you and I are walking and somebody comes to me and says, “Get out of this country. ” Just that statement, especially to children in schools, and women. That’s a very serious concern. Somebody sent me two sets of speeches: Hitler’s speeches made in Germany and Trump’s speeches made in this election. Similar thoughts, similar sentiments: “Immigrants are bad. Immigrants are harming us. They’re going to take over our culture, our race, our country. ” Trump hasn’t made one statement saying: “I’m the president of the whole country now and I want everybody to be heartened and have faith in the constitution, in our democratic values. ” I’m simply saying, people are concerned, hearten them, say something positive. To the last breath my son [Humayun, a US army captain, was killed in Iraq in 2004] was doing something for others. So it is under his spirit, under his grace, his example, that we move forward to care for others. When I came to France last year it was like this, winter and very cold. I slept outside in a place at Calais port and every night would try to get a lift with a big truck into the UK. The French police would fire tear gas and water at us. I have three cousins who live in Manchester and that is where I wanted to go. In Eritrea I was forced to be in the army where there are no wages, nothing to eat and I was beaten. The conditions are very bad. I ran away to find work so that I could send money for my mother, who is alone. I didn’t want to go to the Jungle at first because I was determined the next night I would get through. But then I met a man who saw the crucifix I wear and asked me to come and help build the church. I’m a carpenter so I went. By then St Michael’s was made of cardboard, so we put up plastic and wood that we found around the place. People brought us the tools they had and pieces of cloth for the ground. I met many people who shared my language and my faith. To see the holy pictures and to sing and hear the Amharic songs gave me solace. It was a real beacon of light in dark times. I’m Orthodox, but it was Catholics and Lutherians, Ethiopians and Eritreans and some Afghans who came together in this place of God. We called it St Michael’s for the guardian angel as it was his feast day when we finished. Visitors came from all around the world to see our place  —   from America, Russia and Korea and other places. It didn’t matter that it was not brick, that we had no priest. Hagos Kesete (pictured above) was a student of God who led the services because he had a Bible. I have heard he is now in England. Also the others (who helped build the church) are in England now, I think. I left Calais for Germany because I heard the French police would be coming to arrest us all. Just after I left it was bulldozed. It did not matter that it was destroyed, the church is in my heart still. Always. Hasane Tesfase’s name has been changed to protect his family, We got a call telling us the location of the attack  —   it was another Russian strike. As soon we reached the scene we realised that there were civilians trapped in one apartment. A man was pointing them out. We had to go through another building to rescue them. The first boy we rescued was    Omran. My team mate took him out to the ambulance and sat him on a chair and then rushed back to help rescue the rest of the family. My heart breaks for little Omran, but people need to know this happens every day. Every day we rescue children and families. Every day I meet parents traumatised from losing a child or even not being able to find the body under the rubble. But this time it was caught on camera. To be honest while I care about Omran, Samir or Ahmad, I care about all the massacres that are happening. I care about all the children of Aleppo. I care that we stop these Russian and Regime bombs. This was written shortly after the event. We have tried to recontact Bibars Halabi, but have been unable to due to the current Russian and Syrian army offensive, One of our photographers had been reading reports in Nice Matin that local police had given out the first “burkini ban” fines, so he decided to head to the beach the next morning. As most of the world already knows, there has been a lot of controversy in France on the subject: authorities in 15 towns had banned burkinis, citing public concern following recent terrorist attacks in the country. It was another hot summer’s day and the beach was packed with punters. On arrival, he spotted police fining a woman in Muslim dress, and just 50m away, he could see another woman who hadn’t been fined yet  —   so he set up his camera and waited. It all took no more than five minutes  —   the police walked over, gave the woman in blue a fine and asked her to remove parts of her clothing. She left the beach minutes later. There were reports that beachgoers were shouting support or abuse that day, but that’s not what our photographer heard or saw  —   he says the atmosphere was totally relaxed as the police wandered around. I can’t say what I feel about it personally, as it’s important to remain impartial in our profession, but the photographer didn’t feel the police were heavy handed. What’s interesting to me is how the images are being used: are the police abusing their power, or is this woman disobeying the law? We knew it was going to be hot at the final race of the triathlon world championships. Cozumel is in the tropics and the heat always adds a layer of unpredictability. But the sea was so warm  —   28C or 29C. When we came out of the water there was a stop with ice cold drinks. I’ve never seen that before in a race. It’s unheard of. We got on the bikes and pushed hard to create a leading group of about 10 riders. It was perfect for us. We got off the bikes and started running. With 4km to go, Jonny kicked and looked very easy doing it. We went round a corner with 500m to go and up ahead I could see Jonny begin to struggle a bit. That’s OK, it was only 500m and he had a big gap. Then there was the final corner and with 200m to go I saw Jonny stumble into one of the officials. I don’t really know why I stopped to help him. It was just a reaction. It was pure instinct. I put my arm around him. I knew straight away it was heat exhaustion. I kept telling him what an effing idiot he was as I kept us running to the line, because I knew that’s where the doctors were. It was only as we headed to the finish that I started to think if I got him across the line in second he might still have enough points to win the 2016 world triathlon championship. After we’d crossed the line I started thinking about the rule implications. People began lodging complaints. A jury was called in. And all this was happening while Jonny was in intensive care. It wasn’t until the next morning and I turned on my phone that I saw the enormous scale of the response. It was incredible and so positive. But I’m never going to let him forget he owes me one. I came across the work of architect Gaetano Pesce several years ago and have been hugely inspired by all of his work, but in particular his Project for a Door. It’s the perfect statement on what is so terribly conservative about the city and spaces around us. Can you imagine the provocation it would cause? My work matches Gaetano’s own commitment to new technologies as it was   from a live model. It was painted by Sue Day, who has worked for Madame Tussauds and so her way of working is almost forensic. And here I have to say that it has been really very problematic the piece, at Tate, being referred to as the “Golden Bottom”. It’s not a trophy to be had. The model was Asian, he is not “golden”. Fact always over fiction. There has been a difference between the reception of this work in New York [where it first appeared at the SculptureCenter in Long Island] and in London. The cities are formed by different rules and types of humour. Also, Gaetano’s version was from the early 1970s, a time of iconic and singular imagery. The plethora of selfies now speaks of the difference. Images are very much “Insta”  —   you take it, share it and move on to the next experience rather than pore over it analytically. We mark ourselves in front of the Eiffel Tower, or Niagara Falls, or the butt, to say “We were there, we passed through that moment. ” An art work as barometer: the power of the image Gaetano Pesce first asserted being as important to share as an ideology as a giant butt. Race, gender, class and the future of the monarchy  —   the profound questions of British identity as the nation faces existential   change. So news of Prince Harry’s new girlfriend, Meghan Markle, was the perfect opportunity for the papers to showcase their nuanced grasp of these sensitive issues. “Harry’s New Hottie!”  —   the Sun. But the thing that stood out most for me were the descriptions of a “saucy brunette” a woman “not in the society blonde style” of Harry’s relationships past. What was that supposed to mean? I had to look up the Suits actor myself, and when I did, the penny dropped. Markle is black. The press displayed pictures of her mother  —   an African American “complete with dreadlocks”. “Straight Outta Compton!” said the Mail. It was a case of flaunting a racist message  —   How could a brown girl with a dreadlocked mother from Compton ever be fit to become a British princess?  —   but stopping just short of saying it, to avoid allegations of racism. I spelled it out for the prejudice it was in the Guardian, and was told by other commentators that I was the one bringing race into the equation. But Harry agreed with me. A few days later, Kensington Palace took the remarkable step of publishing a statement condemning the   slurs of the British press. Somebody phoned me and said they’d just seen my image on the Childline advert. It was very upsetting  —   with the killer clown image being thrashed out all over the media, it was being picked up by all of the internet sites just about everywhere. My picture appeared on two American sites promoting killer clowns and last year on BBC Essex. I ended up phoning Childline and getting brushed off by a very irate person who insisted that I was too old, and I had to explain: “I’m not phoning up because I’m a child. ” We eventually got to the bottom of it and managed to get it to stop. The killer clown craze raised the profile of clowning, but definitely not for the best. There are a lot of people who have lost jobs because of it. People cancel because they don’t want clowns. If I met these killer clowns I would have more than just strong words with them  …     It’s basically young men fuelled by testosterone or alcohol out to get five minutes of fame on social media. It’s got nothing to do with clowning at all. We clowns are here to entertain, to make people laugh and not to scare the pants off anyone. I’m hoping that most people can see the difference between an idiot in a scary rubber mask and a clown with a costume and   that looks really good. We didn’t know we were going to win that day in the High Court. As the judgement started to be read out, one of my lawyers, who was sitting behind me, sent a text saying: “You’d better write something now!” The only piece of paper I had in my handbag was a really scrappy one. A friend saw me on telly and sent a text saying: “Gina, is that really the only bit of paper you could find?” It didn’t matter, I just spoke from the heart. I didn’t ever envisage, when I was made chief claimant against the government, what would happen over the following few months, and that I would become the focus of a lot of anger. And that’s fine, but what I don’t appreciate is how this has changed us as a nation. In the 18 months surrounding the referendum, we’ve undone all the advances we’d made with regard to diversity and tolerance over the past 40 years. We’re back to where we were in the 60s. We need to take the heat and emotion out of the Brexit debate. We’ve got to have the best brains, hearts and minds taking us through this. This is not the time for hysteria. We have to have a strategy. We need to talk about realities. I feel sad for everybody that’s come to England and made it their home. We were the envy of the world: a tolerant, inclusive melting pot that made us all better. That’s not the case any more. I’m at the point where my family and I can’t go out. We spend a lot of time at home. It’s just preparation as I do think we’ll win, but the fallout will be enormous. Nigel Farage stuck his neck out for Donald Trump during the election and three days after the vote Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, invited him to Trump Tower to say thank you. We didn’t expect to see the  . No one outside the campaign had seen him. But there were 30, 000 protesters outside so we were locked in for several hours. I met Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, in a corridor and she said: “Shall we go and see the president?” It was as simple as that. We took a private lift to the 55th floor. Trump opened the door and said, “There he is!” and gave Nigel a bear hug. He joked, “Nigel, do you think Brexit or my election was bigger?” He was totally relaxed. We sat in his lounge for 90 minutes, talking about everything and anything. Nigel and Trump shared battle stories. Only they know what it’s like to be attacked and abandoned and to come out the other side. It’s a lonely place. As we were leaving Nigel and Trump were at the door and I said: “I have to capture this moment. ” I took the picture on my iPhone. It’s unique. It’s two happy men realising what they’ve achieved against all odds. They’ve made 2016 a remarkable year and probably changed the course of political history. It’s one of those historic moments you’ll look back on and say: “Did I really take that picture?” We were silent in the lift going down. None of us could quite believe we’d spent time with the  . I showed Nigel the picture and he said, “Oh my goodness. What are people going to think?” I said you have to Tweet it. He said yes and pressed the “send” button. It’s become very valuable. We’re donating the money we make from it to a veterans’ charity, Care After Combat. A copy signed by Nigel raised £10, 000 at an auction. Someone has offered £150, 000 if both men sign it. The term “supermoon” is something that astronomers aren’t terribly happy with as it came from an astrologer and it doesn’t really mean very much. The correct astronomical term is    —   perigee meaning the closest the Earth comes to the moon in its orbit and syzygy when three bodies are in a line in a gravitationally bound system  —   in this case the sun, moon and Earth, in that order. I was at home on the night, but for an astronomer who does a lot of photography the full moon isn’t the best time to take photos as it washes out a lot of the galaxies surrounding it, and also we lose various other things to the moon’s glare, including the Leonid meteor shower which peaked around the same time. That night I was photographing the moon via my garden’s large telescope and in particular the very edge of it as shadows are created and you can begin to see details of the moon’s surface that you can’t see normally. As it’s so bright, my plan was to take pictures of the moon in sections. I ended up with a really   image of the moon made up of nearly 50, 000 images. The end result had sharp bits and less sharp bits because the atmospheric conditions varied so much. Although this year’s moon was large, the moon that we will get on the 2 January 2018 will actually appear much larger. After the election we were all very despondent. It felt like a tragic outcome. I had been downtown and Bill, Hillary, Chelsea and Mark were all in the grocery store, picking up their Thanksgiving dinner. When I spotted Hillary, I went up and introduced myself. I told her how much we admired the campaign and how she was undiminished in our hearts. She made this really sweet, sad happy face and gave me a hug and we took a picture, and she said: “Don’t be discouraged and never give up. ” I had a chance to tell Hillary what I think a lot of people would have wanted to tell her, and I posted the picture thinking it would make people feel better. It got half a million likes, and was picked up by the New York Times, Vanity Fair and Gawker. In the pictures, Hillary looks a little different because she’s not wearing  . A lot of people have said she looks so tired and sad. But, no, I don’t agree. She was so happy to be surrounded by her family. Chelsea came up with her baby, Aiden, and after a while Hillary said, “OK, I need to get into grandma mode now,” and she picked up the baby and left."
"Daniel Jones had always been friendly with the CIA personnel who stood outside his door. When he needed to take something out of the secured room where he read mountains of their classified material, they typically obliged. An informal understanding had taken hold after years of working together, usually during   hours, so closely that Jones had parking privileges at an agency satellite office not far from its McLean, Virginia, headquarters. They would ask Jones if anything he wanted to remove contained real names or cover names of any agency officials, assets or partners, or anything that could compromise an operation. He would say no. They would nod, he would wish them a good night, and they would go their separate ways. After midnight in the summer of 2013, Jones deliberately violated that accord.  Jones, a   staffer, had become the chief investigator for the Senate intelligence committee, the CIA’s congressional overseer, on its biggest inquiry. For five years, he had been methodically sifting through internal CIA accounts of its infamous torture program, a process that had begun after the committee learned  —   thanks to a New York Times article, not the agency  —   that a senior official had destroyed videotapes that recorded infamously brutal interrogations. The subsequent committee inquiry had deeply strained a relationship with Langley that both sides badly wanted to maintain. The source of that strain was simple: having read millions of internal emails, cables and accounts of agency torture, Jones had come to believe everything the CIA had told Congress, the Bush and Obama White Houses and the public was a lie.  There was one document in particular that proved it. Jones and his team had found it years before, placed mysteriously onto a shared computer network drive the Senate intelligence committee investigators were using in northern Virginia, not far from CIA headquarters. But they hadn’t appreciated its full significance until the agency, in an attempt at refuting a report that was still far from publication, told Barack Obama’s staff that the committee was pushing a hysterical interpretation of the agency’s fateful    embrace of torture. The document, prepared for Leon Panetta when he was CIA director, had reached the same conclusions about the torture program that Jones had. As long as Jones had it, he would be able to show that the agency knew full well how brutal the torture was how ineffective its torturers considered it to be and how thoroughly the CIA had covered all of that up.  As long as Jones had the document, that is. Lurking in the back of his mind was the event that had led him to devote five years of ceaseless work, through nights and weekends: the CIA had already destroyed evidence of torture. It did that before the Senate had launched an investigation, and long before that investigation had turned acrimonious.  Inside the small room in Virginia the CIA had set up for the Senate investigators, Jones reached for his canvas messenger bag. He slipped crucial   passages of what he called the Panetta Review into the bag and secured its lock. Sometime after 1am, Jones walked out, carrying his bag as he always did, and neglecting to tell the agency security personnel what it contained. After years of working together, no one asked him to open the bag.  Jones walked to the parking lot until he found his black Porsche Boxster. He tossed the bag onto the passenger seat and drove across the Potomac river, not stopping until he reached the Hart Senate office building on Capitol Hill. It was hours before dawn, but Jones walked into the building, sped to the second floor where the committee did its work, and placed the locked bag into a committee safe.  Jones, by accord, had significant access to classified agency material. He would not be leaking the Panetta Review to the public. He was ensuring its preservation so Congress could exercise its constitutionally mandated oversight on an agency with a vivid recent history of document destruction on precisely this issue. But Jones, in his   interview, acknowledged to the Guardian: “We had crossed a bridge. For the first time we had knowingly violated a CIA agreement. ”  It was an unfathomable turn of events, and it would have severe repercussions. Jones had years of training and experience handling classified material: before joining the Senate committee staff, he was an FBI   analyst. The Senate committee was not favorably inclined toward absconding with intelligence documents: its leadership was spending summer 2013 excoriating NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as a traitor. But, Jones said: “I was afraid [the document] would be destroyed   …     I was the one saying, ‘We have to do this. ’” Jones takes “full responsibility” for taking the document, but will not clarify who actually made the decision. Senators on the committee say they learned about it after the fact rather than directing him to take the document, and support the decision to this day. “I don’t disagree with it. I mean, look, Director [John] Brennan tried very hard to cover up the Panetta Review,” said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and longtime intelligence committee member. The Panetta Review saga would spur a furious CIA to take an extraordinary step: it would spy on its own legislative overseers  —   especially Jones. The episode would spill out publicly the following March, when top committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had already taken a huge political risk in pushing the torture inquiry, accused the CIA on the Senate floor of triggering what she called a constitutional crisis. Both sides requested the justice department pursue a criminal investigation on the other. The bitterness would nearly overshadow a landmark report, a fraction of which was released to the public in December 2014, that documented in chilling detail the depravations CIA inflicted on terrorism suspects after  .  The CIA has stopped defending its torture program but not its personnel. While it has reknit its relationship to the committee, thanks to a GOP leadership that has all but disavowed the torture investigation, it continues to maintain that the torture report is inaccurate. Obama, whose trusted aide John Brennan runs the CIA, kept the report at arm’s length, with his administration declining even to read it.  But the CIA has gone beyond successfully suppressing the report. In a grim echo of Jones’s fears, the agency’s inspector general, Langley recently revealed, destroyed its copy  —   allegedly an accident. Accountability for torture has been the exclusive province of a committee investigation greeted with antipathy by Obama. While Obama prides himself on ending CIA torture, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has vowed if elected to “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”. Key CIA leaders defending the agency against the committee, including Brennan and former director Michael Morrell, are reportedly seeking to run Langley under Hillary Clinton.  This is the inside story of the Senate investigation into torture and the crisis with the CIA it spurred. It is formed from interviews with critical players in the drama, supported by voluminous internal reports and publicly available documents. Jones agreed to provide new details but would not discuss classified information with the Guardian. When it came time for Brennan to talk publicly about the Senate inquiry, long after Jones’s predawn drive, he spent five minutes fitting the CIA’s torturers into the context of  . But   changed Jones’s life as well. A native of central Pennsylvania, Jones, now 41 years old, taught in Baltimore in his early 20s as part of the Teach for America program encouraging service in   schools. After   he recalled, he wanted to influence public policy over the emerging war on terrorism, and sought work on Capitol Hill. An aide to Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader, advised Jones to instead spend several years at a   agency, like the CIA or FBI. The aide would eventually cross paths with Jones in a different capacity  —   he was Denis McDonough, the Obama confidant who would become White House chief of staff. Jones arrived at the FBI in 2003 and spent the next four years there. The bureau was in the midst of a transformation: a generation after Congress had drastically reduced its domestic   functions, following   scandals,   had compelled its   into the business of   homegrown terrorists. Jones set up shop in the   division as an analyst, primarily focused on   and Sunni extremist groups and occasionally traveling overseas for his work. At one point, he was even detailed to the CIA.  But his future in the bureau was always limited, as he wasn’t a special agent, the field operatives who form the heart of the FBI. Sticking to his plan, Jones arrived on the Hill in January 2007, where his intelligence credentials helped find him a place working for Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee.  Rockefeller told the Guardian that while Jones’s FBI experience qualified him to work on   issues on the committee, Jones’s time as a Baltimore teacher attracted Rockefeller’s interest. “His decision to make this contribution before he began his career in national security told me something about his character and it was something to which I could relate. He impressed me then and I have only come to admire him more in the years since,” Rockefeller, who retired from the Senate in 2015, said.  The intelligence committee is a culture all to itself. Unlike most congressional panels, the vast majority of its work occurs in secret. The byzantine rules of classification restrict staffers who might bolster legislators’ knowledge from accessing significant relevant information. Membership, particularly on committee leadership, instantly boosts the profile of ambitious legislators, who become de facto surrogates for intelligence officials on cable news. All of this means that a committee tasked as the primary avenue for imposing accountability on secret agencies faces the   risk of becoming captive to the agencies they oversee.  Each element of the   intelligence community responds to the committee differently. As every intelligence service carries an inherent risk of scandal, they all have an abiding interest in keeping the panel on its side. The National Security Agency, the most powerful and technically sophisticated aspect of US intelligence, tends to send briefers to the Hill who wax loquaciously about the complicated details of its digital surveillance  —   which lends them an advantage over legislators afraid to admit what they don’t understand. The CIA, however, tends to duck uncomfortable questions by telling senators they’ll send responses later, the better to ensure accurate answers, and secure in the knowledge that busy legislators won’t often follow up. Yet its   style tends not to provoke legislators who would prefer a close relationship with an agency many are inclined to see as performing unsavory tasks for the greater national good.  The committee’s internal politics also operate outside the partisan straightjackets that the broader Congress eagerly wears. Aside from the vanishingly few public hearings it holds  —   an annual threat briefing, a budget briefing, nominations for senior intelligence appointees  —   its work occurs in secret. That secrecy prevents the public from knowing the overwhelming amount of activity about its intelligence services. It also affords committee members the leeway to take positions in tensions with party leadership or to ask questions of intelligence briefers that don’t track conveniently with what their more ideological constituents would prefer. While there is a limit to how bipartisan or   the committee will behave  —   former staffers are quick to point out that their work still occurs on the   Hill  —   both senators and staff describe the   committee work as a venue where unity concerning national security can occur.  “It’s absolutely what people hope Congress is,” Jones recalled.  The torture report began in such a manner.  In November 2005, a senior CIA official named Jose Rodriguez destroyed 92 videotapes depicting the brutal 2002 interrogations of two detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abdel Rahim Nashiri. Rodriguez’s tapes destruction remained a secret to his congressional overseers for two years, until a 6 December 2007 New York Times article revealed it they barely even knew the CIA taped interrogations at all. Outrage was swift and, while tilted toward the Democrats, bipartisan, to include the éminences grises of the   commission. Even the US justice department began an ultimately fruitless inquiry. The Senate committee, then controlled by the Democrat Rockefeller, demanded an explanation.  Michael Hayden, the CIA director, provided an assurance. The CIA did not destroy evidence, Hayden told them, because the agency had extensive records of the interrogations, from field cables, memoranda and internal emails. It was the first time the committee had learned about the documentation of one of the agency’s major operations. Jones, a committee lawyer named Alissa Starzak and two Republican staffers were tasked with combing through Langley archives and documenting what would have been on the destroyed tapes.  Both Jones and Starzak  —   who declined comment to the Guardian  —   knew they would be looking through a soda straw. (The GOP staffers stopped coming to Langley after two or three visits, Jones recalls.) The material they reviewed covered only April to December of 2002. It occurred around only one black site, in Thailand, and concerned just two detainees. The heavily redacted material went only one way: cables back to headquarters, containing nothing about what agency leaders instructed their field operatives to do. Yet the material was extensive: the paper documents the agency permitted the staffers to see looked to Jones like an Encyclopedia Britannica. What they found, over a half a year’s work examining just two detainees’ interrogations from the first year of the torture program, shocked them. It was widely known by 2008 that Abu Zubaydah was tortured. But Jones and Starzak did not expect to see internal accounts detailing, by the minute, what the CIA did to him. They didn’t know, for instance, that interrogators had tortured him to the point that he would obey, like a dog, when they would snap their fingers, nor that they left a man suspected of knowing  ’s secrets alone for 47 days. The cables describe Abu Zubaydah as kept naked, filthy, stinking, shaking with fear, shoved inside a   wooden box, defecating on himself. Agency personnel, in the official communications, get emotional and request transfers rather than continue torturing men they come to believe lack relevant information on terrorism. It immediately raised the question of what the CIA was really doing to dozens of other detainees at its black sites.  “I don’t think the CIA even knew what they were giving us, to be honest,” Jones said.  “These cables were the most graphic of all the cables to exist. Later on, as you go through the program, the cables get less and less detailed. To the credit of the agency personnel who were working on it, they were very detailed.   …     Everything that we were told was basically the opposite of what happened. ”  That detail gave Jones his first recognition of the gulf between what the CIA actually did and what it told everyone outside of Langley that it did. Jones ended up creating a   Microsoft Excel spreadsheet of the early days of CIA torture.  Behind closed doors in the Hart building, Jones presented his findings to the committee on 11 February 2009. Both Republicans and Democrats were shocked by “the incredible brutality of the program at a level beyond which anybody imagined,” Jones said.  “At the back of the report, for what we called the ‘tapes investigation’ the staff created a chart that depicted the most torturous 17 days of Abu Zubaydah’s interrogation. It was almost a    chronology of what the CIA was doing to Abu Zubaydah, and how Abu Zubaydah reacted,” recalled Rockefeller.  “I think everyone on the committee  —   Democrat and Republican alike  —   was quite taken by this section of the report. It was hard to deny the ineffectiveness of the CIA interrogations, the brutality, or the fact that the committee had been deeply misled by the CIA. ” Some senators, particularly Republicans, were taken aback at the idea that the CIA would perform such acts. But Jones’s presentations that CIA interrogators knew the torture was useless  —   contradicting years of agency spin  —   did not attract significant interest from the senators. “To me, I thought that’s what people would be taken with  —   holy shit, we’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said. “But what they were really taken with was the brutality.   …     There was a bipartisan consensus that this can’t be the end, there’s got to be a final product, there’s got to be more here. ”  Less than a month later, on 5 March 2009, the committee voted   to expand the investigation, the dissenting vote being Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss. Instead of examining Rodriguez’s destruction of the videotapes, now the Senate committee would investigate the entire torture program. Part of Jones’s new mandate was to assess whether the CIA “accurately described” its torture program within the Bush administration and to Congress. Still, some of the Republican members imposed limits on the investigation’s scope: Jones couldn’t look at the Bush White House, just the CIA.  The announced inquiry came at an uncomfortable time for the CIA and the White House. Since Obama won the presidency in November, human rights groups had spent four months pressing for a reckoning with torture. While Obama shut down the torture program on his second day in office, he also said that his focus as president would be to “look forward as opposed to looking backwards”. A senior campaign aide and former senior CIA official, John Brennan, became his chief White House adviser for   a signal that Obama did not wish to have antagonistic relations with Langley. His choice for CIA director, after Brennan’s equivocations on torture raised red flags for liberals, was Leon Panetta, a longtime Democratic congressman and consummate insider.  Obama’s eagerness to turn the page on torture alarmed some of his allies. The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate judiciary committees, Patrick Leahy and John Conyers, were pushing for broad investigations into both torture and mass surveillance.  In February 2009, Antonio Taguba, the army major general who blew the whistle on Abu Ghraib, joined a coalition of 18 human rights groups pressing Obama and the Democratic Congress for an independent truth commission on torture. They had support from very senior Democratic legislators, including House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy and House judiciary chairman John Conyers. Activists petitioned attorney general Eric Holder to appoint a special prosecutor for the agency.  If the White House and the CIA didn’t like the intelligence committee looking into the CIA’s recent past, they would like an unpredictable     panel and an independent prosecutor far less. The secretive panel, with its longstanding ties to Langley and its Democratic leadership, seemed like a safer option. An added political benefit was the committee’s new chair: Dianne Feinstein of California, who had a long history of disappointing liberals over national security. Still, the CIA had some caveats.  Usually, when the Senate committee investigates the intelligence agencies, it does so on its home territory. The business of the committee, to include investigations, occurs in secure, locked rooms at the Hart building. Members and staff leave their phones outside staff who lack the appropriate security clearances do not enter. The entire premise of the intelligence committees, established in the 1970s, was their unique fitness within Congress to handle classified material in order to provide accountability on secret agencies. Panetta wanted a different arrangement. The CIA was forecasting the provision of between three and six million pages of relevant documents. Panetta’s aides voiced concern that they could not abide names of operatives, locations of black sites and countries cooperating in the torture program transiting to Capitol Hill. Either the committee would have to wait on the delivery of the documents until after the agency painstakingly redacted its material  —   a process with no defined endpoint and likely to last months, if not years  —   or it could set up shop in a satellite CIA facility in northern Virginia.  “Every other investigation the committee conducted when I was chairman was done from the intelligence committee’s offices  —   offices that are fully secured and certified to hold the most sensitive and classified information that exists,” said Rockefeller.  “The CIA’s detention and interrogation program was the exception. ”  The proposed arrangement discomfited the committee. Both Jones and Louis Tucker, the GOP staff director, agreed that the investigation should unfold in the Hart building, the same as any the panel would conduct.  Feinstein was giving their concerns teeth. Her meetings with Panetta, whose “intelligence and integrity” she praised in his confirmation hearing that February, showed a hard edge. Behind closed doors, in early June, Feinstein pressed Panetta for access to documents. Panetta, a salty politician, raised his voice, referenced their long history together, and said she was asking for unprecedented access. Feinstein raised hers back, and threatened to send subpoenas to the CIA. Here were two fixtures of decades of California Democratic politics, sizing each other up to determine who would dominate whom. But the committee had to consider the reality of the task it was confronting. It had taken over a year to investigate just two interrogations related to the tapes, and in truth, primarily one, as Nashiri did not come into CIA custody at the Thai black site until December 2002, the tail end of the period Jones and Starzak investigated. The CIA did not produce any documents until the middle of 2008. How much time would they lose if they waited for the agency to redact at least 3m documents concerning more than 100 detainees?  The CIA offer came to look acceptable. Jones and his team would drive out to the satellite location. They would have an office, lit bright white and windowless, in its basement. While there, Jones believed, they would receive access to a computer network, known as RDINet  —   for “Rendition, Detention and Interrogation”  —   hived off from the internet, accessible to them alone, onto which the CIA would place the documents. It was unusual, but they found, compared to the alternatives, they could live with it. Jones’s team set to work at the site on 18 May.  Days later, Panetta and Feinstein came to a final agreement on access. Several letters document their accord, with a final one from Panetta on 12 June saying “an agreement was reached between CIA and SSCI staff personnel regarding operating procedures for the SSCI review of material related to the CIA’s detention and interrogation programs. ” The letter said the CIA would establish “a   network  ” that only the Senate staff would access for work, and that “CIA access to the walled off network shared drive will be limited to CIA information technology staff, except as authorized by the committee or its staff. ” An earlier accord, dated 28 May, also referred to establishing a “  [that] can be segregated with only SSCI access and   CIA IT administrators, except as otherwise authorized by SSCI. ” That document was titled Memorandum of Understanding Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s Review of CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program  —   something agency reviews would later claim, as controversy over the inquiry reached a crisis point, did not exist. Ironically for an agency whose concerns were premised on security breaches, now it had to hire IT contractors to set up the network for the committee staff. Documents did not actually arrive until 22 June, and then, they were maddeningly difficult to search through, as the agency insisted on using an obscure and not terribly functional search tool. The staff the CIA posted to liaise with the investigators were “openly hostile” Jones said, and dragged their feet on responding to Jones’s concerns. Then the CIA was hit by what seemed like a bombshell. In August 2009, US attorney general Eric Holder expanded the remit of the prosecutor looking at the tapes destruction, John Durham, to include the torture program, much as the Senate committee had. The justice department’s new mandate was not as broad as the Senate’s. It would only concern itself with torture that exceeded the boundaries set for the CIA by the   justice department. Still, for all of Obama’s emphasis on looking forward and not backward, now the CIA had to face its greatest fear since launching the torture program: possible prosecution.  Holder’s decision, ironically, would ultimately hinder the committee more than the CIA, and lead to a criticism that the agency would later use as a cudgel against the Senate.  Typically, when the justice department and congressional inquiries coincide, the two will communicate in order to deconflict their tasks and their access. In the case of the dual torture investigations, it should have been easy: Durham’s team accessed CIA documents in the exact same building that Jones’s team did.  But every effort Jones made to talk with Durham failed. “Even later, he refused to meet with us,” Jones said.  Through a spokesman, Durham, an assistant US attorney in Connecticut, declined to be interviewed for this story. The lack of communication had serious consequences. Without Durham specifying who at CIA he did and did not need to interview, Jones could interview no one, as the CIA would not make available for congressional interview people potentially subject to criminal penalty. Jones could not even get Durham to confirm which agency officials prosecutors had no interest in interviewing. “Regrettably, that made it difficult for our committee to do interviews. So the judgment was, use the record,” said Wyden, the Oregon Democrat on the panel. But when the Senate investigators discovered discrepancies between what the cables they read indicated and what CIA leaders represented internally or publicly, they would be unable to solicit answers from the people in question.  Durham’s investigation led to the first partisan break on the committee. The committee’s   and top Republican, Kit Bond of Missouri, informed Feinstein that GOP members and staff were withdrawing. The special prosecutor had put the committee  —   and CIA officials  —   in an untenable position, Bond said publicly on 25 September: “What current or former CIA employee would be willing to gamble his freedom by answering the committee’s questions?” By then, the Republican staff had largely withdrawn from the investigation already, with many not bothering to show up to the Virginia facility. Feinstein had already complained about that to Bond in early April. And other strains were evident in the committee’s bipartisanship: a top Republican aide, Kathleen Rice, maintained it would be too onerous to require the CIA to list for the investigators all its   detainees. Bond did not stop at withholding Republican support for the investigation. In early April 2010, Feinstein, frustrated with the lack of access to agency personnel, wrote to Panetta requesting interviews. It was a preliminary step: at that point, she sought little more than Panetta’s assurance to begin processing interviews on the committee’s behalf.  Bond rejected Feinstein’s request  —   not only in a letter to her two weeks later, but in a letter to Panetta a few days after that, urging him not to make CIA officials available to the committee. His stated rationale was the same: steering agency employees out of criminal danger. But as Bond also objected to document requests of the sort Panetta had already agreed to provide, Jones suspected other motives. Jones had lost the support of the committee Republicans. “At this point, they’re working on behalf of CIA,” he said. Bond did not reply to a request for an interview. Panetta, and his successors, never approved any interviews the committee sought with agency personnel. It wasn’t only officials involved in the program who were constrained in speaking with Jones. In October 2009, during a visit to Langley, Jones sought to interview staff from the inspector general’s office, which had investigated interrogations in 2004. Stephen Preston, the CIA’s lead attorney, stood in the hallway outside his office and insisted he be able to attend the meeting, explicitly to monitor what they discussed on behalf of Panetta. Voices were raised, and Jones’s team marched out of Langley rather than hold the meeting on those terms. Preston  —   who declined comment to the Guardian  —   finally relented, and an unmonitored meeting occurred the following month.  “When Director Panetta agreed to provide [the committee] with unprecedented access to CIA documents to pursue its review, the Office of General Counsel was established as the sole conduit for requests and responses to the committee,” said CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani. “There was a meeting with [committee] staff and OIG where the General Counsel participated in that role. It is our understanding that when topics moved to issues unrelated to the review, the General Counsel left and the meeting between [committee] staff and the OIG proceeded. ” Jones’s fight with the CIA was just beginning.  It turned out that those contractors the committee thought the CIA hired to aid in collecting responsive documents were also acting as gatekeepers. They would review torture documents three times before disseminating them to the investigators to determine not only relevance, but whether   ought to make the call to turn them over. In some cases, the chain went up to the White House, to review for executive privilege  —   advisory conversations with White House staff, a broad category that typically keeps a record within the hands of an administration. White House counsel Greg Craig, his successor Bob Bauer, and Don Verilli were involved in the review, with their colleague Kate Shaw trekking to the   location. The attorneys would describe the documents flagged for them to Jones and Starzak, case by case, and ask if they were interested in them. In several cases, the volume of documents meant the CIA had already unwittingly turned over copies of documents flagged for executive privilege review  —   and, once informed of that, the White House attorneys would roll their eyes and move on. The White House involvement helped Feinstein navigate the first outright crisis in   relations over the torture inquiry. In March 2010 Jones and his colleagues started noticing that they had difficulty accessing documents they knew they already had. Simple search terms weren’t retrieving certain records anymore.  “We noticed they were gone right away,” Jones said.  It would have been easy to disappear documents, even in substantial amounts. The agency had provided millions of pages. The only way it could have happened was for the agency to have removed the information from a computer network the CIA set up for the Senate that Jones did not know the agency could access.  Confronted, the CIA pointed to the tech consultants. Then they pointed the finger at the White House, suggesting that Obama’s attorneys ordered them to remove the documents  —   a much bigger accusation, with serious implications. Feinstein, alarmed, turned to the White House, and on 12 March, Jones met with White House lawyers, who denied ordering the removal of anything.  In a process that remains opaque to Jones, the CIA investigated internally and, months later, determined they had removed over 900 documents from the committee. It happened twice  —   with another, smaller wave of removals occurring in May, months after Feinstein first brought the issue to the White House. And it was a violation of the agreements the agency had reached with the committee about the conduct of the inquiry. “This really upset us early on, because it would never have happened if we had conducted this investigation like we conducted every other CIA and intelligence community investigation, which is that it happens at our location, on our computers,” Jones said.  Ultimately, new White House counsel Bauer conveyed verbally to the chairwoman that the CIA would not remove any more documents. On 17 May, the CIA apologized to Feinstein as well. The committee never got the removed documents back, but at least had alternate copies of some . “It wasn’t like, we thought, they would enter into our computers and search them, or go through them,” Jones said, with a wry laugh. Around then, the CIA’s contractor staff largely turned over. The new crew were “more cordial, open, informal” Jones remembered. (“Those working relationships were professional and I am unaware of any need for bolstering,” the CIA’s Trapani said.) They dragged their feet on document requests less. Some would even complain, in shared frustration with Jones’s team, that their superiors were taking too long to release material.  Jones attempted to accommodate his CIA counterparts. Agency officials would occasionally come to him, expressing concern that some documents they provided were marginally related to interrogations, but they contained information about ongoing and unrelated operations. Some of them contained material that was especially sensitive, particularly for contemporary agency activities, but didn’t shed significant light on torture. He let them “pull the documents   …     This happened throughout, even up until the very end. ” The agency made other changes that eased the committee’s task. Later in 2010, CIA got rid of the clunky old search tool, following longstanding complaints from both Jones and Durham’s investigators, and replaced the network search function with a Google interface. Easier sifting was “hugely important” Jones said, as the agency kept piling material on.  The year 2010 gave way to 2011 and 2012. Panetta left to run the Pentagon and David Petraeus, the retired general, took his place. Petraeus seemed “supportive” of the inquiry, recalled Jones. Yet as the committee staff worked nights and weekends at the satellite CIA office, some wondered if the deluge of documentation was a tactic to ensure the investigation collapsed under the weight of accumulated material.  Even with the glut of documentation, the Senate team did not have sufficient evidence to give an account of a major aspect of the CIA’s    apparatus: rendition.  Renditions, used before   were extrajudicial transfers of captured people after   a variant, called “extraordinary rendition” sent captives to the custody of allied intelligence services, neither American nor the country of a detainee’s origin. Some of the CIA’s closest rendition partners worked for the world’s most brutal dictators: Syria’s Bashar   Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, Pakistan’s Pervez Musharraf, Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak.  The rendition infrastructure was even bigger than that of the black sites, which the CIA itself ran. More detainees ran through it than the at least 119 held at the black sites. But once detainees moved into a different intelligence service’s custody, the records the CIA retained of them were scant, or secondhand, or both. It posed a problem for an investigation that sought rigorous internal documentation for every claim it would make. The more time the Senate spent attempting to run down rendition leads, the more it would delay its investigation of the CIA’s interrogations and detentions. And after all, the mandate for the inquiry set by the committee was to determine what the CIA did to men it detained, not what its partners did.  “It was a killer not to cover it, but you’ve got to draw a line,” Jones said. Much CIA documentation the committee had referring to rendition amounted to “hearsay” not enough to responsibly present. “Those rendition records don’t involve people who were technically detained by the CIA. These are transients. The records are just not there. ”  But the consequence of that decision was profound. While ultimately the classified version of Jones’s report would contain information on CIA renditions, the vast majority of the CIA’s renditions operations  —   operations that left   numbers of people disappeared, severely wounded, and likely worse  —   have been lost to history.  Among legislators, the inquiry became background noise. Bond had relinquished the   to Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who in 2009 had been the only dissenting vote against launching the investigation. Feinstein, on five different occasions, asked the GOP to rejoin the inquiry, to no avail.  It took until August 2012 for the CIA to cease the bulk document production. (The CIA disputes this, and Trapani said it continued to “facilitate and support” Senate document access until December 2014.) By then, the staff estimated they had the equivalent of two urban libraries. Jones had been writing the classified report incrementally. Starting in October 2011, Feinstein had him send pieces of the report to the committee, Democrats and Republicans, so no one was taken by surprise.  In December 2012, Jones finished the report. It was at that point 6, 200 pages long and entirely secret. In a sign of the diminished partisan consensus around torture, the vote to adopt the report was   with Maine moderate Olympia Snowe the only Republican to assent. Now would come the next fight: to declassify the report.  But since the committee had a more immediate task, Feinstein and the Democrats decided to leverage it. On 7 February 2013, Obama confidant John Brennan had his confirmation hearing with the panel to run his beloved CIA. By now, the CIA had overcome its major fear over torture accountability: Durham’s investigation had concluded in summer 2012 and had prosecuted no one. There would be no criminal accountability for torture, and it was an open question whether the public would ever read Jones’s report. The committee sought Brennan’s attitude toward the inquiry. Brennan equivocated on torture throughout the hearing. Although he was the agency’s deputy executive director when the program began, he minimized his knowledge of it. (A former CIA officer who has long known Brennan and who has since criticized torture, Glenn Carle, told the Guardian: “He has never been a proponent of this stuff. ”) Brennan called waterboarding “reprehensible” but would not, under repeated questioning, call it torture. He promised outright to provide the committee with his “full and honest views” after reading the torture report, but when pressed on declassifying it, said: “I would have to take that declassification request under serious consideration, obviously. ” No response was forthcoming to the declassification request. But on 27 June 2013, the CIA sent a   page response to the committee raising a host of objections to the Senate’s conclusions.  The agency dissented from the conclusion that torture “did not produce unique intelligence that led terrorist plots to be disrupted, terrorists to be captured, or lives to be saved. ” That “flawed conclusion” led to another, the agency claimed: that the CIA “resisted internal and external oversight and deliberately misrepresented to Congress, the executive branch, the media, and the American people” the truth about its torture.  Rejecting an assessment that the agency “misrepresented” the program  —   lied about torture, less euphemistically  —   the agency said: “The factual record maintained by the agency does not support such conclusions. ”  Jones was stunned, and for a very particular reason. For years, he had been in possession of a specific agency document that not only supported those conclusions, it reached them itself  —   what a senator on the committee, Mark Udall of Colorado, would later call a “smoking gun”. The document was the Panetta Review. Much of it remains a mystery to Jones even today: whether he or another staffer found it on the network, whether the agency meant them to receive it, or if an agency whistleblower slipped it onto the Senate drive. Nor does the CIA have an answer to the puzzle: “CIA does not know how [Senate] staff acquired the unauthorized documents,” Trapani said. But Jones recalls discovering it around 2010 and “pretty immediately” understanding its significance.  “When we saw this document, we weren’t like, ‘Oh, great, we got the CIA.’ It was: ‘Oh, Jesus Christ, thank God  —   we’re not crazy,’” he said. “This was high stakes. A lot was riding on it. It was a relief. ”  They called it the Panetta Review because the agency prepared a summary of its renditions, detentions and interrogations work for Director Panetta, who had come to Langley after Obama shut the program down. One version was a Microsoft Word document, clearly a draft, with the function allowing users to see each others’ changes enabled. Another version, apparently more final, was a PDF. Iterations by CIA were clear on view: “You could see the attorneys looking at it and saying, ‘Well, let’s make sure we can back this up, can you add more citations? ’” The final version of the Panetta Review, Jones said, was more than 1, 000 pages long. The CIA has represented it as “summaries of documents being provided to the [committee]   …     highlighting the most noteworthy information contained in the millions of pages of documents being made available,” as agency attorney Martha Lutz would tell a court after Vice reporter Jason Leopold sought to acquire the   document. Jones said that description is incorrect. “It’s a narrative, plain and simple. ‘This is Abu Zubaydah’s interrogation.’ ‘This is KSM [Khalid Shaikh Mohammed].’ They’re topic oriented: ‘These are the inaccurate things we told the president.’ It’s a final findings document. It has 13 findings. And one is, basically, they provided inaccurate information to support the use of EITs,” or enhanced interrogation techniques, the agency’s preferred euphemism for torture. Lutz would later tell a federal court that “even the post polished versions remained drafts and were subject to change”. The CIA stopped compiling the Panetta Review in 2010 after Durham told Preston that CIA risked complicating any prosecution if it “made different judgments than the prosecutors had reached” Charlie Savage reported in his 2015 book Power Wars. Useful as the document was, it took on brand new significance now that the CIA was denying the conclusions that it had endorsed in the Panetta Review.  “I did not think they were going to say: ‘None of this is right, you’re all wrong.’ I expected to receive the Panetta Review,” Jones said. “What’s so shocking about that is that we thought this problem  —   the CIA providing inaccurate information to the president  —   was limited to the Bush administration, to [ ] Tenet, Goss and Hayden. This is John Brennan’s CIA, Obama’s CIA. There’s a famous picture of Brennan briefing the president with their response in May of 2013, before we received their response. They’re providing inaccurate information to the president of the United States in the present day. ”  And the CIA, Jones knew, had a very recent history of destroying videotapes recording torture. It was the reason he had spent five and a half years sifting through the agency’s darkest secrets. Even more recently, the CIA had removed hundreds of documents, surreptitiously and in violation of the understanding the committee thought it reached with the agency, from the Senate files.  Jones walked to his car and drove to the satellite CIA office. His life would never be the same.  Next: ‘A constitutional crisis.’ An incensed CIA spies on Jones. Accusations fly between the CIA and the Senate."
"On 22 June 2015, Xavier Justo, a    retired Swiss banker, walked towards the front door of his brand new boutique hotel on Koh Samui, a tropical Thai island. He had spent the past three years building the luxurious   complex of chalets and apartments overlooking the shimmering sea and was almost ready to open for business. All he needed was a licence. Justo had arrived in Thailand four years earlier, having fled the drab world of finance in London. In 2011, he and his girlfriend Laura toured the country on a motorbike and, two years later, they got married on a secluded beach. The couple eventually settled down in Koh Samui, a tourist hotspot, just an hour’s flight south of Bangkok. After trying out a couple of entrepreneurial ventures, Justo eventually decided that he would go into the hotel business. He bought a plot with an imposing house and began building: adding a gym, villas and a tennis court. That June afternoon, he was expecting a visit from the tourism authorities to sign off on the paperwork. Instead, a squad of armed Thai police burst through the unlocked door, bundling Justo to the ground. The officers tied their plastic cuffs so tightly around Justo’s wrists that he bled on the dark tiled floor. The police quickly moved into his office, ripping out the computers and emptying the filing cabinets. After two days in a ramshackle local jail, Justo was flown to Bangkok and paraded before the media, in a press conference befitting a mafia kingpin. Still wearing shorts and   he was flanked by four commandos holding machine guns, while a quartet of senior Royal Thai Police officers briefed the assembled reporters on the charges against him. Justo was charged with an attempt to blackmail his former employer, a       company named PetroSaudi. But behind this seemingly mundane charge lay a much bigger story. Six months earlier, Justo had handed a British journalist named Clare Rewcastle Brown thousands of documents, including 227, 000 emails, from the servers of his former employer, PetroSaudi, which appeared to shed light on the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from a   Malaysian investment fund known as 1MDB. The documents that Justo leaked have set off a chain reaction of investigations in at least half a dozen countries, and led to what Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, described last week as “the largest kleptocracy case” in US history. According to lawsuits filed last week by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) at least $3. 5bn has been stolen from 1MDB. The purpose of the fund, which was set up by Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, in 2009, was to promote economic development in a country where the median income stands at approximately £300 per month. Instead, the DoJ alleged that stolen money from 1MDB found its way to numerous associates of Prime Minister Najib, who subsequently went on a lavish spending spree across the world. It also accused Najib of receiving $681m of cash from 1MDB  —   a claim he denied. Money from 1MDB, the US also claimed, helped to purchase luxury apartments in Manhattan, mansions in Los Angeles, paintings by Monet, a corporate jet, and even financed a major Hollywood movie. The US justice department breaks the alleged theft down into three distinct phases: the first $1bn defrauded under the “pretence of investing in a joint venture between 1MDB and PetroSaudi” another $1. 4bn, raised by Goldman Sachs in a bond issue, misappropriated and fraudulently diverted to a Swiss offshore company and $1. 3bn, also from money Goldman Sachs raised on the market, which was diverted to a Singapore account. “A number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account,” Lynch told the press last week. “The   laundered their stolen funds through a complex web of opaque transactions and fraudulent shell companies, with bank accounts in countries around the world, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States. ” PetroSaudi, which is not a party to the lawsuit, denied the US allegations and said that the DoJ’s   claims are “no more than untested allegations”. Najib, who has used every ounce of his power to obstruct investigations into the scandal  —   a charge he denies  —   is not mentioned by name in the US lawsuits, which refer to him as “Malaysian Official 1”. But the man at the centre of the intricate swindle depicted in the US lawsuits is an adviser to Najib: Jho Low, a      friend of the prime minister’s stepson. Low, a babyfaced young man who likes to party with Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton  —   and calls his Goldman Sachs banker “bro” according to the DoJ  —   is accused by the US of masterminding the theft of $2bn from 1MDB, which was sent to bank accounts in Switzerland, Singapore and the Virgin Islands. Low has said that he has not broken any laws and was not being investigated. Low’s sidekick is Riza Aziz, Najib’s stepson. Riza produced The Wolf of Wall Street  —   Martin Scorsese’s tale of corruption, decadence and greed  —   and both he and Low were thanked by name in Leonardo DiCaprio’s Golden Globes acceptance speech for best actor. In 2011, Low took a 20% stake in EMI, the world’s largest   company, for $106m  —   in the same year, he bought a $30m penthouse for his father at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, overlooking Central Park. Riza’s Hollywood production company has said: “There has never been anything inappropriate about any of Red Granite Pictures or Riza Aziz’s business activities. ” All this and more is laid out in the US filing, which details claims of an amazing heist, carried out by conspirators who rinsed billions from the people of Malaysia through offshore accounts and shell companies in tax havens such as the Seychelles and British Virgin Islands. The scale of the enterprise echoes Balzac’s maxim that behind every great fortune lies a great crime. The global effort to uncover Malaysia’s missing billions began with Xavier Justo. He leaked 90GB of data, including 227, 000 emails, from his former employer PetroSaudi, an oil services company that had signed the first major deal with 1MDB. (PetroSaudi denies any wrongdoing.) Without these files, there would have been no reckoning. Justo’s connection to PetroSaudi was his long friendship with one of the company’s two founders, a Saudi national named Tarek Obaid. The two men had met back in the late 1990s, when they both partied regularly in the nightclubs of Geneva. By 2006, the two men were inseparable: Justo had become an established businessman, running a large financial services firm, Fininfor, and the owner of a Geneva nightspot named the Platinum Club. Justo regarded Obaid as a “younger brother” and in 2008, lent him $30, 000 and a desk in the Fininfor offices to help start up PetroSaudi. Obaid and Justo were an unlikely pair, brought together by a love of the high life. Justo, the son of Spanish immigrants to Switzerland, did not go to university. Obaid is a graduate of Georgetown University’s prestigious School of Foreign Service. His brother, Nawaf, served as a special adviser to the Saudi ambassador to the UK. Obaid’s PetroSaudi   Prince Turki bin Abdullah, is the seventh son of the late King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, who ruled Saudi Arabia from 2005 until his death in 2015. When Justo left Geneva in 2009, PetroSaudi was little more than a name on a calling card, formally incorporated in London with an address at an anonymous business unit near Victoria. Two years later, it had taken in $1. 83bn. PetroSaudi’s business was access capitalism: opening doors with the help of friends in high places. The basic idea was to capture a piece of the huge oil revenues being generated by   firms in developing countries  —   treasure chests waiting to be unlocked by a firm that was a “vehicle of the Saudi royal family” which could count on the “full support from the kingdom’s diplomatic corps”. PetroSaudi told potential partners that it controlled oil fields in central Asia, which it would put up as collateral to secure cash from state investors. This was the pitch that landed PetroSaudi’s founders a meeting with the Malaysian prime minister in August 2009. Aboard a 92m megayacht off the coast of Monaco, Obaid and Prince Turki spent the day with Najib, his adviser Jho Low, and other members of the prime minister’s family. Snapshots taken at the meeting have the look of a holiday cruise  —   baseball caps and shorts  —   but their discussion was serious business. What resulted was a decision for Low and Obaid to work together on a deal that would allow them both to control   sums of money. Although Low held no formal position in the Malaysian government, he had become a trusted confidant to the prime minister. Despite his youth, Low had been instrumental in working with Goldman Sachs to set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest the revenues of an   Malaysian state. Around the time that Low and Najib went boating with the PetroSaudi founders, the Malaysian central government took control of the wealth fund  —   which was soon renamed as 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and given a mandate to promote economic development in Malaysia. The fund had more than $1bn to spend, and Prime Minister Najib had the sole power to approve investments and to hire and fire board members and managers. Low appeared to facilitate transactions  —   according to the DoJ, he even attended board meetings of 1MDB and acted as a link with the PM. The new fund’s first major deal was signed a few weeks after the meeting with PetroSaudi  —   a $2. 5bn joint venture agreement between PetroSaudi and 1MDB, inked during a visit by Najib to Saudi Arabia in September 2009. The press release said that the joint venture would “make strategic investments in   projects” and “underscored the confidence Saudi Arabia has in Malaysia”. But, according to the US justice department, the deal was merely a “pretence” for “the fraudulent transfer of more than $1bn from 1MDB to a Swiss bank account” controlled by Low  —   “a    with no official position with 1MDB or PetroSaudi”. PetroSaudi has always maintained that all 1MDB funds were paid to entities owned by its shareholders. The   joint venture deal was completed with extraordinary speed  —   in less than a month. Shortly after the yacht meeting, on 28 August 2009, Obaid had introduced Low to Patrick Mahony  —   the company director who handled PetroSaudi’s business affairs. According to documents seen by the Guardian, Low and Mahony met for lunch in New York on 9 September to discuss the joint venture. After dining at Masa  —   a sushi restaurant where the set menu costs $540 a head  —   Mahony emailed Low the next day with an offer: “We know there are deals you are looking at where you may want to use PSI [PetroSaudi]   …     we would be happy to do that. You need to let us know where. ” PetroSaudi said the documents seen by the Guardian are unreliable, stolen, fake and that they have been selectively quoted. Less than three weeks later, the deal was done. PetroSaudi would contribute $1. 5bn in oil and gas assets to the joint venture, while 1MDB would inject $1bn in cash. According to the US court filing, 1MDB transferred $300m into an account belonging to the PetroSaudi joint venture, but the remaining $700m was sent to a Swiss account at RBS Coutts, controlled by a   shell company named Good Star. The US justice department complaint alleges that Jho Low, and not PetroSaudi, was the beneficial owner and sole authorised signatory of Good Star. US authorities claim that officials at 1MDB provided false information to banks about the ownership of the Good Star account in order to divert the $700m. In documents seen by the Guardian, on 30 September 2009 PetroSaudi appears to direct that the $700m be paid into an account controlled by the company  —   but three days later, when the compliance department at RBS Coutts requested further details about the name of the beneficiary account, the address given by 1MDB was the Good Star account. On the same day, 2 October, Low emailed Mahony to say “Shld be cleared soon”. PetroSaudi told the Guardian: “No money put into the joint venture by 1MDB was misappropriated or is missing. Its investment was repaid with profit   …     All transfers from 1MDB were paid with the full approval of the 1MDB board. ” According to documents seen by the Guardian, the Good Star transaction made Obaid, then 32, and Mahony, then 33, very rich men. Records indicate that on 30 September 2009, Good Star agreed to pay $85m to Obaid, which the Seychelles company described as a fee for “brokering services”. The money was deposited into Obaid’s Swiss JP Morgan account. At the same time, emails and legal documents indicate that Mahony was given a contract as “investment manager” for Good Star. On 20 October, Obaid emailed his contact at JP Morgan to request that $33m be transferred into an account belonging to Mahony. Four days later, Mahony began discussions to set up an offshore company to buy a £6. 7m townhouse in Notting Hill  —   and by 12 November, contracts for the house had been exchanged. The former banker created a numbered bank account in Switzerland, and all payments for the purchase were made from this account, via a British Virgin Islands company that Mahony had set up. In response to questions from the Guardian, PetroSaudi said the payment to Obaid was not a brokerage fee and that the transfer of $33m to Mahony had nothing to do with the   joint venture. Laura and Xavier Justo were blissfully unaware of their friend Obaid’s changing fortunes. The couple were sunning themselves on Thailand’s Andaman coast in December 2009 when Obaid rang Justo offering him a director’s position in London with PetroSaudi. He told Justo the company had become an overnight success, but it needed someone who could help it grow. Justo rejected Obaid’s initial offer, but he was eventually persuaded by the temptation of a   “adventure”. According to Justo, Obaid promised him a salary of £400, 000, “millions in bonuses” and the perk of a £   flat in Mayfair, central London. Justo pitched up in London in spring 2010, and by June was a PetroSaudi director. But he was kept out of the lucrative Asian business. Instead, Justo, a native Spanish speaker, was tasked with launching a new operation in Venezuela, and spent much of 2011 flying between London and Caracas. Between September 2010 and May 2011, 1MDB agreed to lend an additional $830m to the joint venture with PetroSaudi  —   bringing 1MDB’s total investment to $1. 83bn. Of these new payments, US officials allege, $330m was paid into the Swiss account they say was controlled by Low, on the basis of a request by Obaid  —   who is identified in the US legal complaint as “PetroSaudi CEO”. Emails and bank records seen by the Guardian suggest that in the nine months from September 2010, Obaid transferred $77m from his Swiss JP Morgan account to his PetroSaudi   Prince Turki bin Abdullah. According to the US authorities, banking records show that in the spring of 2011, Prince Turki also received $24m from the Good Star account controlled by Low  —   and that “within days” $20m from these funds was transferred to an account belonging to the Malaysian prime minister, Najib. Meanwhile, Low was becoming known on the New York club scene as a fixer for the global    —   snapped by paparazzi swigging magnums of Cristal with RB singers and Hollywood stars. According to US authorities, Low spent $100m from the joint venture transactions on properties in Hollywood and $40m on New York apartments. The funding for The Wolf of Wall Street, the US complaint alleges, can be directly traced to the billion dollars diverted from the PetroSaudi joint venture. In the meantime, Justo was growing disaffected with working conditions at PetroSaudi. According to his wife, Laura, the first sign of discontent was his discovery that his salary payments were only about half of what Justo said Obaid had offered him  —   a slight that was compounded when he learned that the promised   bonus would be considerably less than that  —   more like six figures than seven. There were other niggles, too. He complained to Laura that he was often paid late, and sometimes not at all. He claimed that he ended up paying rent on the flat in Mayfair that was supposed to be covered by his employers. At first, Justo told Laura, he thought these were just mishaps  —   nothing malicious, just poor corporate bookkeeping. But he became increasingly dismayed by Obaid’s behaviour. Justo told friends that Obaid had become “arrogant” after striking it rich. Justo was especially disturbed by what he described as changes in his younger Saudi friend  —   telling other people that Obaid had become irrational, and displayed “uncontrollable” rage. Justo and Obaid’s long friendship, stretched to breaking point over 12 months of highly charged corporate life, finally snapped. At the end of 2010, Justo missed a flight for an important meeting. He apologised to Obaid, but according to Justo, his friend “went mad” sending him a stream of abuse, via text messages and emails. Sick with worry, Justo decided to resign in March 2011. In the angry email exchanges that followed, Obaid called Justo “arrogant” and a “smart ass”. In April, things came to a head in Mayfair. Amid the marble, dark leather and metal art deco detailing of the exclusive Connaught hotel bar, Mahony and Justo hammered out the terms of his departure. According to Justo, Mahony had agreed to pay him about 6. 5m Swiss francs (£5m) in severance. However, in the midst of a heated conversation, Mahony’s phone rang. It was Obaid, who apparently told Mahony to settle on 5m Swiss francs (£3. 85m). Justo, who had poured his heart out to Mahony, telling him he was at his “lowest point emotionally” shed tears. A day later, Justo claims that he was told his severance package would, in fact, be 4m Swiss francs (£3m). As the rancour set in, Justo took a copy of the data on the PetroSaudi servers. In September 2013, a little more than two years after he had left PetroSaudi, Justo sent a fateful email to Mahony. Justo was insistent that he be paid what was owed to him, warning that he had a file of information on PetroSaudi. “The official side paints a nice picture but the reality is commissions, commissions, commissions,” he wrote. In the furious exchanges that followed, Mahony accused Justo of blackmail. Mahony presciently told his former colleague: “What troubles me so much is the way in which I see this situation ending  —   with the destruction of you. ” A few months later, over a Chinese meal in London, the journalist who would break open the 1MDB scandal first heard rumours about an extraordinary heist in Malaysia. Clare Rewcastle Brown met a contact at a restaurant in Bayswater who showed her screen grabs of internal documents from PetroSaudi: on a single printed page, there were highlights of PetroSaudi’s dealings with 1MDB, under the heading “Thousands of documents related to the deal (emails, faxes and transcripts)”. She recognised the names and the deal. Her heart skipped a beat. “A bomb went off in my head,” Brown recalled. She knew right away that this was a huge story. Rewcastle Brown is a classic British rebel at the heart of the establishment. She was born on the island of Borneo  —   part of which now belongs to Malaysia  —   when it was still part of the British empire, where her father was a colonial policeman and head of the local intelligence service. Her    is the former British prime minister Gordon Brown. After working as a reporter for the BBC, in 2010 Rewcastle Brown set up Sarawak Report, a website dedicated to uncovering corruption in the place of her birth. Working out of her tiny kitchen in central London, she published story after story exposing corruption in the timber and oil industries that were despoiling the country’s rainforests for profit. Her email was hacked and she received death threats, but she carried on, regardless. Early in 2013, Malaysian politicians labelled her an “enemy of the state”. Rather than be cowed, she considered this a badge of honour. In person, Rewcastle Brown is a curious mix of the bawdy and the brave, almost to the point of recklessness. Her mantra: “I just want the story. ” After the meeting in Bayswater, Rewcastle Brown knew she needed to get the 1MDB documents. The first hurdle was that the source of the PetroSaudi papers apparently wanted millions for the information. It was money she did not have. Another stumbling block was that no journalist in Malaysia wanted to touch the story. In Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib had just won a tightly contested election, and was flush with power. Rumours were swirling around the cache of PetroSaudi documents  —   some said the Russian mafia was behind the data dump, while others speculated that it might be an elaborate trap, set by the prime minister to ensnare his critics. Undeterred, Rewcastle Brown arranged with her contact to meet the source in Thailand. In October 2014, she pitched up at the lobby of the Plaza Athénée hotel, in Bangkok. She had told her husband she was hoping to meet a “balding bespectacled short Swiss guy”. Instead, into the foyer stepped Xavier Justo  —   muscular and 6ft 6in tall. Rewcastle Brown was faced with a “physically imposing, extremely elegant” man. “Oh my God,” she thought. “This guy is going to duff me up. ” But Justo admitted that he was just as scared as she was. According to Rewcastle Brown, he seemed “very, very nervous” and repeatedly warned her that “the people we were dealing with were ruthless, had huge amounts of money and were very, very powerful  —   and they could do what they liked to us”. Justo told Rewcastle Brown that he wanted $2m in exchange for the   documents. It was, he said, the money he should have been paid when he left PetroSaudi. Although he shared a few documents at the meeting, Justo was adamant: no cash, no data. Rewcastle Brown needed to find a rich person prepared to pay for the papers. At around this time, concerns about 1MDB had begun to spread in Malaysia. Financial analysts pointed out that the fund was not generating enough cash to cover interest payments on the billions of dollars of debt it had acquired. The hundreds of millions that had been spent on art work, jewellery, real estate, gambling and parties did not realise any return on the “investment”. By 2014, Prime Minister Najib’s political opponents had taken to taunting him with the accusation that the wealth fund should be renamed “1Malaysia’s Debt of Billions”. In August 2014, Najib received another political blow. Mahathir Mohamad, the towering figure of modern Malaysian politics who served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, announced that he was withdrawing support for Najib, his former protege. In the weeks that followed, Mahathir became more vocal in his criticism, warning that 1MDB was adding to Malaysia’s dangerously high debt levels. This warning went unheeded. The fund’s debt swelled. By November 2014, 1MDB owed almost $11bn. Najib, who chaired the fund’s advisory board, appeared unconcerned, telling the state news agency that the government was not liable for the debt if the fund went bankrupt.  As the crisis deepened, Rewcastle Brown continued her quest for a person willing to pay Justo for the   documents. She noticed that some of the most searching reporting on the scandal had appeared in Malaysia’s   business weekly, the Edge. Sensing that she may have found a wealthy ally, Rewcastle Brown contacted the Edge’s owner, Tong Kooi Ong, a former banker turned media tycoon, who owned a number of business publications. In January 2015, Tong, Rewcastle Brown and Justo met in a   Singapore hotel, the Fullerton. Tong booked a conference room, and brought a number of IT experts, as well as the editor of the Edge, Kay Tat. At the meeting, Justo laid out the 1MDB joint venture, making the same claims that the US Department of Justice would set out 18 months later: namely that hundreds of millions of dollars that were intended for economic development in Malaysia had instead been diverted into a   company. The man at the centre of the transaction was alleged to be Najib’s adviser and family friend, Jho Low. It was a potentially huge scoop. Tong agreed to pay Justo $2m. Tong and Rewcastle Brown were immediately handed disk drives with the data. But the payment was never made. Justo did not want the money in cash, and he worried that a large transfer of funds into his account would look suspicious. Tong offered Justo one of his Monets as collateral  —   but Justo declined, and said “no, I trust you”. Rewcastle Brown finally had the documents she had been chasing for more than six months. On 28 February 2015, Rewcastle Brown posted the first big story online  —   under a typically unrestrained headline: “HEIST OF THE CENTURY!” The article claimed to show how $700m had disappeared from the 1MDB joint venture and found its way into various offshore companies and Swiss bank accounts. The impact of the article was felt around the world. In the US, law enforcement officials who had been alerted to reports that Low was spending huge amounts on New York apartments now had a fix on the possible source of his wealth. While researching the story, Rewcastle Brown had teamed up with the Sunday Times, which helped her decrypt the files Justo had given to her. The paper ran an interview with Mahathir, the former Malaysian prime minister, who called for an immediate investigation and a full audit. “Somebody must be doing something stupid to part with $700m for no very good reason as far as I can see,” he said. In Malaysia, the response was immediate. On 1 March 2015, 1MDB’s management claimed that it had exited the joint venture in 2012, and that it had received back its investment in full, with an additional profit of $488m. PetroSaudi claimed that the $700m had all gone to “  entities”  —   denying, in other words, that companies controlled by Jho Low had received payments in the deal. Not long before Rewcastle Brown’s story broke, 1MDB’s bonds had been effectively downgraded to junk. After another £200m of Malaysian government funds were required to plug a hole in 1MDB’s finances, Najib bowed to the inevitable and ordered investigations by the country’s auditor general and the parliamentary accounts committee. Soon, the country’s central bank and   agency were also looking at 1MDB. Malaysia’s top policeman was reported as saying that the prime minister would also be investigated. Najib tightened his grip on power. As prime minister and finance minister, he wielded enormous authority: in April, the government pushed through harsh penalties and restrictions on free speech, particularly on social media. Five executives of Tong’s The Edge Media Group  —   which had also published details of the PetroSaudi deal  —   were arrested for sedition. The government also introduced a new law, ostensibly aimed at terrorists, which allowed suspects to be detained indefinitely. In July 2015, the Edge weekly was banned from publishing. Although the scandal only seemed to be getting bigger, it had not ensnared Prime Minister Najib personally. Then, on 2 July, Rewcastle Brown and the Wall Street Journal reported that Malaysian government investigators had discovered that $681m from banks, agencies and companies with ties to 1MDB had been deposited in Najib’s private accounts in 2013. A few days later, investigators raided the offices of 1MDB. Najib was now at the centre of a corruption probe relating to allegations that billions of dollars had disappeared from a Malaysian investment fund he controlled. Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, once a supporter of Najib, publicly called on him to answer questions about the fund. It seemed that Najib was cornered. On the morning of Monday 28 July, the attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail  —   a party loyalist who had previously gone after the prime minister’s opponents  —   arrived at his office expecting to finalise corruption charges against Najib. The indictment, which Rewcastle Brown later obtained and published, would have charged the prime minister with corruption resulting from the investigations into 1MDB. The attorney general never got to press those charges. On reaching his office, he was summarily dismissed by a civil servant. In a public statement, Najib said the country’s top legal officer was too ill to continue in the role. Also relieved of their posts were the head of special branch and the deputy prime minister. Meanwhile, four members of the investigating parliamentary accounts committee were promoted, without any choice, to cabinet positions, which left them with no power to continue investigating, and the committee’s work was declared suspended. The next day, a mysterious fire swept through police headquarters, where records of   crimes were kept. It seemed that Najib was in control again. The crackdown revealed a ruthless side to Najib. However, there was a loose end that could unravel everything: Xavier Justo. Not only had Justo leaked information about 1MDB’s dealings with PetroSaudi, he was also a potential star witness in any future court proceedings about the financial scandal. After Justo was arrested for blackmail and flown to Bangkok in June 2015, he was placed in a cell with 70 other prisoners. The floor was covered with sweat and urine, and the room was so tightly packed that prisoners could not sleep on their backs. According to Justo’s wife Laura, her husband’s first foreign visitor was his former friend, colleague and PetroSaudi director, Patrick Mahony. Smooth and charming, Mahony flashed a smile and said he was there to help. Laura says that Mahony offered Justo a deal: confess and plead guilty, and PetroSaudi will get you out of here by the end of the year. Justo reluctantly agreed. He signed a confession  —   without a lawyer present  —   which claimed that he had attempted to blackmail his former employers, and apologised to Mahony and Obaid “for the harm stress and anxiety I caused them”. According to Laura, a man who claimed to be a Scotland Yard detective  —   and later told her he had been hired by PetroSaudi  —   took down Justo’s confession. (PetroSaudi told the Guardian that Justo had “illegally obtained commercially sensitive, confidential and private documentation” and was in prison for “blackmail and extortion”.) Justo was sentenced on 17 August 2015 at Southern Bangkok criminal court. At the trial he was granted a translator, but his lawyer did not turn up, sending an assistant instead. The trial and sentencing took 15 minutes. Justo got three years in a Thai jail for attempting to blackmail a UK company out of $2m. Life behind bars in Klong Prem Central prison, where Justo is incarcerated, is not for the fainthearted. In a city where temperatures rarely drop below 26C, Justo shares a cramped “VIP” cell with 25 other prisoners. Breakfast is at 7am. Water is rationed. Prisoners have no food after 3pm. There is a small bathroom area at the rear of the cell, which consists of a tap and a hole in the floor for a lavatory. As 2015 wore on and it became clear that her husband was not going to be out of jail by the end of the year, Laura grew increasingly suspicious of her contacts at PetroSaudi. A series of stories in the Swiss and Malaysian press purporting to tell Justo’s side of the story depicted him as an unwitting pawn in a political plot against the Malaysian prime minister. Things were not getting better for Justo  —   they were getting worse. In his prison cell, Justo was now sleeping on a thin blanket  —   his mattress was withdrawn a few months after he arrived, as was his exercise hour. Laura came to believe that Justo was a victim of a deceit by his former friends, who tricked him into confessing and handing over copies of PetroSaudi’s servers, in an attempt to protect themselves and their Malaysian associates by burying the case. In May 2016, in a   effort to save her husband, Laura turned to the one person who she knew Justo trusted: Rewcastle Brown, who brought her to the Guardian. When I met Laura in June 2016, she was at first calm and composed, but broke into tears when speaking about her husband, her voice cracking with emotion. Justo has not seen their son since he was eight months old. “I only want justice to be done,” Laura recently wrote in an email. “Xavier was no thief, he was only asking for what he had been promised. Even through this darkest and most difficult time of his life, which is right now, he writes to me that he is keeping strong for our son and I  —   that he will fight for us whatever it takes. ” Since reaching out to Rewcastle Brown and the Guardian, Laura has handed over notes smuggled out of prison in which Justo says he has been framed. Laura believes that Patrick Mahony of PetroSaudi has controlled Justo’s life behind bars, deciding how comfortable his living space would be and who could visit him. (Foreign prisoners have a list posted outside the prison of permitted visitors. Mahony is listed as number two. Laura is number five.) Laura says she has emails and WhatsApp messages, as well as recordings of phone calls from last year that suggest that Mahony is under increasing pressure from Najib, on one hand, and from US and Swiss investigators combing through 1MDB’s deals, on the other. In taped telephone conversations with Laura, Mahony appears obsessed with Rewcastle Brown, whom he refers to as a “bitch”. In a recorded conversation with Laura from November 2015, Mahony refers obliquely to a powerful person whom he claims could help reduce Justo’s sentence: “I told you the other evening, who the ultimate person is controlling this, and I am due to have another meeting with him soon   …     This guy is still stressed because it’s his political career on the line. He’s in deep shit and that’s all he cares about, nothing else. ” When Laura asks what she should tell her husband, Mahony says: “The only way that you can show that you’re on his side  —   to be a team player  —   is if you’re ready to put yourself out in the media. You are ready to denounce all the people who are conspiring against him   …     I am not going to lie to you   …     You can help the situation or you cannot help the situation. ” When Laura presses for Justo’s release, Mahony snaps. “I’m still dealing with this shit every day. You need to remember we are all in the shit. I know he’s in prison and you are alone with the baby. And I looked at you the other day and I told you I feel for you. But me, I’m also in the shit. And a lot of other people are in the shit. A prime minister of a country is in deep shit because he has been put in this shit. ” By December, Mahony admits in another phone call that he had been to the US, where “the FBI is looking at all this shit” and that he had been pulled in by the Swiss attorney general’s office. “The Swiss are continuing to really give us shit   …     They know they have nothing   …     But they say they are fearful of being accused of not doing anything. ” PetroSaudi said that it will cooperate with any official authority in any jurisdiction and added that it is not the subject of any investigation in any jurisdiction. Mahony has not been interviewed by US or Swiss officials. The consequences of Justo’s leaks are still reverberating around the world. When the US Department of Justice laid out the case against 1MDB last week, it pulled no punches. “The Malaysian people were defrauded on an enormous scale,” said Andrew McCabe, the FBI’s deputy director. US officials told the Guardian that any party who wanted to contest the attorney general’s claim must file a response in a federal court within 60 days to answer the factual allegations. In a separate case, the DoJ is also investigating whether Goldman Sachs violated US banking law in its handling of $6. 5bn in bond offerings that it carried out for 1MDB. The Wall Street behemoth earned $593m in fees for the issue. Goldman Sachs denied any wrongdoing. The bank told the Guardian: “We helped raise money for a sovereign wealth fund that was designed to invest in Malaysia. We had no visibility into whether some of those funds may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes. ” Most important was that the DoJ allegations directly contradicted repeated assertions by Prime Minister Najib about the origins and purpose of hundreds of millions of dollars that ended up in his personal bank accounts  —   which he had claimed was a gift from a Saudi benefactor. The DoJ filing was released at a critical moment for democracy in Malaysia. On 1 August, a draconian national security act introduced by Najib comes into force  —   allowing the Malaysian government to establish martial law in any designated geographic area. The law will dramatically expand the powers of Malaysia’s security forces  —   allowing for arrests, searches and seizures without warrants and the bulldozing of buildings. But in the rest of the world, investigations into the sprawling corruption scandal are continuing to expand. In Switzerland, the US justice department identified RBS Coutts and Rothschild Bank as conduits for transactions in the corruption complaint. The Swiss attorney general is probing the   fraud. The banks declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Singapore found “lapses and weaknesses” in    controls at major banks. For the first time in the island state’s history, the authorities shut down a merchant bank. In April the United Arab Emirates froze hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts held by alleged conspirators in the 1MDB fraud and banned the account holders from travelling abroad. The board of 1MDB said that it was “confident that no wrongdoing had been committed” but as a “precautionary measure” its accounts for 2013 and 2014 should no longer be “relied on by any party”. Najib has said that he did not commit “any offence or malpractice”. His attorney general cleared him of corruption earlier this year. For now, the man whose revelations enabled the exposure of this vast fraud remains in a Bangkok prison. Xavier Justo was motivated by a mixture of morality and revenge  —   the desire to settle scores with a friend who betrayed him. To get even, he chose to blow the whistle, for a price. He may not go down in history as a hero who selflessly risked ruin to expose the truth. But in doing so, he did unwittingly sacrifice himself.  • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."
"Three weeks ago, around a quarter of the American population elected a demagogue with no prior experience in public service to the presidency. In the eyes of many of his supporters, this lack of preparation was not a liability, but a strength. Donald Trump had run as a candidate whose primary qualification was that he was not “a politician”. Depicting yourself as a “maverick” or an “outsider” crusading against a corrupt Washington establishment is the oldest trick in American politics  —   but Trump took things further. He broke countless unspoken rules regarding what public figures can or cannot do and say. Every demagogue needs an enemy. Trump’s was the ruling elite, and his charge was that they were not only failing to solve the greatest problems facing Americans, they were trying to stop anyone from even talking about those problems. “The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don’t want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country,” Trump said in one late September speech. “They want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering. ” Trump claimed that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were willing to let ordinary Americans suffer because their first priority was political correctness. “They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else,” Trump declared after a Muslim gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando. “I refuse to be politically correct. ” What liberals might have seen as language changing to reflect an increasingly diverse society  —   in which citizens attempt to avoid giving needless offence to one another  —   Trump saw a conspiracy. Throughout an erratic campaign, Trump consistently blasted political correctness, blaming it for an extraordinary range of ills and using the phrase to deflect any and every criticism. During the first debate of the Republican primaries, Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Trump how he would answer the charge that he was “part of the war on women”. “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals’,” Kelly pointed out. “You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees   …    ” “I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,” Trump answered, to audience applause. “I’ve been challenged by so many people, I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either. ” Trump used the same defence when critics raised questions about his statements on immigration. In June 2015, after Trump referred to Mexicans as “rapists” NBC, the network that aired his reality show The Apprentice, announced that it was ending its relationship with him. Trump’s team retorted that, “NBC is weak, and like everybody else is trying to be politically correct. ” In August 2016, after saying that the US district judge Gonzalo Curiel of San Diego was unfit to preside over the lawsuit against Trump Universities because he was Mexican American and therefore likely to be biased against him, Trump told CBS News that this was “common sense”. He continued: “We have to stop being so politically correct in this country. ” During the second presidential debate, Trump answered a question about his proposed “ban on Muslims” by stating: “We could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. ” Every time Trump said something “outrageous” commentators suggested he had finally crossed a line and that his campaign was now doomed. But time and again, Trump supporters made it clear that they liked him because he wasn’t afraid to say what he thought. Fans praised the way Trump talked much more often than they mentioned his policy proposals. He tells it like it is, they said. He speaks his mind. He is not politically correct. Trump and his followers never defined “political correctness” or specified who was enforcing it. They did not have to. The phrase conjured powerful forces determined to suppress inconvenient truths by policing language. There is an obvious contradiction involved in complaining at length, to an audience of hundreds of millions of people, that you are being silenced. But this idea  —   that there is a set of powerful, unnamed actors, who are trying to control everything you do, right down to the words you use  —   is trending globally right now. Britain’s rightwing tabloids issue frequent denunciations of “political correctness gone mad” and rail against the smug hypocrisy of the “metropolitan elite”. In Germany, conservative journalists and politicians are making similar complaints: after the assaults on women in Cologne last New Year’s Eve, for instance, the chief of police Rainer Wendt said that leftists pressuring officers to be politisch korrekt had prevented them from doing their jobs. In France, Marine Le Pen of the Front National has condemned more traditional conservatives as “paralysed by their fear of confronting political correctness”. Trump’s incessant repetition of the phrase has led many writers since the election to argue that the secret to his victory was a backlash against excessive “political correctness”. Some have argued that Hillary Clinton failed because she was too invested in that close relative of political correctness, “identity politics”. But upon closer examination, “political correctness” becomes an impossibly slippery concept. The term is what Ancient Greek rhetoricians would have called an “exonym”: a term for another group, which signals that the speaker does not belong to it. Nobody ever describes themselves as “politically correct”. The phrase is only ever an accusation. If you say that something is technically correct, you are suggesting that it is wrong  —   the adverb before “correct” implies a “but”. However, to say that a statement is politically correct hints at something more insidious. Namely, that the speaker is acting in bad faith. He or she has ulterior motives, and is hiding the truth in order to advance an agenda or to signal moral superiority. To say that someone is being “politically correct” discredits them twice. First, they are wrong. Second, and more damningly, they know it. If you go looking for the origins of the phrase, it becomes clear that there is no neat history of political correctness. There have only been campaigns against something called “political correctness”. For 25 years, invoking this vague and   enemy has been a favourite tactic of the right. Opposition to political correctness has proved itself a highly effective form of  . It transforms the political landscape by acting as if it is not political at all. Trump is the deftest practitioner of this strategy yet. Most Americans had never heard the phrase “politically correct” before 1990, when a wave of stories began to appear in newspapers and magazines. One of the first and most influential was published in October 1990 by the New York Times reporter Richard Bernstein, who warned  —   under the headline “The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct”  —   that the country’s universities were threatened by “a growing intolerance, a closing of debate, a pressure to conform”. Bernstein had recently returned from Berkeley, where he had been reporting on student activism. He wrote that there was an “unofficial ideology of the university” according to which “a cluster of opinions about race, ecology, feminism, culture and foreign policy defines a kind of ‘correct’ attitude toward the problems of the world”. For instance, “Biodegradable garbage bags get the PC seal of approval. Exxon does not. ” Bernstein’s alarming dispatch in America’s paper of record set off a chain reaction, as one mainstream publication after another rushed to denounce this new trend. The following month, the Wall Street Journal columnist Dorothy Rabinowitz decried the “brave new world of ideological zealotry” at American universities. In December, the cover of Newsweek  —   with a circulation of more than 3 million  —   featured the headline “THOUGHT POLICE” and yet another ominous warning: “There’s a ‘politically correct’ way to talk about race, sex and ideas. Is this the New Enlightenment  —   or the New McCarthyism?” A similar story graced the cover of New York magazine in January 1991  —   inside, the magazine proclaimed that “The New Fascists” were taking over universities. In April, Time magazine reported on “a new intolerance” that was on the rise across campuses nationwide. If you search ProQuest, a digital database of US magazines and newspapers, you find that the phrase “politically correct” rarely appeared before 1990. That year, it turned up more than 700 times. In 1991, there are more than 2, 500 instances. In 1992, it appeared more than 2, 800 times. Like Indiana Jones movies, these pieces called up enemies from a melange of old wars: they compared the “thought police” spreading terror on university campuses to fascists, Stalinists, McCarthyites, “Hitler Youth” Christian fundamentalists, Maoists and Marxists. Many of these articles recycled the same stories of campus controversies from a handful of elite universities, often exaggerated or stripped of context. The New York magazine cover story opened with an account of a Harvard history professor, Stephan Thernstrom, being attacked by overzealous students who felt he had been racially insensitive: “Whenever he walked through the campus that spring, down Harvard’s brick paths, under the arched gates, past the fluttering elms, he found it hard not to imagine the pointing fingers, the whispers. Racist. There goes the racist. It was hellish, this persecution. ” In an interview that appeared soon afterwards in The Nation, Thernstrom said the harassment described in the New York article had never happened. There had been one editorial in the Harvard Crimson student newspaper criticising his decision to read extensively from the diaries of plantation owners in his lectures. But the description of his harried state was pure “artistic licence”. No matter: the image of college students conducting witch hunts stuck. When Richard Bernstein published a book based on his New York Times reporting on political correctness, he called it Dictatorship of Virtue: Multiculturalism and the Battle for America’s Future  —   a title alluding to the Jacobins of the French Revolution. In the book he compared American college campuses to France during the Reign of Terror, during which tens of thousands of people were executed within months. None of the stories that introduced the menace of political correctness could pinpoint where or when it had begun. Nor were they very precise when they explained the origins of the phrase itself. Journalists frequently mentioned the Soviets  —   Bernstein observed that the phrase “smacks of Stalinist orthodoxy” —   but there is no exact equivalent in Russian. (The closest would be “ideinost” which translates as “ideological correctness”. But that word has nothing to do with disadvantaged people or minorities.) The intellectual historian LD Burnett has found scattered examples of doctrines or people being described as “politically correct” in American communist publications from the 1930s  —   usually, she says, in a tone of mockery. The phrase came into more widespread use in American leftist circles in the 1960s and 1970s  —   most likely as an ironic borrowing from Mao, who delivered a famous speech in 1957 that was translated into English with the title “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People”. Ruth Perry, a literature professor at MIT who was active in the feminist and civil rights movements, says that many radicals were reading the Little Red Book in the late 1960s and 1970s, and surmises that her friends may have picked up the adjective “correct” there. But they didn’t use it in the way Mao did. “Politically correct” became a kind of   among American leftists  —   something you called a fellow leftist when you thought he or she was being  . “The term was always used ironically,” Perry says, “always calling attention to possible dogmatism. ” In 1970, the   author and activist Toni Cade Bambara, used the phrase in an essay about strains on gender relations within her community. No matter how “politically correct” her male friends thought they were being, she wrote many of them were failing to recognise the plight of black women. Until the late 1980s, “political correctness” was used exclusively within the left, and almost always ironically as a critique of excessive orthodoxy. In fact, some of the first people to organise against “political correctness” were a group of feminists who called themselves the Lesbian Sex Mafia. In 1982, they held a “Speakout on Politically Incorrect Sex” at a theatre in New York’s East Village  —   a rally against fellow feminists who had condemned pornography and BDSM. Over 400 women attended, many of them wearing leather and collars, brandishing nipple clamps and dildos. The writer and activist Mirtha Quintanales summed up the mood when she told the audience, “We need to have dialogues about SM issues, not about what is ‘politically correct, politically incorrect’. ” By the end of the 1980s, Jeff Chang, the journalist and   critic, who has written extensively on race and social justice, recalls that the activists he knew then in the Bay Area used the phrase “in a jokey way  —   a way for one sectarian to dismiss another sectarian’s line”. But soon enough, the term was rebranded by the right, who turned its meaning inside out. All of a sudden, instead of being a phrase that leftists used to check dogmatic tendencies within their movement, “political correctness” became a talking point for neoconservatives. They said that PC constituted a leftwing political programme that was seizing control of American universities and cultural institutions  —   and they were determined to stop it. The right had been waging a campaign against liberal academics for more than a decade. Starting in the   a handful of conservative donors had funded the creation of dozens of new thinktanks and “training institutes” offering programmes in everything from “leadership” to broadcast journalism to   fundraising. They had endowed fellowships for conservative graduate students, postdoctoral positions and professorships at prestigious universities. Their stated goal was to challenge what they saw as the dominance of liberalism and attack   tendencies within the academy. Starting in the late 1980s, this   conservative movement entered the mainstream with a series of improbable bestsellers that took aim at American higher education. The first, by the University of Chicago philosophy professor Allan Bloom, came out in 1987. For hundreds of pages, The Closing of the American Mind argued that colleges were embracing a shallow “cultural relativism” and abandoning   disciplines and standards in an attempt to appear liberal and to pander to their students. It sold more than 500, 000 copies and inspired numerous imitations. In April 1990, Roger Kimball, an editor at the conservative journal, The New Criterion, published Tenured Radicals: How Politics Has Corrupted our Higher Education. Like Bloom, Kimball argued that an “assault on the canon” was taking place and that a “politics of victimhood” had paralysed universities. As evidence, he cited the existence of departments such as African American studies and women’s studies. He scornfully quoted the titles of papers he had heard at academic conferences, such as “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl” or “The Lesbian Phallus: Does Heterosexuality Exist?” In June 1991, the young Dinesh D’Souza followed Bloom and Kimball with Illiberal Education: the Politics of Race and Sex on Campus. Whereas Bloom had bemoaned the rise of relativism and Kimball had attacked what he called “liberal fascism” and what he considered frivolous lines of scholarly inquiry, D’Souza argued that admissions policies that took race into consideration were producing a “new segregation on campus” and “an attack on academic standards”. The Atlantic printed a 12, 000 word excerpt as its June cover story. To coincide with the release, Forbes ran another article by D’Souza with the title: “Visigoths in Tweed. ” These books did not emphasise the phrase “political correctness” and only D’Souza used the phrase directly. But all three came to be regularly cited in the flood of   articles that appeared in venues such as the New York Times and Newsweek. When they did, the authors were cited as neutral authorities. Countless articles uncritically repeated their arguments. In some respects, these books and articles were responding to genuine changes taking place within academia. It is true that scholars had become increasingly sceptical about whether it was possible to talk about timeless, universal truths that lay beyond language and representation. European theorists who became influential in US humanities departments during the 1970s and 1980s argued that individual experience was shaped by systems of which the individual might not be aware  —   and particularly by language. Michel Foucault, for instance, argued that all knowledge expressed historically specific forms of power. Jacques Derrida, a frequent target of conservative critics, practised what he called “deconstruction” rereading the classics of philosophy in order to show that even the most seemingly innocent and straightforward categories were riven with internal contradictions. The value of ideals such as “humanity” or “liberty” could not be taken for granted. It was also true that many universities were creating new “studies departments” which interrogated the experiences, and emphasised the cultural contributions of groups that had previously been excluded from the academy and from the canon: queer people, people of colour and women. This was not so strange. These departments reflected new social realities. The demographics of college students were changing, because the demographics of the United States were changing. By 1990, only   of Americans under 18 were white. In California, the freshman classes at many public universities were “majority minority” or more than 50%  . Changes to undergraduate curriculums reflected changes in the student population. The responses that the conservative bestsellers offered to the changes they described were disproportionate and often misleading. For instance, Bloom complained at length about the “militancy” of African American students at Cornell University, where he had taught in the 1960s. He never mentioned what students demanding the creation of African American studies were responding to: the biggest protest at Cornell took place in 1969 after a cross burning on campus, an open KKK threat. (An arsonist burned down the Africana Studies Center, founded in response to these protests, in 1970.) More than any particular obfuscation or omission, the most misleading aspect of these books was the way they claimed that only their adversaries were “political”. Bloom, Kimball, and D’Souza claimed that they wanted to “preserve the humanistic tradition” as if their academic foes were vandalising a canon that had been enshrined since time immemorial. But canons and curriculums have always been in flux even in white   there has never been any one stable tradition. Moby Dick was dismissed as Herman Melville’s worst book until the  . Many universities had only begun offering literature courses in “living” languages a decade or so before that. In truth, these crusaders against political correctness were every bit as political as their opponents. As Jane Mayer documents in her book, Dark Money: the Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right, Bloom and D’Souza were funded by networks of conservative donors  —   particularly the Koch, Olin and Scaife families  —   who had spent the 1980s building programmes that they hoped would create a new “ ”. (The New Criterion, where Kimball worked, was also funded by the Olin and Scaife Foundations.) In his 1978 book A Time for Truth, William Simon, the president of the Olin Foundation, had called on conservatives to fund intellectuals who shared their views: “They must be given grants, grants, and more grants in exchange for books, books, and more books. ” These skirmishes over syllabuses were part of a broader political programme  —   and they became instrumental to forging a new alliance for conservative politics in America, between white   voters and small business owners, and politicians with corporate agendas that held very little benefit for those people. By making fun of professors who spoke in language that most people considered incomprehensible (“The Lesbian Phallus”) wealthy Ivy League graduates could pose as  . By mocking courses on writers such as Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, they made a racial appeal to white people who felt as if they were losing their country. As the 1990s wore on, because multiculturalism was associated with globalisation  —   the force that was taking away so many jobs traditionally held by white   people  —   attacking it allowed conservatives to displace responsibility for the hardship that many of their constituents were facing. It was not the slashing of social services, lowered taxes, union busting or outsourcing that was the cause of their problems. It was those foreign “others”. PC was a useful invention for the Republican right because it helped the movement to drive a wedge between   people and the Democrats who claimed to speak for them. “Political correctness” became a term used to drum into the public imagination the idea that there was a deep divide between the “ordinary people” and the “liberal elite” who sought to control the speech and thoughts of regular folk. Opposition to political correctness also became a way to rebrand racism in ways that were politically acceptable in the    era. Soon, Republican politicians were echoing on the national stage the message that had been   in the academy. In May 1991, President George HW Bush gave a commencement speech at the University of Michigan. In it, he identified political correctness as a major danger to America. “Ironically, on the 200th anniversary of our Bill of Rights, we find free speech under assault throughout the United States,” Bush said. “The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land,” but, he warned, “In their own Orwellian way, crusades that demand correct behaviour crush diversity in the name of diversity. ” After 2001, debates about political correctness faded from public view, replaced by arguments about Islam and terrorism. But in the final years of the Obama presidency, political correctness made a comeback. Or rather,    did. As Black Lives Matter and movements against sexual violence gained strength, a spate of thinkpieces attacked the participants in these movements, criticising and trivialising them by saying that they were obsessed with policing speech. Once again, the conversation initially focused on universities, but the buzzwords were new. Rather than “difference” and “multiculturalism” Americans in 2012 and 2013 started hearing about “trigger warnings” “safe spaces” “microaggressions” “privilege” and “cultural appropriation”. This time, students received more scorn than professors. If the first round of    evoked the spectres of totalitarian regimes, the more recent revival has appealed to the commonplace that millennials are spoiled narcissists, who want to prevent anyone expressing opinions that they happen to find offensive. In January 2015, the writer Jonathan Chait published one of the first new,     thinkpieces in New York magazine. “Not a Very PC Thing to Say” followed the blueprint provided by the   thinkpieces that the New York Times, Newsweek, and indeed New York magazine had published in the early 1990s. Like the New York article from 1991, it began with an anecdote set on campus that supposedly demonstrated that political correctness had run amok, and then extrapolated from this incident to a broad generalisation. In 1991, John Taylor wrote: “The new fundamentalism has concocted a rationale for dismissing all dissent. ” In 2015, Jonathan Chait claimed that there were once again “angry mobs out to crush opposing ideas”. Chait warned that the dangers of PC had become greater than ever before. Political correctness was no longer confined to universities  —   now, he argued, it had taken over social media and thus “attained an influence over mainstream journalism and commentary beyond that of the old”. (As evidence of the “hegemonic” influence enjoyed by unnamed actors on the left, Chait cited two female journalists saying that they had been criticised by leftists on Twitter.) Chait’s article launched a spate of replies about campus and social media “cry bullies”. On the cover of their September 2015 issue, the Atlantic published an article by Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff. The title, “The Coddling Of the American Mind” nodded to the godfather of   Allan Bloom. (Lukianoff is the head of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, another organisation funded by the Olin and Scaife families.) “In the name of emotional wellbeing, college students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don’t like,” the article announced. It was shared over 500, 000 times. These pieces committed many of the same fallacies that their predecessors from the 1990s had. They   anecdotes and caricatured the subjects of their criticism. They complained that other people were creating and enforcing speech codes, while at the same time attempting to enforce their own speech codes. Their writers designated themselves the arbiters of what conversations or political demands deserved to be taken seriously, and which did not. They contradicted themselves in the same way: their authors continually complained, in highly visible publications, that they were being silenced. The climate of digital journalism and social media sharing enabled the    (and    correctness) stories to spread even further and faster than they had in the 1990s.   and    stories come cheap: because they concern identity, they are something that any writer can have a take on, based on his or her experiences, whether or not he or she has the time or resources to report. They are also perfect clickbait. They inspire outrage, or outrage at the outrage of others. Meanwhile, a strange convergence was taking place. While Chait and his fellow liberals decried political correctness, Donald Trump and his followers were doing the same thing. Chait said that leftists were “perverting liberalism” and appointed himself the defender of a liberal centre Trump said that liberal media had the system “rigged”. The   liberals were so focused on leftists on Twitter that for months they gravely underestimated the seriousness of the real threat to liberal discourse. It was not coming from women, people of colour, or queer people organising for their civil rights, on campus or elsewhere. It was coming from @realdonaldtrump,   and   websites such as Breitbart. The original critics of PC were academics or   Ivy League graduates who went around in bow ties quoting Plato and Matthew Arnold. It is hard to imagine Trump quoting Plato or Matthew Arnold, much less carping about the titles of conference papers by literature academics. During his campaign, the network of donors who funded decades of   activity  —   the Kochs, the Olins, the Scaifes  —   shunned Trump, citing concerns about the populist promises he was making. Trump came from a different milieu: not Yale or the University of Chicago, but reality television. And he was picking different fights, targeting the media and political establishment, rather than academia. As a candidate, Trump inaugurated a new phase of   . What was remarkable was just how many different ways Trump deployed this tactic to his advantage, both exploiting the    methods of the early 1990s and adding his own innovations. First, by talking incessantly about political correctness, Trump established the myth that he had dishonest and powerful enemies who wanted to prevent him from taking on the difficult challenges facing the nation. By claiming that he was being silenced, he created a drama in which he could play the hero. The notion that Trump was both persecuted and heroic was crucial to his emotional appeal. It allowed people who were struggling economically or angry about the way society was changing to see themselves in him, battling against a rigged system that made them feel powerless and devalued. At the same time, Trump’s swagger promised that they were strong and entitled to glory. They were great and would be great again. Second, Trump did not simply criticise the idea of political correctness  —   he actually said and did the kind of outrageous things that PC culture supposedly prohibited. The first wave of conservative critics of political correctness claimed they were defending the status quo, but Trump’s mission was to destroy it. In 1991, when George HW Bush warned that political correctness was a threat to free speech, he did not choose to exercise his free speech rights by publicly mocking a man with a disability or characterising Mexican immigrants as rapists. Trump did. Having elevated the powers of PC to mythic status, the   billionaire, son of a slumlord, taunted the parents of a fallen soldier and claimed that his cruelty and malice was, in fact, courage. This willingness to be more outrageous than any previous candidate ensured   media coverage, which in turn helped Trump attract supporters who agreed with what he was saying. We should not underestimate how many Trump supporters held views that were sexist, racist, xenophobic and Islamophobic, and were thrilled to feel that he had given them permission to say so. It’s an old trick: the powerful encourage the less powerful to vent their rage against those who might have been their allies, and to delude themselves into thinking that they have been liberated. It costs the powerful nothing it pays frightful dividends. Trump drew upon a classic element of    by implying that while his opponents were operating according to a political agenda, he simply wanted to do what was sensible. He made numerous controversial policy proposals: deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, banning Muslims from entering the US, introducing    policies that have been ruled unconstitutional. But by responding to critics with the accusation that they were simply being politically correct, Trump attempted to place these proposals beyond the realm of politics altogether. Something political is something that reasonable people might disagree about. By using the adjective as a   Trump pretended that he was acting on truths so obvious that they lay beyond dispute. “That’s just common sense. ” The most alarming part of this approach is what it implies about Trump’s attitude to politics more broadly. His contempt for political correctness looks a lot like contempt for politics itself. He does not talk about diplomacy he talks about “deals”. Debate and disagreement are central to politics, yet Trump has made clear that he has no time for these distractions. To play the    card in response to a legitimate question about policy is to shut down discussion in much the same way that opponents of political correctness have long accused liberals and leftists of doing. It is a way of sidestepping debate by declaring that the topic is so trivial or so contrary to common sense that it is pointless to discuss it. The impulse is authoritarian. And by presenting himself as the champion of common sense, Trump gives himself permission to bypass politics altogether. Now that he is   it is unclear whether Trump meant many of the things he said during his campaign. But, so far, he is fulfilling his pledge to fight political correctness. Last week, he told the New York Times that he was trying to build an administration filled with the “best people” though “Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people, because that hasn’t been working. ” Trump has also continued to cry PC in response to criticism. When an interviewer from Politico asked a Trump transition team member why Trump was appointing so many lobbyists and political insiders, despite having pledged to “drain the swamp” of them, the source said that “one of the most refreshing parts of   …     the whole Trump style is that he does not care about political correctness. ” Apparently it would have been politically correct to hold him to his campaign promises. As Trump prepares to enter the White House, many pundits have concluded that “political correctness” fuelled the populist backlash sweeping Europe and the US. The leaders of that backlash may say so. But the truth is the opposite: those leaders understood the power that    has to rally a class of voters, largely white, who are disaffected with the status quo and resentful of shifting cultural and social norms. They were not reacting to the tyranny of political correctness, nor were they returning America to a previous phase of its history. They were not taking anything back. They were wielding    as a weapon, using it to forge a new political landscape and a frightening future. The opponents of political correctness always said they were crusaders against authoritarianism. In fact,   has paved the way for the populist authoritarianism now spreading everywhere. Trump is   correctness gone mad. Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."
"The Republican party, its leaders like to say, is a party of ideas. Debates over budgets and government programmes are important, but they must be conducted with an eye on the bigger questions  —   questions about the character of the state, the future of freedom and the meaning of virtue. These beliefs provide the foundation for a conservative intellectual establishment  —   thinktanks such as the American Enterprise Institute, magazines such as National Review, pundits such as George Will and Bill Kristol  —   dedicated to advancing the right’s agenda. Over the last year, that establishment has been united by one thing: opposition to Donald Trump. Republican voters may have succumbed to a temporary bout of collective insanity  —   or so Trump’s critics on the right believe  —   but the party’s intelligentsia remain certain that entrusting the Republican nomination to a reality television star turned populist demagogue has been a disaster for their cause and their country. Whatever Trump might be, he is not a conservative. That belief is comforting, but it is wrong. Trump is a unique character, but the principles he defends and the passions he inflames have been part of the modern American right since its formation in the aftermath of the second world war. Most conservative thinkers have forgotten or repressed this part of their history, which is why they are undergoing a collective nervous breakdown today. Like addicts the morning after a bender, they are baffled at the face they see in the mirror. But not all of the right’s intellectuals have been so blind. While keepers of the conservative flame in Washington and New York repeatedly proclaimed that Trump could never win the Republican nomination, in February a small group of anonymous writers from inside the conservative movement launched a blog that championed “Trumpism”  —   and attacked their former allies on the right, who were determined to halt its ascent. In recognition of the man who inspired it, they called their site the Journal of American Greatness. Writing under pseudonyms borrowed from antiquity, such as “Decius” the masked authors described the site, called JAG by its fans, as the “first scholarly journal of radical #Trumpism”. Posts analysing the campaign with titles such as The Twilight of Jeb! alternated with more ambitious forays in philosophy such as   Part I: Metaphysics and Epistemology. More intellectually demanding than the typical National Review article, the style of their prose also suggested writers who were having fun. Disquisitions on Aristotle could be followed by an emoji mocking the latest outraged responses to Trump. The authors at JAG were not all backing Trump himself  —   officially, they were “electorally agnostic”  —   but they were united by their enthusiasm for Trumpism (as they put it, “for what Trumpism could become if thought through with wisdom and moderation”). They dismissed commentators who attributed Trump’s victory to his celebrity, arguing that a campaign could not resonate with so many voters unless it spoke to genuine public concerns. JAG condensed Trumpism into three key elements: economic nationalism, controlled borders and a foreign policy that put American interests first. These policies, they asserted, were a direct challenge to the views of America’s new ruling class  —   a cosmopolitan elite of wealthy professionals who controlled the commanding heights of public discourse. This new ruling class of “transnational  ” was united by its belief that the welfare of the world just happened to coincide with programmes that catered to its own  : free trade, open borders, globalisation and a suite of other policies designed to ease the transition to a   future overseen by enlightened experts. In the language of JAG, they are the “Davoisie” a global elite that is most at ease among its international peers at the World Economic Forum in Davos and totally out of touch with ordinary Americans. Mainstream conservatives and their liberal counterparts were equally complicit in sustaining this regime, but JAG focused its attention on the right. Leading Republican politicians and the journalists who fawned over them in the rightwing press were pedlars of an “intellectually bankrupt” doctrine whose obsessions  —   cutting taxes, policing sexual norms, slashing government regulation  —   distracted from “the fundamental question” Trump had put on the agenda: “destruction of the soulless managerial class”. JAG unleashed salvo after salvo against “Conservatism Inc” the network of journals and thinktanks that, along with talk radio and Fox News, has made defending the party of ideas into a lucrative career path. “If Trump ends up destroying the Republican party,” they wrote, “it is because the Republican party, as it exists today, is little more than a jobs programme for failed academics and journalists. ” News of JAG began circulating on the right shortly after its debut early in the primary season. “The first time I heard someone refer to it, I thought it was a joke,” says former George W Bush speechwriter David Frum. But it quickly found an audience. “They got a huge response almost immediately,” says conservative activist Chris Buskirk, who recalled excited emails and frantic texting among his colleagues. In June, the Wall Street Journal columnist and former Ronald Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan alerted her readers to the “sophisticated, rather brilliant and anonymous website”. A link from the popular rightwing website Breitbart News drove traffic even higher, and JAG seemed poised to shape the discussion over the future of conservatism. Then it disappeared. Months of posts, totalling more than 175, 000 words, were scrubbed from the internet, replaced by a note labelling the site an “inside joke” that had spiralled out of control. Within the right, rumours swirled about the real motives behind the vanishing act fans of JAG took its   as further evidence that the conservative establishment would not tolerate any dissent. But the brief life of the Journal of American Greatness did more than provide grist for feverish speculation on Twitter. Patrolling the boundaries of acceptable thought on the right has always been one of the central duties of the conservative intellectual, and JAG’s voluntary purging was the latest chapter in a long battle to define the meaning of conservatism. Conservatives tend to portray their cause as the child of a revolt against the liberal status quo that began in the aftermath of the second world war, gained momentum in the 1950s when a cohort of intellectuals supplied the right with its philosophical underpinning, attained political consciousness in Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign, and won vindication with Ronald Reagan’s election to the White House. Ideas have consequences, they proclaimed. Just look at us. But there is another way of interpreting the history of the American right, one that puts less emphasis on the power of ideas and more on power itself  —   a history of white voters fighting to defend their place in the social hierarchy, politicians appealing to the prejudices of their constituents so they can satisfy the wishes of their donors, and the industry that has turned conservatism into a   business. This is the explanation preferred by leftwing critics, who typically regard the Republican party as a coalition fuelled by white nationalism and funded by billionaires. But this line of attack also has a long history on the right, where a dissenting minority has been waging a guerrilla war against the conservative establishment for three decades. Now the unlikely figure of Donald Trump has brought in a wave of reinforcements  —   over 13 million in the primaries alone. Their target is the managerial elite, and their history begins in the   to the second world war, when a forgotten founder of modern American conservatism became a public sensation with a book that announced the dawning of a civilisation ruled by experts. The Managerial Revolution: What Is Happening in the World was the most unlikely bestseller of 1941. The author, James Burnham, was a philosophy professor at New York University who until the previous year had been one of Leon Trotsky’s most trusted counsellors in the US. Time called Burnham’s work a grim outline of “the totalitarian world soon to come” that was “as morbidly fascinating as a textbook vivisection”. The son of a wealthy railway executive, Burnham graduated near the top of his class in Princeton in 1927 before studying at Oxford and then securing his post at NYU. But the Great Depression radicalised him, and he began a double life, lecturing on Aquinas by day and polemicising against capital by night. By 1940, Burnham had lost his faith in the revolution of the proletariat. While Trotsky denounced his erstwhile disciple as an “educated witch doctor” Burnham started work on the book that would justify his apostasy. According to Burnham, Marxists were right to anticipate capitalism’s imminent demise but wrong about what would come next. Around the turn of the 20th century, he claimed, the scale of life had changed. Population growth surged, immense corporations gobbled up smaller rivals, and government officials struggled to expand their powers to match the growing size of the challenges they faced. These structural changes fundamentally altered the distribution of power in society. In the 18th century, authority had rested with aristocrats in the 19th century with capitalists in the 20th century it had passed on to the managers, whose authority derived from their unique ability to operate the complex institutions that now dominated mass society. Technocrats had become the new ruling class. According to Burnham, fascism, Stalinism and Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal were all products of this transformation, and there was no use struggling against the world that was coming into being  —   a world where state ownership of the means of production had become the norm, where sovereignty had shifted to a bureaucratic elite, and where the globe was divided into rival superstates. Burnham was not the first to foresee a society run by managers, but the arguments he borrowed from others took on a different meaning when brought together in this form. His sweep was global, his narrative reached back centuries, and he almost seemed to welcome a totalitarian future. For Burnham, the only sensible response to the managerial revolution was to recognise that it had occurred and accept there was no point in trying to bring back a world that was already lost. This bleak forecast captured the public imagination. Fortune called it “the most debated book published so far this year” and it went on to sell more than 200, 000 copies. But Burnham quickly moved on to new territory. His true subject, he concluded, was power, and to understand power he needed a theory of politics. Marx had been his guiding influence in The Managerial Revolution now he turned to Machiavelli, constructing the genealogy of a political theory that began with the author of The Prince and continued into the present. For a Machiavellian, Burnham wrote, politics was an unending war for dominance: democracy was a myth, and all ideologies were thinly veiled rationalisations for  . The great mass of humanity, in Burnham’s dark vision, would never have any control over their own lives. They could only hope that clashes between rival elites might weaken the power of the ruling class and open up small spaces of freedom. Burnham’s newfound zeal for defending freedom led him, in 1955, to a conservative magazine called National Review, and to the magazine’s charismatic young founder, William F Buckley Jr. Buckley’s goal was to turn a scattered collection of reactionaries into the seeds of a movement. His journal set out to make the right intellectually respectable, stripping it of the associations with kooks and cranks that allowed liberals to depict it as a politics for   who had not reconciled themselves to modernity. Burnham was there at the start, one of five senior editors on the masthead of the first issue. Soon Burnham was Buckley’s ranking deputy. But in an editorial staff riven by abstract debates between ardent libertarians and devout Christians, Burnham was the pragmatist who urged his colleagues not to ask politicians for more than the electorate would accept. For the right to win over   voters, Burnham argued, the movement had to embrace a more populist economic policy  —   contrary to the wishes of his   colleagues and their corporate backers, who wanted to lower taxes on the rich and roll back the welfare state. “Much of conservative doctrine,” Burnham wrote in 1972, “is, if not quite bankrupt, more and more obviously obsolescent. ” Less than a decade later, Ronald Reagan was president, and it was Burnham who seemed like a relic of the past. For a long time, the only major study of Burnham’s work was a slim volume published in 1984 by a minor academic press under the title Power and History. The book’s author, Samuel Francis, seemed a typical product of the insurgent conservative movement Burnham had helped to create  —   though by the late 1990s, when Francis published an updated version of Power and History, it made more sense to speak of a new conservative establishment. Outsiders who arrived at the White House with Reagan had become senior executives in Conservatism Inc. With the end of the cold war, the right had lost the glue that had bound its coalition, but there were still battles to be waged, and the money was better than ever. Francis was never going to become a star in the emerging rightwing infotainment complex. Shy and overweight, with teeth stained from smoking, he had difficulty making it through cocktail parties. After completing a PhD in British history at the University of North Carolina, Francis left academia for Washington  —   first working at a rightwing thinktank, then serving as an aide to a Republican senator, and finally joining the editorial staff of the capital’s influential conservative daily newspaper, the Washington Times. Francis retained his academic interests while he ascended into the ranks of the conservative establishment. He published six books in his lifetime, but he worked in private on one massive volume that he hoped would bring together all the disparate strands of his thought. Finished in 1995 but not discovered until after his death a decade later, the result was published earlier this year under the title Leviathan and Its Enemies. It is a sprawling text, more than 700 pages long, digressive, repetitive and in desperate need of an editor. It is also one of the most impressive books to come out of the American right in a generation  —   and the most frightening. It is a searching diagnosis of managerial society, written by an author looking for a strategy that could break it apart. Like much of Francis’s writing, Leviathan and Its Enemies began with Burnham  —   in this case, quite literally. “This book,” Francis announced in the first sentence, “is an effort to revise and reformulate the theory of the managerial revolution as advanced by James Burnham in 1941. ” Francis agreed that society had been taken over by managers, but he believed the new ruling class was far more vulnerable than Burnham had realised. Not everyone had benefited from the rise of the experts  —   and Francis saw this unequal distribution of rewards as the managerial regime’s greatest weakness. For reasons he never quite explained, he insisted that the cosmopolitan elite threatened the traditional values cherished by most Americans: “morality and religion, family, nation, local community, and at times racial integrity and identity”. These were sacred principles for members of a new “  proletariat” drawn from the working class and the lower ranks of the middle class. Lacking the skills prized by technocrats, but not far enough down the social ladder to win the attention of reformers, these white voters considered themselves victims of a coalition between the top and bottom against the middle. According to Francis, this cohort had supplied the animating spirit of rightwing politics since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. They had supported Goldwater  —   but Francis regarded Goldwater’s programme, like the “movement conservatism” of the National Review, as a “quaintly bourgeois” throwback to the oligarchic politics of the 19th century, with nothing to offer the modern working man. Their tribune was not Goldwater but George Wallace, the notorious segregationist and Democratic governor of Alabama  —   who won five southern states as an   rights   candidate in the 1968 presidential election. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan had appealed to this group, too, but neglected their interests after taking office. Despite having elected multiple presidents, the   proletariat had yet to find a voice. Yet Francis had difficulty explaining why managerial society would generate so much opposition in the first place. In Leviathan and Its Enemies, he argued that resistance to the cosmopolitan elite would be driven by “immutable elements of human nature” that “necessitate attachment to the concrete and historical roots of moral values and meaning”. He was more candid in a speech he gave while working on the book. “What we as whites must do,” he declared, “is reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites. ” Where mainstream conservatives depicted the US as a nation whose diverse population was linked by devotion to its founding principles, Francis viewed it as a racial project inextricably bound up with white rule. The managerial revolution jeopardised this racial hierarchy, and so it must be overthrown. Francis delivered his remarks on racial consciousness at a conference organised by American Renaissance, an obscure journal devoted to promoting white nationalism. Years earlier, Francis had struck up a friendship with Jared Taylor, who went on to found the magazine with Francis’s encouragement. From their first encounter, Taylor recalled, he and Francis “understood each other immediately”. Francis’s employers at the Washington Times were not as sympathetic. The paper fired him after his comments were released, a move that was part of his larger expulsion from the respectable right. Buckley himself dismissed Francis as “spokesman” for a group that had “earned their exclusion from thoughtful conservative ranks”. Yet Francis would not be so easily purged. For years he had cultivated a relationship with Pat Buchanan, a   Nixon protege who had become one of the country’s most recognisable conservatives thanks to his role as   of CNN’s popular debating programme Crossfire. In 1992, Buchanan launched a   campaign against incumbent president George HW Bush that, against all expectations, garnered almost 3m votes in the primaries. While all this was going on, Buchanan was growing closer to Francis, whom he later called “perhaps the brightest and best thinker on the right”. Francis and Buchanan were linked by their association with a breakaway faction on the right known as paleoconservatism. While mainstream conservatives had taken advantage of cushy gigs in New York and Washington, paleocons depicted themselves as spokesmen for the forgotten residents of flyover country. Francis urged Buchanan to make another run for the White House in 1996, this time as the candidate of the   resistance. That campaign would be based on three issues: protectionism, opposition to immigration and an “America First” foreign policy that repudiated global commitments and foreign interventions in order to focus on defending the national interest. Buchanan listened, and he went on to a surprise win in New Hampshire’s pivotal early primary, convincing Francis that the managerial elite was more vulnerable than at any point in his lifetime. While mainstream Republicans and Democrats celebrated forecasts that the US population was on track to become less than 50% white as a sign of America’s capacity to adapt and grow, Francis believed that the members of his   proletariat regarded these shifting demographics as another reminder of their dwindling power. Buchanan’s campaign fizzled after New Hampshire, but Francis had a ready explanation for the collapse: Buchanan was too loyal to the Republican party to seize the opportunity he had been granted. “Don’t even use the word ‘conservative,’” Francis told Buchanan. “It doesn’t mean anything any more. ” The managerial class had absorbed Buckley and his followers. They, too, were the enemy. After Buchanan’s defeat and his own exile from mainstream conservatism, Francis devoted himself to what he called “racialpolitik”. He was a regular contributor to outlets promoting white racial consciousness  —   becoming, in Jared Taylor’s words, “the intellectual leader of a small but growing movement”. Francis denied that he was a white supremacist, but he condemned interracial sex, warned of “incipient race war” and drafted a manifesto for a white nationalist group arguing: “The American people and government should remain European in their composition and character. ” When he looked ahead, Francis was especially concerned with the threat that one rising political star posed to his vision of the future. Barack Obama, he remarked in 2004, was “the model of what the New American is supposed to be”. Ivy   effortlessly cosmopolitan, promising to transcend barriers of race  —   Obama was the embodiment of the managerial elite. He represented everything Francis loathed about the contemporary United States. The fact that Obama, Francis’s symbol for American decadence, became one of the most popular figures in the country brought the great contradiction of his thought into relief. The 19th century belonged to the bourgeoisie and the 20th century to the managers, he argued, because these rising classes had performed necessary social functions. His   proletariat, by contrast, were on the decline. So was Francis. The supposed realist who cast hunger for power as the driving force of world history spent most of his time writing for journals with subscribers in the low five figures. In his last years, he was a lonely man. Before his sudden death from a cardiac aneurism in 2005, he had begun a study of conservatism and race. His masterpiece, Leviathan and Its Enemies, was still tucked away in a box of floppy disks when it was published 11 years later, it would be under the auspices of a   press. The   Washington Examiner ran one of his few obituaries. “Sam Francis,” it said, “was merely a racist and doesn’t deserve to be remembered as anything less. ” It seemed just as likely that Francis would not be remembered at all. “I want you to really listen to this,” Rush Limbaugh told his listeners in January this year. The king of rightwing talk radio was lecturing his audience, which averages around 13 million people a week, on Samuel Francis. Prompted by a magazine article casting Francis as the prophet of Trumpism, Limbaugh read aloud from one of Francis’s   on the Buchanan campaign. “What’s interesting,” Limbaugh said, “is how right on it is in foretelling Trump. ” Before abandoning the subject, he added one point. Francis, Limbaugh noted, “later in life suffered the  —   acquired the  —   reputation of being a white supremacist” a reputation Limbaugh insisted was undeserved. The white nationalists who rallied to Francis in the last decade of his life disagree on that point, but they also see Trump as a vindication of their longtime inspiration. “Sam would have said that Trump is doing exactly what he advised Patrick Buchanan to do,” maintains Jared Taylor, who made news in the primary season when it was revealed that he had recorded automated phone messages endorsing Trump. (“White Supremacist Robocall Heartily Urges Iowa Voters to Support Trump,” reported a headline in the conservative Daily Caller.) According to Taylor’s American Renaissance, “Francis would be very pleased to see the GOP and conservative establishments mocked and destroyed. ” Even liberal commentators are looking back at Francis  —   whose prediction of a white   backlash against a globalist ruling elite seems to be coming true not just in the US but across Europe. “If you just drop the white nationalism a lot of Francis makes sense,” says Michael Lind, who once worked as an assistant to Buckley but now describes himself as a “radical centrist”. According to Lind, conservatives have been “spurning their natural constituency  —   the mostly white working class” creating space for the rise of Trump. Francis was also an inspiration for the team at the Journal of American Greatness, who called him “the closest thing to what could be described as the source of Trumpian thought” in their very first post. They admitted that Francis’s writing “overtly indulges various Southern nostalgias” but insisted that his “deservedly criticised statements on race” could be separated from the core of his analysis. The managerial class was still the enemy, and only Trump seemed even dimly aware of what it would take to mount an effective challenge. But the authors at JAG wanted to do more than add chapters to the history Francis had already sketched. While they remain anonymous, sources have identified them as part of a conservative establishment located outside the   York axis that dominates the intellectual life of the American right  —   probably associated with the   Claremont Institute and the midwestern Hillsdale College. Trump the candidate, they admitted, was at best an imperfect messenger. But it was the message that counted: “The American regime  —   like nearly all its cousins in the west  —   has devolved into an oligarchy. ” JAG was not just arguing that Trump’s campaign had a coherent agenda  —   a controversial assertion, given that many on both the left and right have dismissed Trump as an unhinged demagogue jabbing randomly at pressure points in the electorate. It was arguing that Trump succeeded because of his platform. Without those ideas, he would have been just another novelty candidate. Armed with them, any of Trump’s more disciplined rivals might have stolen the nomination from him  —   but instead they opted for recycled bromides from the Reagan era. The site could be fiery in its defence of Trump, but the best moments came when its targets were the grandees of the right. There are plenty of scathing articles about rightwing thinktanks written from the left, but none of their authors could write a sentence such as “Seeing conservatives court billionaires  —   which I have had occasion to do dozens, if not hundreds, of times  —   is like watching dorks tell cheerleaders how pretty they are. ” For all that, the authors of JAG were still thinkers who looked at the problems facing the US and concluded that Donald Trump might be the answer. They denounced conservatives for accepting “the leftist lie” that having a “natural affinity for people who look, think and speak” alike “is shameful and illegitimate”. “The ceaseless importation of people unaccustomed to liberty,” they wrote  —   referring to “mass third world immigration”  —   “makes the American people less fit for liberty every day”. Islam was a subject of particular concern. “What good,” they asked, “has Muslim immigration done for the United States and the American people?” Francis would have approved. With its archive deleted, JAG’s internet presence is now confined to the occasional mournful tweet from one of its former readers, but the problems it identified on the right are more glaring than ever. “The conservative movement’s mission has become providing comfortable professional livelihoods to literally hundreds of people,” David Frum told me recently. Although this behemoth has proved effective at turning a profit, the intellectual returns on the investment have been paltry. “Conservatism was a lot more creative and effective when it had less money,” Frum said. This narrowing of intellectual ambitions has coincided with a crisis of authority. When asked to name the dominant theme of the right’s intellectual history since George W Bush left office, conservative journalist Michael Brendan Dougherty responded with one word: “disintegration”. Buckley has been dead for the better part of a decade, and no successor has emerged with the clout to take up his role as arbiter of the true faith. Meanwhile, the little magazines that once set the tempo of debate have struggled to maintain their influence in the age of social media. “Twenty years ago if you got the summer internship at National Review you were   everyone you knew,” one conservative activist told me. “That was like getting the Goldman Sachs internship. You were set. ” Charles Kesler, a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute and professor at nearby Claremont McKenna College, sees a generational change underway. His best students, he says, used to seek out three paths: some went into academia, others into politics, and a third group tried to navigate a path between the two as writers for middlebrow journals such as National Review. But that middle ground has eroded in the last decade, Kesler says. Now many feel “revulsion” at the state of public debate and take refuge in academia  —   or they succumb to a “populist tug” and end up at rightwing clickbait factories such as Breitbart News. That pull will only grow stronger now that Trump has shown how little influence establishment conservatives have over the constituency they claim to represent. In Washington, a   cohort dubbed the reformicons has become the great hope for conservatives planning their response to the rise of Trump. Long before this year’s campaign, they had begun to devise a more populist agenda to appeal to the   voters who have become an increasingly significant part of the Republican electorate. With an eye to the future, they are also convinced that Republicans need to reject Trump’s brand of white identity politics if it hopes to win elections in a country becoming more diverse by the day. From the reformicon perspective, Trump represents a pathological response to the legitimate complaints of voters whose concerns have been overlooked for too long. The challenge for savvy Republican politicians is to convert the impulses that have propelled Trump’s rise into a platform that can appeal to a multiracial coalition. Yet the   reforming wonks have struggled to find an audience outside the capital. Part of the problem is financial. “There’s no money from rich donors even for reasonable populism,” says Michael Lind. To the ears of conservative billionaires, pleas for economic policies that appeal to workers sound like the prelude to tax hikes on the wealthy. For a   movement offering what the sceptics at JAG called “managerialism with a human face” a lack of wealthy donors is a potentially fatal obstacle. Of all the forces unleashed by the rise of Trump, the one that may pose the greatest threat to the relevance of the conservative intellectual establishment is the gleefully offensive movement known as the  . Nurtured by online forums such as Reddit and 4chan, along with   standbys such as American Renaissance, the   has become a vehicle for the simmering anger of mostly white and mostly young men  —   with strong links to the earlier varieties of racialpolitik promoted by Francis, who is sometimes cited as a founder of the  . Mainstream conservatives have reacted with shock and horror to this development. “The nasty   Buckley expelled from conservatism have returned,” declared a typical response from Commentary, one of the major journals of the establishment right. But the new iconoclasts of the   can’t be purged from a conservative movement they have no desire to join, especially when they can reach an audience of millions on social media. If there is an heir today to the young William F Buckley  —   who launched his career with exuberant attacks on the hypocrisy of the liberal establishment and managed to make conservatism look like a stylish rebellion against the     —   it might be someone like Milo Yiannopoulos, a professional provocateur who has become a spokesman for the  . At one typical event this spring, Yiannopoulos, who refers to Trump as “Daddy” delivered a lecture with the title Feminism Is Cancer after being ushered into the auditorium on a throne held aloft by students wearing “Make America Great Again” hats. Yiannopoulos’s critics are rightly concerned that his main agenda is promoting himself, but Brand Milo is a booming business. The future looks more precarious for the guardians of True Conservatism. They have strong support from leading figures in the Republican party such as Paul Ryan, and retain control over an infrastructure of donors, thinktanks and journals. A landslide defeat for Trump could still revive their cause, but they could just as easily be swept aside by a rising generation of rightwing activists with a more Trumpian set of concerns. Their brand of conservatism won’t disappear, but it could become more a curiosity than a movement, as it was in the days before the birth of the modern right over half a century ago. “The whole Buckley experiment may have been a passing phase,” says Lind  —   a strange interlude when a cohort of writers mistook their ideological preferences for the will of the people and, even stranger, provided the basis for an industry based on that delusion. The anxiety that its time has passed lurks underneath all the conservative establishment’s impassioned denunciations of Trump: a fear that his unprecedented victory in the Republican primary has demonstrated it is already obsolete. “I’m a conservative,” Trump said in April, “but at this point who cares?” But Trump may have unintentionally pointed the way for a new kind of American conservatism, driven by resentment at the globalist diktats of the hated managerial class. Over the last year, that anger has emerged in surprising venues. In language that Francis would have recognised, the billionaire PayPal   and Silicon Valley guru Peter Thiel declared that America is no longer a democracy  —   since it has become a country “dominated by very unelected, technocratic agencies”. Thiel has been an outspoken libertarian since his days as an undergraduate at Stanford in the 1980s, and in 2008 he supplied $500, 000 for an attempt to create manmade islands that would provide an “escape from politics in all its forms” but lately he has started to associate himself with a different crowd. In July, following an outpouring of criticism, he cancelled a planned appearance in front of a group that has provided a meeting ground for libertarians and white nationalists, including Francis’s close friend Jared Taylor. But a similar public outcry did not persuade him to drop another speaking engagement earlier that month: a speech on the final night of the Republican national convention, where he had come as a delegate to cast his vote for Donald Trump. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."
"The Flydubai air safety reports leaked to the Guardian cover all manner of incidents and mishaps as recorded by pilots during March and April this year. This is a selection of their reports, which have been abridged in some cases. The sentences in bold have been highlighted by the Guardian.  The misspellings are as they appear in the documents English is the language used by pilots, but it is not necessarily a pilot’s mother tongue.  In all, the reports include 42 complaints about or experience of fatigue 25 bird strikes 10 medical emergencies five laser incidents one bomb threat one “dogs on the runway” and one unstable aircraft due to unstable truffles. The Guardian put the concerns raised by the pilots to Flydubai. The airline said it had developed a “blame free” working culture to allow pilots to raise anxieties. “Concerns around rostering and fatigue have been raised as part of the open safety reporting mechanism and however small the proportion we take them all equally seriously,” a spokesman said. “The system is designed to encourage pilots to report all safety concerns as soon as possible. “Flydubai has never and would never ask its crew to operate outside legally permitted hours. All flights are planned within legal limits. “We have developed a comprehensive operational system with safety at its core. Our policies, procedures and control systems are applied to every operational function of our airline. They exist to provide our crews with a safe, regulated framework to help them meet the demands of their roles. ” NCC Network crew control, FMS Flight management system, SCCM Senior cabin crew member,   Operations manual A, ATC Air traffic control, RWY Runway, SOP Standard operating procedure, SO Second officer, FDP Flight duty period, ASR Air safety report, Less than an hour before reaching our destination in Kiev, the senior came to the cockpit and informed us of a passenger who had told a cabin crew member that he had a bomb on board. The senior told that the situation had occurred when the cabin crew had refused to serve the passenger any more alcohol because he was getting too intoxicated and was becoming aggressive. It became quite apparent that he most likely did not have a bomb, but we of course did not want to take any chances (he was Russian, we were just entering Ukraine, he was very verbal about being a Putin supporter  —   do the maths!) so we called NCC straight away. The crew started bomb search checklist according to   with no findings. We decided to keep low profile with the situation on board to avoid any panic.  Upon landing in Kiev, the ATC told us to park on the taxi way, and at this point i informed passengers to remain seated since we had not reached our parking position. We did know what the local authorities plan was at this stage, but i was communicating directly with airport police from the cockpit window. We were probably waiting for 30 minutes on the taxi way with very little information.  The only thing they told me was that we were not allowed to disembark until ‘special forces’ arrived on scene. It is fair to say that the whole situation seemed very unprofessional and disorganized on their part, since we were waiting for such a long time, and as i told them  —   if we DID indeed have a bomb on our aircraft, i wanted to get my passengers off asap.  They were informed by NCC at least 30 minutes before we even landed in Kiev, and yet, we were waiting for so long. The passengers were of course becoming impatient and agitated, since they did not know what was going on, so i decided to make an announcement where i told them there was a ‘security incident’ and that we were awaiting airport officials. I did not want to lie, but i also wanted to avoid using the word ‘bomb’.  Finally, after approximately 200 security and military personel had surrounded the aircraft in a very dramatic manor, the were ready to come on board. They wanted to evacuate the passengers, but at this point i had to refuse, since the whole situation was a getting a bit ridiculous. As i told them, we had been sitting on the taxi way for over 30 minutes  —   if there had been a bomb on board, it would most probably have been detonated already!!  I did not want to cause panic and possible injury to my passengers, so i insisted on a normal disembarkation after the man was removed by police. After all passengers had left the aircraft, we did a thorough bomb search with the bomb squad (technical compartments etc were checked by FO).  No findings, but quite a delay.  Senior sleeping during flight in a business class!  During cruise stage, before I came out of the flight deck for physical need, it was brought to my attention by crew member that the Senior was sleeping in the business class seat. I immediately requested one of the crew to wake him, later he was again observed through security camera sleeping on the jump seat. After landing, the senior was debriefed. The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft’s wings would need   due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers.  During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the   mix of the crew and said ‘why aren’t there more Russian crew on the flight?’ The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn’t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^ .  The flight deck was made aware of the situation by SCM, the captain elected to offload the passengers in light of their inebriated state and verbal abuse of the crew. During the above delay the captain was also talking with NCC as it was becoming apparent the flight deck and most likely cabin crew would be going in to discretion. In light of the length of the initial duty, time of report, crew’s rest, subsequent planned duties and the stress of the onboard situations it was agreed as a crew that we would not be happy to go in to discretion. The captain had numerous conversations with NCC explaining the situation yet NCC kept using unrealistic timings and calculations that were not based on facts from KRR. NCC appeared to have a distrust of the flight decks information and kept asking to speak with the FZ ground staff who reiterated the same information passed on by the flight deck. The ground staff was exceptionally busy dealing with multiple issues and to be continually called and interrupted by NCC was unhelpful and exacerbated the delays. It is unsafe and unhelpful for crewing to continually ask the crew to go in to discretion especially after the crew have said they don’t feel safe to continue in to discretion. Once the crew have made the statement they aren’t safe to go in to discretion it should be taken as set in stone and not something to try and whittle away at! No one wants to cause additional delays, disruption and end up at an out station. If we felt safe to continue to Dubai we would have done so! The flight eventually departed 1hr 43mins late, with the crew agreeing to set off for Dubai but knowing that we would be most likely diverting to Kuwait. It became quickly apparent that our initial assessment was correct and it was agreed we would divert to Kuwait, this was revised to Doha after NCC called on the SATCOM to say there were no seats available from Kuwait for 8 hours. NCC called the aircraft SAT phone approximately 4 times during the flight with the last call being made after being specifically asked not to call anymore as we were very busy and it was an unwanted distraction, they were asked to send an ACARS message to communicate if required.  During the last call NCC asked AGAIN for us to continue on to Dubai despite the crew stating numerous times prior they were diverting as they didn’t feel safe to continue! It is unacceptable to apply pressure, however pleasantly it is done, trying to sweet talk a crew in to doing something they have said they feel is unsafe is unprofessionally and extremely dangerous! We arrived in to Doha at 0812 just over 1 hour in to discretion. The KRR crew were relieved by the stby crew at approximately 0945. The total duty was 16hrs 09mins. Reported fatigued for duty, due to fatigue resulting from assigned roster. Waited on ground with passengers on board from approximately 9am to 5pm due to ground delays and general disorganization from ramp personel. Without adequate food and water we disembarked the passengers. Crew control scheduled me for another flight that was inevitably going to go into discretion. I was tired, hungry and unfit for the extra duty. I went home fatigued. From time to time I have difficulty in sleeping due to my body clock constantly changing due to the amount of switching from day to night flights I have been subjected to over the last 4 years or more. I can produce my rosters if required. I could not sleep before my 301 duty, although I had been up since 0515 that morning, and went to bed at around 6pm ready for my 0320 report. In the interest of safety I deemed it better to not operate in a   condition. This was not a case of tactical sickness, but a genuine case of not being able to sleep, and the safety implications of operating an aircraft in an unsuitable condition. At this stage I do not think I need to visit an AME, but if it continues beyond my annual leave I will consult the relevent departments in flydubai. I was scheduled to fly 4 sectors with xxxxx. Following are my serious concerns about xxxxx’s flying technique, adherence to SOPs and lack of CRM. 1. Bounced Landing: In absolutely calm winds at Muscat, ILS 26 R the aircraft bounced after landing and touched down very firmly the second time, in my opinion it was due to wrong flare technique. 2. He has constant habit of making and then executing FMS route and approach changes without informing other crew member, that includes deletion of planned route points and creating and executing new way points for approach. This is a serious flight safety issue and he must be briefed about the company SOPs on the subject. 3. He has a dangerous tendency to go heads down and make and executes FMS changes being PF, and that too well below 7500 feet in Dubai terminal area with extreme air traffic all around. This all he does even when PM is not doing any other task. When told to refrain from this, he makes gestures of annoyance and then stop announcing FMA changes as a reaction, and does not respond to FMS changes announced by the PM on his behalf. 4. Almost on every before and after take off checklist and landing checklist he announces it through memory and does not even bother to take it out or use the one on control column, which is obvious as he does not turn on the light and his note book covering the checklist on control column. Occasionally he takes out the checklist but makes no effort to read it, he just holds it and announce checks verbally. 5. He makes gestures and raises his voice when told to do something, he does not like to be told anything and shows no respect and courtesy to other crew member. Fatigue report, Shifting to morning flight after 3 days night flights then back again to fly late night flight didn’t allow me to get at least couple of hours of sleep before the flight. In addition, I was coming from a long fight which needed a proper rest. Exceeding maximum hours duty  I was rostered to fly to TIF [Taif, Saudi Arabia] reporting at 0540Z. I shall preface this report with the note that this was an exceptional day, and we were all in some degree of shock from the tragedy we’d all just heard about. I reported on time and we proceeded to the aircraft. Whilst preparing the aircraft for passengers, crew control called me and told me that they needed to change me to a different flight, BTS ( ). I said that I would prefer not to operate such a long day if possible, but since it was such an unusual day, if they really needed me then of course I would help. Crew control said that I was their only option and 100% they needed me, so I agreed. It was about 0640Z by the time I was able to reach the other aircraft, 2 other crew members arrived as well after me and we departed at 0757Z. The rest of the day proceeded as planned, with about 30 mins of holding on the arrival back into Dubai. I was off duty at 2131Z. The scheduled length of duty day, from ‘off blocks’ till ‘off duty’ (since I had already checked in) for that flight is 13:00. The actual time we did it in was 13:34.  I knew that I must be high on hours as I had already had one flight removed after a standby call out in order to maintain my legality in that week, however I assumed that I would not be asked to do anything that would take me over any limits. Looking at ecrew, it says that my total duty time for a 7 day period, from the 13th  —   19th March was 62 hours.   7. 18. 1 says that the max should be 55, or increased up to 60 in case of unforeseen delays. I understand that these were exceptional circumstances, but even given that, it looks like I was asked to undertake the duty knowing that it would take me over the maximum duty limit. We left as quickly as we could, and flew the plane as expected. I raise this, mostly for the safety of our crews. In times like this where we are experiencing extreme disruption, it’s easy to forget about limits, but they are there for a reason. We are often rostered close to the limit anyway, and the crewing department do need to be careful with what they are asking people to do. If my calculations are not correct, then I am willing to be corrected, but I’m just reporting what they system’s telling me.  UNFIT FOR FLIGHT, Following 3 consecutive night duties ending this morning at 02:19 LT I couldn’t rest properly for my next flight FZ63 with reporting time at 16:20 LT. I advised Crew Control and offered to swap my following day off for any flight so that I could get a longer rest period, but there was no option available. Very difficult week after the accident, lot of commotion, ops disruptions, lot of flights in sequence, yesterday from KWI to DWC [Kuwait to Dubai World Central] very bad wx from 6000ft until landing at DWC, followed for a  . Lack of sleep tonight, only 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. I am feeling tired. Flight to krasnodar planned into discretion when taking into account the garaunteed   at destination and the weather in Dubai upon arrival which would inevitably create delays, not to mention planning to arrive at the morning busy period in Dubai. Actual FDP originally 10:30, max FDP 11:15, adjusted FDP by crew planning 10:40. This 10:40 adjusted FDP was only achieved by reducing the ground time in KRR from 1 hour to 45 minutes, completely unrealistic for that airport. During a day flight this could be a tight but acceptable way of planning.  During a night flight this method of pushing to the limit is unacceptable and unsafe. Both captain and FO were called from standby. The original FO called sick at 1500LT, I was called at 1800LT (1:55 before report). If crew control had called me at 1500 to inform me of the night flight I would be assigned to, I could have prepared well by taking a 3 hour nap. The way it went now is that I hadnt slept before the flight and thus was extremely tired after a 11:31 FDP night. Crew control needs to adjust their understanding of human factors.  I am not fit to operate the flight tomorrow morning. I did my best to do my duties the last 2 days after some sleep disruption due to the accident. during my 2 last night flights I managed to get   hours of sleep per day. I came back home today after a long kuwait delayed due to weather in dubai. I Slept 0130 and woke up due to the situation back to my home town related to the the attacks in Brussels. I then couldnt get any sleep up until now (0135 am) In the last 8 days, I have been doing afternoon flights (double sector) followed by night, then morning, then 1 days off followed by night, then night again followed by a early morning that I just cant do.  Originally scheduled to make the flight DXB   MHD   DXB report with time at 11: 55Z, and planned to end duty at 19: 05Z. Flight was cancelled for meteorological reasons. The crew control called me before I left home informing of the cancellation and providing me home stby starting at at the current time of my report Team original flight (11:55 Z). Around 15:40 (L) the control crew called me informing that there was one flight I would have to fly. DXB   BND   DXB   HOF   DXB   HOF report with time at 13:00 (UTC) double sector with estimated time of arrival to 22:20 (UTC) ie for 2:20 (local) so 4:15 minutes longer than planned on my roster. As the flight was one double sector, the maximum duty time would be 10:45, which could fly up to the 23:45Z. Upon arriving at the office, I went to talk to the NCC crew control and said that I was not ready to fly until too late because my original flight would finish at 1905Z. I informed that this time I would not have conditions to help them extending my duty. In BND I called the crew control because the flight at that time was already late 1:30, so the flight I was doing, I’d extend my duty. They were not concerned. After landing at DXB, called once more for the crew control stating that as I told before I was not able to extend my duty, and that as the flight was delayed 1:40 and still would have to change planes, I would not make the flight to HOF. The crew control then decided to put me on the flight to MCT, which delayed more 1:30.  I called the crew control, and once again was ignored, saying that I was not able to bring the MCT flight as I was informed before through telephone calling twice. The control crew told me to go to MCT, which would put an extra crew member to the MCT first morning flight to bring the plane, and wanted me to stay four hours in the plane to return as deadheading. I found this a full absurd and a lack of respect. I realized that the crew control is not concerned about the physical or psychological condition of the crew, since such a situation ends up causing a lot of stress. In my opinion they forced the situation, and I just returning from MCT flying in respect of the crews who were with me. In DXB we landed in and extending the duty was 37 mins. To far not had access to the NCC or call the control crew to sign the discretion.  the crew control must learn and to know that the extension of the duty is to be made sporadically, and that can not be as usual as practice as has happened.  I would suggest a change in the roster when double sector flights. One more time, yesterday, I had to extend my duty in one double sector flight. What has become a common practice in Flydubai, should occur only a few times   …     These are the facts. A flight with only 35 minutes to extend the duty, with change of aircraft on the ground, and two arrivals on Busy Period, the control crew really believe that this flight would arrive on schedule? I do not want to believe that the control crew think this would happen. Sorry to say that, but anyone knows that these would have to extend the duty. With this, I once again as flight commander had to go through the stress of extending the duty, which has become constant practice on Flydubai, reaching always tired. Not to say that I have not tried any action, I even called the control crew   …     and the answer is always the same, “captain I dont have pilots to do this flight” or are not concerned. The moment is to reflect on what happened and how the pilots have flown and the distribution of flight range, which often puts HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the crew, and at the same time gives him a flight early morning or double sector. It would not be too much to ask a little about those who do nothing for the crew. Those who at the time of tightening call us to do a favor. The company is losing the confidence of pilots, and I can feel and see it when I’m flying with colleagues or even having a good conversation   …     it always has the control crew as the end point. Having done FZ xxxon the 25th of march, dealing with a bomb threat. I went into discretion by 1 hour and 20 min bringing my total duty time up to 15 hours and 50 min. I came back to my apartment around 01. 15 and slept until 05. 58.  I haven’t been able to sleep since then..  I called fatigued to Crewcontrol at 1. 30pm local Dubai time. Based on me not being able to sleep, and the past weeks extreme pressure following the crash. I do not feel that I will be able to safely operate an aircraft until I have had a chance to recover. My next duty is set to start on wed the 30th. Which I hope I will be ready for..  Called fatigued for my night TIF due to insufficient rest prior to the duty, the duty was meant to commence at 1950. I finished my previous duty at 2230 on 25th and was in bed for midnight, I slept for approximately 7 hours but this was disrupted, I was unable to get any more rest prior to 1630. I put this down to the change in sleep patterns. I’m unable to operate FZxxx on the evening of the yyth due to safety concerns of fatigue. I called in fatigue on yy because I was unable to sleep after returning to DXB at 0200z. The   flight to and from BTS is crewed with two sets of pilots, yet the cabin only had one set of crew to operate a flight with a limitation of 14:15 and a planned duty of 14:00. The flight departed 45 minutes late. I understand that the reason given, was that there are not sufficient gates available at that time in the morning, to facilitate an   departure. The first passengers arrived 5 minutes prior to the ETD. I understand that the flight was legally planned, but there was no effort, thought or logistics available to achieve the plan. The cabin crew duties for such a flight are exhausting Selling food  duty free, giving out food boxes and then tidying up, all being achieved whilst crossing jet streams with associated turbulence. I believe the seat belt signs were put on by the flight deck operating 785 at least five times. The turbulence reached moderate on a few occasions. (The same occurred on the way back to Dubai and speed was reduced to M. 076 on several occasions.) On arriving at BTS, I took over operation control for the second sector and discretion was discuss with the entire crew.  There was concern among the crew that their energy levels would not be safe, if they entered into discretion. The total duty at the beginning of sector 2 was estimated to be 15 hours.  I relayed this concern to NCC. NCC suggested was the   should be shortened. A departure time in 10 mins and an increase of CI to 150 would avoid entering into discretion. I told them this was unacceptable. At that time, not one passenger had been boarded for FZ786.  Also planning the flight at a CI 150 was totally disingenuous considering the known forecast for turbulence.  NCC disregarded the safety issue presented to them and decided it was purely a mathematical sum to be overcome. As I read the Part A, the published block times should be used for the planning, so suggesting a change in CI to solve the problem was not legal. Also, planning finishes at crew report and any changes that may save time and prevent discretion to be entered, are for the Flight deck to assess ie early departure, shortcuts or flying faster, not NCC and at that time, my assessment was that discretion was unavoidable.  I also have issue with the fact that NCC initially only had one concern and that was to obtain the names of those crew member( s) that considered not exercising their right to use discretion. This is irrelevant. I can only assume it was for unsavoury reasons and is poor practice that should be quashed by management.  Possible Fatigue induced due to   planning by Operational.  Yesterday I and all my crew we where planned to operate a night Astana during the night, reporting at 1555z.  Maximum duty allowed for the cockpit crew was of 1115 that bring our max duty period to end at 0310z. FLIGHT WAS PLANNED TO LAND AT 0310 EXACTLY LEAVING NO SPARE TIME FOR ANY DELAY OR UNPLANNED WHEATEAR, HOLDIG, BOARDING DELAY OR ANYTHING ELSE. BASICCALY EVEN IF ON THE PAPER THE FLIGHT WAS LEGAL WAS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN WITHOUT AN EXTENSION OF THE DUTY PERIOD SINCE THE BEGINNING.  BUT, lets start from the beginning.    fact. In the afternoon I and the Fo both we call the crew control giving an heads up about the flight and the problem that we would have gone to go into if we where operation a flight with such planning of duty. Answer by Ncc was that they would have increase the cost index and reduce the ground time.   fact. Weather at the destination was forecast to be marginal with Fog and very low visibility leading in a possible diversion and in a even worst scenario that the already planned one! Considering the temperature of 4^Celsius and tankering fuel due to a possible diversion a   should have been take into consideration and so the fact that a reduced time on the ground was impossible.   fact. Once we report for our duty, collected the flight plan, we notice that the second flight, was Estimated to arrive in Dubai at 0326. well behind the maximum duty of 0310z. ILLEGAL. I SAY AGAIN. ILLEGAL! !!!! !!!! !!!! !! First sector, likewise the second, was planned to be flown at   and cost index of 150 bringing the flight to land yes 10 minutes early but with no margin on the speed windows and no possibility to avoid weather that last night was forecast along all the route.   fact. Cabin crew missing at the reporting, only 3 cabin crew they were planned to operate this duty and also this was bring into attention of crewing in the afternoon. Additional cabin crew they reported at the aircraft once boarding was already in place.  Now this is the story of how a well establish airline like FZ is planning a flight nowadays but is not the point. I understand the difficulties is going through in this period but is not the point. I know Im nobody to say what should have been done and what people more expert then me they should do, but my Point is that: WHAT IS LEGAL IS NOT SAFE. IS NOT SAFE TO PLANED A CREW TO WORK 11:15 MINUTES IN THE DEEP NIGHT, EXPECT THEM TO SHOT A CAT3 APPROACH, CONTINUE BACK TO DUBAI, MAYBE HOLD, AND LAND, EXTEND THE DUTY AND THEN MAYBE REPORT FOR A NEXT FLIGHT REPORTING NEXT MORNING IN THE EARLY MORNING. IS NOT LEGAL TO PLAN A FLIGHT ALREADY KNOWING THAT THE DUTY WOULD BE EXTEND COVERING THEIR BOTTOM ON THE PAPERS WORK AND SAY, IS LEGAL. IS NOT SAFE TO SAY CAPTAIN IS YOUR DECISION BUT PLEASE TRY TO HELP US, IF U DO THIS IF U DO THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT. ALL THIS KIND OF OPERATIONS IS LEADING INTO FATIGUE AND THERE SHUOLD BE NO ACN TO STOP PEOPLE TO CALL FATIGUE WITH THE FEAR TO LOOS THEY MEDICAL LICENCE BECAUSE THIS IS LEADING IN A EVEN MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION.  After two earlies and one night flight landing at midday today, I really needed to sleep upon arriving home, due to poor sleeping cycles on the last 3 nights. 6 hours later I went to bed trying to sleep for my 3am report, but I was only able to sleep for an hour, thus not enough rest to complete my 9h duty. Rest periods were enough in terms of hours, but timings were hardly manageable to get more than   hours of sleep for two of the last three nights, which made me go to bed after landing today.  Safety Concern  There is a genuine safety concern regarding xxxxx. Over a period of approximately four years there has been four or five rostered duties with the concerned crew member. In summary, it has been witnessed that the crew member displays little or no situational awareness, limited operational understanding, has a tendency to become agitated or inflamed when prompted or asked to act on a parameter and makes excuses and places blame on others when mistakes are made. The crew members’ overall performance during the past rostered duties has been blemished with numerous operational and handling blunders which required immediate intervention to prevent a situation becoming worse.  It is not possible to document every possible event as no record was kept. However with each duty with the mentioned xxxxx, constant supervision is required to ensure flight safety. On one duty returning from Moscow whilst approaching position SAV the senior was summoned to the flight deck to allow a short toilet break and to make a fresh coffee. Upon returning to the flight deck I witnessed the xxxxx did not have their headset on, nor were the speakers switched on. Contact was made immediately with Tehran ATC. During the time the xxxxx did not have the headset placed on, Tehran ATC had been attempting numerous times to contact the aircraft. The xxxxx apologised and remarked that Tehran ATC were not truthful that numerous attempts had been made to contact the aircraft. Recent events highlighted some worrying behaviour. Upon decent into Dubai (OMDW) clearance was given to descend to 9000 ft. Upon levelling out, the airspeed was 260 knots. The xxxxx was prompted to slow the speed down to 250 knots. The reply was along the lines of “250 knots is only a recommendation, the limitation is only 5000 ft”. After an   and uncomfortable exchange, the xxxxx begrudgingly reduced the speed to 250 knots. On final approach into Dubai, tower instructed that after landing vacate at V6. Auto brakes 3 was then selected to allow for the best chance to make the rapid exit. Upon landing the xxxxx applied excessive braking, to the extent which would cause passenger anxiety. “I have control” was commanded twice before a more aggressive tone had to be used for the xxxxx to completely relinquish control. The braking by the xxxxx was excessive and unnecessary. Deadheading crew remarked after landing that the deceleration was quite uncomfortable. On several occasions NCC disturbed me on my days OFF without having volunteer to fly on the day. There where occasions when they called me at 0200 in the morning. This has to stop ASAP. We are working on just the minimum days off in a calendar month and instead of the company tackling the actual problem of hiring more pilots they are trying to over work us and get the job done on minimum crew. Days OFF for us are precious and we need time to relax and spent time with our families. Unable to sleep and have been awake for most of the night. Possible causes are roster, kids and recent events. Fatigued due to impossible change in my body clock. I came home after flight around 00:30LT ( ). Went to bed at 01:00LT, slept 8h, woke up at 09:00LT. Normal person can sleep naturally after being awake  . I had a standby starting at 22:00 which is the time the body need to go sleep. My duty could be extended until 14:15LT which would mean being awake for 29h. Also, after this duty which finishes at 04:01LT the next duty starts at 05:30LT next day which means another 24h body clock change.  This means 2 body clock changes in just 2 days. This is poor rostering, specially if it is occurring while having 1 day OFF in 11 days period.  Having operated 2 disrupted duties in as many shifts, one being an 18. 5 hour duty, which did have the follow duty removed, and then subsequently operating the next assigned duty, i found myself to be extremely tired.  The second duty entailed being 1:37hr in discretion, as the result of a turn back to dubai and then doing our utmost to assist in trying to get the flights done. Sign off in Dubai was 11:17 local. My original roster had me with stby starting at 2000 local. as a result of our delayed return to DXB this was changed to a   stay. When I went to sign the discretion report I informed crewing that I would probably be calling fatigued later in the day if this was to be held.  I did not want to cause any more problems than needed, just wanted to highlight that I was exhausted and if I was unable to get sufficient rest this would be the case.  We came to a solution where i helped by picking up a KHI duty with report of 0650 local on   thus given me every chance to get some decent rest and be fit to fly, which I was.  Prior to operating the     the discretion and fatigue issues were discussed by both myself and fellow flight crew and also with the cabin. At no point did I force anyone to do something they did not want to do. The FO elected to continue, as he could see that by doing so we were doing our bit to try and help out. the cabin crew were not too enthused by running this late, and when given the option to change to a shorter duty with an earlier finish this was taken up. It should be noted that NCC did explore many options to try to mitigate our going into discretion, but were being met with resistance at every turn.  When we arrived at the   the engineer was in the flight deck, and he said that he needed a few minutes to complete his checks. I asked him if the   needed a daily check, and he told me that he was doing it at that time. I asked him if he was alone and how much time he needed cause the flight was already delayed. He said that he was alone and needed about 25 minutes! !! When i spoke to Maintrol office, i asked the shift supervisor of how much time is needed for a daily check to be completed, and he told me about 1:30 hours for 1 man.  If the engineers are 2 or 3, half of that time or even less. So i questioned him how 1 engineer will perform a daily check and a turn around alone, in 25 minutes on our  . He said he will call us back.  Then the engineer came back to the flight deck and told us that he will not perform the daily check after all and they will push it for later on that day. So, if i wasn’t questioning the maintrol, the engineer would have signed an incomplete daily check for our aircraft? ??  Scheduled Duty   I would like to highlight the issues of potential fatigue concerning this particular duty and the circumstances which will impact crew. The duty   DXB  —   TRV  —   DXB starts at a report time of 1920, for me this followed a day off which is fine, however I normally wake at around 9am and it is difficult to get back to sleep before this duty reports although I tried at 3pm to sleep but circadian   pattern prevented me from getting any additional sleep. Therefore by the time I reported I had been awake for 10 hours 20 mins. The duty to TRV is planned to arrive back at DXB at 0615 which realistically for me means 21 hours 15 minutes awake. In reality before we started this particular duty we were delayed 1 hour and then had a further tech delay of 4 hours plus which resulted in the crew operating outbound and positioning on the return which was a total duty of 1537. If the tech issue had of been resolved before the necessity to employ a further crew we could have left going into discretion which would have resulted in an extremely long day for all concerned. I appreciate that it is difficult to resolve the scheduling of this duty, however if it is scheduled on the second duty of a series of over night duties it might help in getting sufficient sleep to enable this duty to be completed with a greater degree of  ? Our operation to Baku currently has us on the ground for a scheduled time of 2   hours. We arrive at 0430 local dubai time and leave at 0700 local dubai time. This is the time when our body is at a circadian low, exactly the time when we should be sleeping. Unfortunately we cannot take proper rest in the aircraft and we are then faced with a 2. 5 hour flight back to Dubai.  Having operated this flight last night I can testify to the fact that this mode of operation is extremely fatiguing for the entire crew.  When we arrived to the approach in Dubai the captain and I were both extremely tired as I’m sure most of the crew usually is when operating this flight. When I asked Ops Control the reason for the extended ground time they said it was ‘a commercial decision based on available slot times in Dubai and Baku’. In light of the current issues we face in this company regarding fatigue and according the SMS chapter 2. 5 I think it is pertinent that a re assessment is made of the impact on safety of this type of unnecessarily long ground times for this and other flights.  Besides the impact on safety, the extended ground time now also poses a security risk with our ACN security   describing escalating tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Having an aircraft on ground any longer than necessary when our security department is issuing an ACN about the same region is, in my humble opinion, a risk.  I was about to report for FZ761B (a requested flight) at 08:15 local, but due my last duty, finished at approx 06:55 local I was not able to get any sleep.  These nigh to day or day to night shifts, really meet up with my body clock in a way I can not get any rest. Its been quite difficult to me to get some rest, my body is taking longer to recover from night duties despite all my efforts (healthy diet, exercise, etc). A night shift disrupt my sleeping pattern in a way that affects my future duties even my days off. I’ve been sick lately due an decrease of my body defenses mainly caused by not resting properly.  It has come to my attention (by other colleagues) that capt xxxxx has a tendency to “touch” the engine start levers   at regular intervals. I have never met the Captain and never flown with him, therefore I can not confirm the aforementioned accusation. If this is not the case I apologize for reporting a colleague, but as this is a “habit” that relates to flight safety I’d rather report it while there still time for corrective actions. I would like to report something that came to my attention for investigation and confirmation. A number of   have come across to inform me that a captain named xxxxx in short intervals taps the start levers in flight with different excuses every time and makes   nervous. I have not seen this, but the fact that more than five   confirmed it is very serious to make an investigation on the issue. Due to having, in the last two days, day flights and landing yesterday at 22:30 Local time and finishing my duty at 23:00, I am unable to change my sleeping and rest patterns in order to report at 00:40 Local time.  I feel unrested and unfit to fly due to the pattern change, and I feel that it would be unsafe to work in this condition  I called fatigued for my night BAH (29) reporting at 23:55 as I hadn’t had sufficient to rest prior to the 1630 cutoff. I finished my delayed   duty at 00. 51 on the xxth and then was given 25 hours rest prior to my scheduled MCT( 41) on 16th reporting at 0225. At 00. 36 on 16th crew control called and told me I was now on a KWI reporting at 0125 giving me 49 minutes until my duty commenced! I felt tired but able to do the newly assigned KWI duty. I finished this duty at 0725 on 16th and only managed to sleep for 3 hours as my body clock was still based upon sleeping during the night   …     In light of this I called unfit due fatigue at 1615 as I felt I would not get sufficient rest prior to my duty commencing at 23. 55.  I feel the main reason for my lack of rest and extreme tiredness is due to the 25 rest period switching me from a day pattern to a nights. 1 night I am going to bed at 2am 24 hours later I am reporting at 2am. It’s a completely unworkable pattern and is extremely fatiguing, combined with an already high workload, 800+ hours a year with double that in duty, these are tiring in themselves and adding poor rostering with   rest periods is too much to ask.  Being standby for 11hrs 30min on the 14th and called out for a flight to SAW coming back after more than 1hr delay at 04:30 then having a KTM simulator the day after from 01:15 till 07:00, caused me to be exhausted, fatigued, need some night sleep and unable to fly another night flight which is KHI reporting at 23:30. A Company Notam for the destination AHB was incorrect because referencing a FIR Notam that did not existed in the FIR notam section the topic was routing and procedure in the SCATANA Area. Upon request of clarification the dispatcher informed us that the referenced notam ( ) doesn’t exist anymore and there is a new FIR notam with a different name, and after this verbal explanation we have been requested for the First time to proceed to the aircraft. I made clear that wasn’t a good practice to leave with incorrect paperwork. The dispatcher then decided to hung up and come to talk to us in person explaining that probably from Nav services no one verified the notams and that Co Notam was expired long tome ago and the new FIR Notam regarding the SCATANA has been changed and no one adjusted the company notam. Once again, for the SECOND time, he requested us to proceed to the aircraft with the incorrect papers. I refused to do it without and adjustment to the briefing pack. shortly after i received a call from this number   …     trying to explain me what we already new, and for the THIRD time, if we could please proceed to the aircraft. It’s then that i felt the need to explain that   paperwork could be a serious finding in case of a Ramp inspection in any place and that myself as a PIC could be liable for accepting it so I said that i wanted an adjusted briefing pack. Only then they offered to send a written amendment via ACARS prior departure. One consideration to be added is that I was called from STBY at 4am (after 20 hours rest from my previous duty and after switching sleeping cycle 4 times in the preceding 7 days) and so was the FO after a busy week himself. weather was marginal around the area, and as a fact descending to FL240 we were in ICING condition and Stormy CLOUDS that were not mentioned on the Weather chart nor Engine Anti ICE was considered in the planned fuel consumption. All this said I thought was UNSAFE and Wrong to be put under all that pressure to leave on time without the serenity we should be entitled prior take people in the air.  Due to rostering and sleep disturbances i was unable to report for duty. Called fatigue as I was unable to rest adequately in between alternating   morning duties. My last duty was a night HYD with reporting time of 1950 local on 21 Apr 2016. After reaching home from this duty I fell asleep around 0800 and woke up 1600.  I went to bed again at 1900 however I was unable to fall asleep and at 0100 I realised that I will be fatigued for my duty to KBL with a reporting time of 0310 on xx Apr 2016. I would’ve been awake for almost 20 hours by the time I would be landing back in Dubai, I did not feel this would be safe. It has been repetitive during this month of April having more than ninety block time the last 28 days (not taking into account five additional simulator hours that happened on the 14th night that are not considered in the total block time computation).  With peaks of 96:08 on the 11th and 98:46 on The 19th. There were also changes in the scheduled    that ended up in two additional STBY days that both were assigned for two different flights, EBL on the 15th and ASB on the 19th. When NCC called on last stand by to report to the ASB flight the   Officer was noticed about me having already 93. 5 hours before duty started on the last 28 days (with no mention about the additional 5 hours of the SIM) and it would turn into a 98. 5 period, but no changes since I believe it was within legality. Today I started another 5 days duty period of day to night swap then minimum rest, and two evenings. After, a single day off to continue with another four days (finally one single day off in ten days duty). I am feeling fit to fly at the beginning of every duty, but in last months in some cases my performance drops dramatically even after asking for controlled rest periods (sometimes more than one in the same flight). I also try my best to manage my rest since at home the feeling of tiredness is continuous, but specially on swapping      …     duties, trying to deal with a family life and having most of the times single days off, it is very difficult to find the way to sleep and rest appropriate time. Multiple mistakes due to fatigue conditions. On assigned service during all flight there was a number of situations like missing items on procedures, erratic actions, missing radio calls and feeling of tiredness and sleepy, although at the beginning of it I was feeling ok. All could be treated as low intensity, but finally so many mistakes can lead to an incident or even an accident. Things to take into account could be the roster: in the last 16 days an average of 93+ hours   the last 28   with peaks of more than 95hrs on six of those days.  Another one is that I was assigned for a long day   one, swapping next day into night and after, minimum rest for this evening duty.  This situation is getting worse with the time that is why I filled an ASR some days ago, and finally today in addition of this fatigue report, I called sick for my next duty. Busy week with 5 long days in a row to include 3 multiple sector days. The last day was another 12 hour day door to door and reaching home just before midnight. Only 2 days off to be followed by a long 14hr day door to door. I woke up early morning around 7am as this is the rythem that the roster leading up to the fatigue call dictated. I tried to rest further in the day but was unable. Leaving me with insufficient sleep for the night flight planned. Long days followed by insufficient rest and a flip to a night flight is the cause for the fatigue. I felt very unrested after the 2 days off as the days leading up were so long. Then to do another 14 hour day and be rested enough for a night flip was always going to be tough.  Duty Changes with short notice and rest planning, I was originally scheduled to fly as A crew to TSE report time of 2010 local. At 1946 crew control called me an advised that I would have to operate both sectors. I pointed out to them that I was not sufficiently rested to do both legs as they were effectively doubling my duty. I was then told that I should always be rested to do both sectors and that crewing did not have enough crew to cover these flights. I then reiterated the point that I was not fit for such a large change in FDP and that I was only fit to fly a flight of similar FDP as the original A crew on the TSE. I was subsequently put on an MUX.  Despite the tone and manner I was spoken to on the phone, I think the key focus of this ASR is the safety issue that needs to be highlighted here. Crew cannot be expected to plan rest on what might happen. I was simply not fit to fly for that amount of FDP.  If the change had been given with sufficient amount of time to take additional rest then I would have been able to safely accept the change.  By crewing’s logic all crews should be rested for any flight, to any destination, with any FDP and be able to accept the change at any time. This is simply not feasible, safe or wise. Furthermore, I would like clarification as to where in our manuals crewing are able to make these large changes to FDP at such short notice and more guidance on flying as A crew, B crew. Whilst small changes in report time or changes onto similar FDP flights are acceptable, no crew can be expected to safely accept changes of such large proportions.  ASR was filed for exceeding 250kts below 5000ft. Safety Dept questioned if this could have been due to tiredness   fatigue. I consulted an AME Psychiatrist at the earliest possible time and he concluded that I am suffering from   fatigue. Probably caused from a Fatigue event in October 2015 and repeated sickness and tiredness since that time. Symptoms increasing until being hospitalised in February 2016 with Exhaustion. Annual Leave and Sickness Leave subsequent to the events failed to solve the fatigue. He recommended to take time off, to be advised by him directly to the Company. I am to attend again at the end of the period to see if further help is needed. AFTER 30 MIN OF FLIGHT THE SENIOR FLIGHT ATTENDANT INFORMED TO US WE HAD A MEDICAL ISSUE ON BOARD WITHIN A FEMALE PAX THAT WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE NORMALLY.  —   BLOOD PRESSURE REPORTED   AND THE PAX APPARENTLY HAVE EXPERIENCED DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS. WE CALLED THE MEDLINK AND ALSO ASKED FOR A DOCTOR ON BOARD FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE OF THE PAX. THE MEDLINK SAID TO PROVIDE ASPHIRIN, OXYGEN AND TO FLAT HER AND WAIT 10 TO 15 MIN TO CHECK HER BLOOD PRESSURE AGAIN. THE DOCTOR ON BOARD SUGGESTED TO DIVERSION, HOWEVER MEDLINK SUGGESTED TO WAIT. AFTER 15 MIN WE CALLED THEM BACK  —   THE PAX SITUATION WAS THE SAME AT THAT TIME  —   THE DOCTOR ON BOARD AND MEDLINK RECOMMENDED TO DIVERT. WE MADE A CONTACT WITH NCC  —   THEY ASKED TO INFORM OUR POSITION AND THE NCC INITIALLY SUGGESTED TO DIVERT TO OIFM OR OISS HOWEVER, WAIT FOR FINAL DECISION. SO, WE DECIDED TO HOLD OVER YZD (ONE HOUR WAY FROM DXB AND TWO HOURS WAY FROM TBS) AND IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY 40 MIN TO THE NCC AND MEDLINK TO INFORM US WHERE TO GO. AFTER OPT CHECK AND WEATHER CHECK WE REALIZED THAT THE OIFM WAS NOT AN OPTION AND OISS WAS PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED  —   WE WERE ALMOST 3 TONS ABOVE MLW AT THAT TIME. MEDLINK CALLED US BACK AND SAID THAT GOING BACK TO OMDB OR OKBK WOULD BE THE BEST OPTION. THUS, WE DECIDED TO TURN BACK AND PROCEED TO DXB.  Approx 1 hour prior to arriving in Dubai we were informed that a male passenger was suffering from a racing pulse, a condition for which he had seemingly been prescribed medication, but which he’d unfortunately left within his jacked pocked, the jacket having been placed within his   baggage (it being now located in the #1 cargo hold). A SatCom call was made to MedLink and the Doctors advice was for the gentlemen (and I kid you not) to purse his lips around his thumb and blow hard and   or to also effect a tensing of his stomach muscles (much as might occur during the act of defecation, I’m not making this stuff, up, as that’s what the Doctor advised) actions which we were assured should help to quell the gentlemen’s racing heart. It transpired that a nurse was also onboard (albeit unfortunately without her formal ID) but she was nevertheless able to take the gentlemen pulse and also his blood pressure, all of which were alarmingly high. After a period of approx 15 minutes, during which the afore mentioned ‘treatment’ was enacted, the nurse again assessed the gentlemen’s condition and it seemed that there had been little, if any, improvement. By this point we were in the descent in Dubai and it seemed that holding was likely at DESDI. So ATC were informed that we had sick passenger onboard and they asked if were we declaring an emergency?   …     and so, to avoid delay, a PAN call was made. UAE  Dubai Approach   Tower   Ground controllers were their usual superlative best, providing us with particular expeditious routing. Top class stuff! DNATA  FZ NCC were also contacted and advised that we had a sick passenger on board and a request was made for Paramedics to meet the aircraft, including a request for steps to be attached as soon as possible after our arrival on stand. All went swimmingly, that is until we arrived on stand only to then suffer a 2 minute delay, caused by no one from DNATA being available to drive the steps up to the aircraft. The gentlemen was eventually taken into the ambulance by the paramedics. We also recovered the gentlemen’s suitcase from the #1 hold and were able to pass his medication to the paramedics. Change of PIC with deadheading crew from IEV  During the flight back from IEV in the last hour of the flight Captain decided to use the lavatory. at this time Fo xxxxx was in the cockpit so he acted as the cover crew while Capt. Stepped out. after just few seconds the Lavatory door was fully opened and I could see partially in the camera that Capt. is sitting there surrounded by 4 cabin crew members. at this point I found out that he is not feeling well and I called the Cabin Crew Via Interphone to ask for further detail. she Informed me that he is suffering a low blood Pressure. after assessing the situation I decided to ask for the Dead heading Pic to enter the cockpit so we can continue with the safe operation. He entered the cockpit and Informed me that He saw Capt. was not in good condition. as a joint agreement the call was made to NCC via Satcom and the decision was made so Captain yyyyyy continue as the PIC to complete the Flight. after 15 minutes Capt. entered the cockpit and declared he feels better and he wanted to switch again with Capt. yyyyy but he was offered to relax more in the business class until we land in DXB.  FZxxx had an inflight declared Pilot Incapacitation as per the following sequence of events: 1. Flight was dispacthed with 2 sets of flight crew (4 pilots) and 1 set of Cabin crew (5 Flight attendants). 1 set of flight crew deadheading on 1° sector and operating on the way back and the other set vice versa. 2. FZxxx departed from IEV exercizing discrection due to delay on 1° sector and flight departed without issues.  3. During flight, Captain ate a sandwich (purchased in FZ cafeteria) and felt a different taste that was not strange enough to alarm him in order to stop from eating it  4. One and half hour after this, approximately after passing abeam KWI (more or less 1 hour to ARR in DXB) Captain left the cockpit to go to toilet for phisiological needs. 5. In the toilet, Captain felt nausea and little dizziness that last for about 2 min. Captain called Cabin crew in front galley to assist him with a glass of water and a little amount of salt, just in case it could be a low pressure peak. Cabin crew offered a chocolate in case of low sugar level and was also accepted by the Captain. 6. Cabin crew started their procedures questioning Captain to assess the situation. Captain aswered all the questions and never fainted or lost consciousness. Just rested seated with the head up to avoid vomiting. After 3 minutes, Captain was felling 100% again, but remained in the toilet resting for more 2 minutes. 7. During the time spent in toilet, operating FO saw through security camera the Cabin Crew assisting Captain and called the deadheading Captain to replace him in the cockpit. 8. Deadheading Captain took controls 9. Captain now was feeling 100% yet a little pale in the face but recovering and wanted to return to duty. Cabin crew insisted in take the blood pressure measurement first, which was accepted. Also asked Capt if wanted Medlink to be called, which had a negative answer from Captain, as he was felling fully recovered. 10. Pressure was obtained ( ) and Captain said that usually his blood pressure is normally on the lower side and that was normal for him and he felt OK to return to duty. 11. Cabin crew insisted that Captain to rest a little more in bussiness class seat for 5 minutes, since there was another Captain in the cockpit and we had time as we were far from ARR. Captain accepted the suggestion to rest further 5 min to make sure he was able to return to duty. 12. As all this time Captain felt better and fully recovered, he decided to return to cockpit. 13. Captain entered the cockpit and informed deadheading Captain that he was fully recovered and could return to his duty. 14. Deadheading Captain insisted in an informal way that Captain should not be worry and could rest in the back. Captain, then, insisted in returning to duty when was informed that a “decision has been made and NCC already swaped the Captains” 15. Captain accepted the decision and asked if he could stay in the observer seat from that moment onwards. Deadheahing Captain (in contols) agreeded and flight continued 16. During descent, it was informed that an ambulance was called upon arrival and Captain asked to cancell it, as he felt 100% and it was unnecessary in his opinion. Ambulance was canceled. 17. ATC asked if FZxxx wanted to call for emergency, but operating crew said “no” and flight continued uneventful till landing.  18. After landing Captain went upstairs to NCC to ask the reason for NCC decision to swap Captains, and only at that time Captain was informed that deadheading Captain had declared “Pilot Incapacitation” and NCC was only informed about the scenario. Because of that, NCC coordinated priority for landing for FZxxx 19. Captain returned downstairs and meet the crew for debriefing, 20. Captain was initially removed from next duty and put on SICK till next morning meeting with Flight Operations Representatives, During cruise the senior cabin crew called the flight deck and informed there was a lady on board not feeling well. She was 85 years old and experienced a shortness of breath and vomiting, senior informed us that he was going to call medlink. A few minutes later the senior came to the flight deck and informed us that the satcom mobile phone did not have a signal, so he explained the state the passenger was in and gave us the medlink form. I told him to go check on the passenger while I tried to contact medlink. It took a while to get hold of medlink, after the first contact the line got broken, on the third attempt we got a good connection with medlink.  Just before we were able to connect to medlink, the senior called us back and informed us that the passenger had stopped breathing and they could not find the pulse, so they had actioned CPR, the automated external defibrillator was showing no life, shock not recommended. They also had a doctor onboard which was assisting them. We shortly after got hold of MEDLINK and explained the situation, they advised us to continue to KHI while doing CPR, and said the doctor should give the adrenaline shot. All this was going on around in KHI FIR, around position LATEM, and we declared mayday and got highspeed and vectors into KHI. I was informed the crew performed CPR for approximately 45minutes, unfortunately the passenger could not be saved. The cabin crew did a very professional job and their teamwork was outstanding. We had a talk on the ground in KHI about the experience and how they were feeling, everyone was fit to fly home.  this report is written in Colaboration eoth SCCM On flight 633 from   on AC   a xxxxx passenger seated in xxxxx complained to CCM about chest pain and shortness of breath and difficulty breathing at approx 0638z (1:38 hours onto the flight). The SCCM and CCMs found three doctors on board who then assisted in providing Oxygen and assistance to the passenger. Flight crew was informed of situation in a timely manner. SCCM then was to contact Medlink as per policies and procedures and get authorization as demanded by the doctors on board, whom stated at the xxxxx passenger was ‘more than 85% chance of having a stroke’. The symptoms were once again shortness of breath, chest pain, no medications or previous medical history. If the SCCM and CCM did not help and allow access to the EMK he would take legal action and sue the crew and airline. Passenger was moved to J class third row. We informed the Doctor that we had to get clearance from Medlink to open and dispense any drugs in flight to the passenger. At this point the Captain made the call to Medlink via NCC as the hand help telephone was not working properly and hence the flight crew had to call from the flight deck. At approximately 0655z we contacted Medlink via phone patch (case # BMDC071174) with NCC and stated the above facts. In the meantime due to pressure and threats from the Doctor on board, the CCM gave a copy of the list of items in the Emergency fly away medical kit. The doctor said that he wanted to dispense item number   Nitrolingual spray 400 mcg to the patient.  We established the call with Medlink and were told that due to his age and no previous history, to give him two paracetamol tablets and continue the oxygen. The call was then dropped at 0703z. Called back at 0705z. At 0713z the Doctor then demanded to speak to me on the intercom. He stated that it was an 85% chance that the passenger was having a heart attack. I listened to him. He stated that if we did not take action that he would sue all of the crew and myself and the company as we were ‘not doing anything to help the man’. I stated that we were all following company policy and procedures and needed to get clearance and medical advise from Medlink. It was my responsibility as the Captain to follow these procedures. He then continued to talk over me. I simply asked him if he would allow me to talk. I asked three times and then he hung up on me! I asked the SCCM to tell him that I simply needed the vital signs of the passenger so that I could then make another call to Medlink via NCC. He delayed this process by being rude and hanging up on the Captain. At 0722z we were updated with the vital signs (BP   and a pulse of 82) and was told that pain was increasing. At 0726z Medlink authorized the Crew to let the Doctor on board give one   to the passenger and all if condition worsened. At 0732z we were informed by the SCCM and the Dr that medication was given and should be ‘fine’ in a few minutes. At 0740z passenger was ‘fine’.  In range to KRT destination preventive medical assistance was requested from KRT tower. At 0857z we landed and were on blocks at 0902z. Medical personnel boarded and examined passenger, and stated he was fine and would further examine him at their facilities and request him to go see a medical doctor. He disembarked via high lift and then went with medical personnel in ambulance. He further argued with personnel on the ground. The assisting Dr________ left via the high lift with his elderly family member that had requested a wheel chair. Captain called Medlink and gave them update of above statement and added the fact at the passenger was overweight and not in shape for the record. NCC was also called and stated operation was n  On final approach into KHI ILS 25L at 2nm from the runway on our left side approx 2nm away a bright white serach light was pointed at the aircraft and tracked us to the runway. It was intense enough to not look at directly. KHI ground comtrol was informed and they said they would take appropriate measures. On approach RW30L DXB a green laser light was shone at the aircraft from the left side. The area was identified as in the vicinity of Academic City. ATC advised. Green laser light shone deliberately at our aircraft on the approach into Karachi. The issue was raised with ATC (Karachi Approach) who said they would investigate the matter further.  On final ILS25L in KHI, between 1500ft and 500ft AGL, a green laser pointed the cockpit several times. The position from which the beam flashed was approximately 3NM from IQA (ILS 109. 7) 0. 5NM left of RWY25L extended centerline. This information was reported to Karachi TWR. No further problems encountered. On approach to Taif almost intercepting the fila approach a Laser beam was pointed at the aircraft form a bi building all lit up by LED decorative lights. the laser did’t enter the flight deck but was clealy pointed at the fuselage. After   from DXB, we were flying the RIKET SID. When we passed 10000” we heard a loud impact sound from the left side of the fuselage. After this, we recognized it was a high altitude bird strike. We checked all the systems, engines parameters and the pressurization and we decided to continue our flight towards HYD and where we landed safely, uneventfully. On the stand we inspected the bird impact with my   and after that we called maintroll and techlog entry was taken. Maintroll dispatched the aircraft to home base. Return flight to DXB was uneventfull.  Suspected Birdstrike on final approach at approx. 1. 000 ft AGL. Approach continued. All parameters normal. Birdstrike inspection carried out after landing iaw AMM. NIL findings, no evidence of damage, engine core ingestion and no change in engine parameters. ADD raised for   at base DWC.  We were in the short final at altitude 300ft agl when an unidentified bird hit the fuselage above windshield. No visible damage. Marked on the tech log.  Hit large raptor like bird on departure from rwy 25L in KHI. No parameter shift on indications. After landing large dent on no 1 engine Nacelle. Tech log entry made an main troll informed. At approx 300’ on approach runway 16 a flock of birds were seen flying across the approach path. An    approach was initiated with the intent of avoiding flying through in the event of a continued landing. On initiation of the   at least one bird was hit, altitude approx 400’. During the missed approach, on level off with autopilot engaged the autopilot failed to capture the set altitude. A manual correction to this was made and. Autopilot reconnected. We were then told to plan ILS 17. We subsequently set up and flown as planned. However, when cleared to intercept, we failed to get a LLZ capture. We were quizzed by ATC, and told them we were correcting, only to have the same thing happen a second time. At this time we asked servicibility of the ground unit, to be told it was not active. We elected to break off the approach and requested to fly ILS16. A runway inspection was carried out, we planned and flew the approach with no further complications. On inspection of aircraft after landing there was observed a considerably dent to the random right hand side. Inspection requested by approved personnel, and aircraft was deemed AOG.  During takeoff from RW14 in DAC after V1 during rotation we experienced a bird strike on ENG #1. Heavy smell of burned bird felt in the cockpit and during climb engine vibration was experienced up to 3. 8. High engine vibration NNC performed and thrust reduced to to minimum acceptable. Vibration always kept below 3. 0 during the rest of the flight. NCC was contacted and decition to continue to Dubai was made. CC informed and NITS briefing performed. Safe continuation of the flight and safe landing performed in DXB.  At liftoff from RW09 a white object was seen passing the left window and shortly after a smell of cooking. A bird strike was suspected and engine parameters regularly observed during the climb. All was normal and the flight continued to DXB without event. The tower at DYU were informed of a suspected bird strike and a tech log entry made on arrival in DXB.  a drone flying straight and level was observed flying parallel to runway 30L in dubai at 3 miles on final segment to the left side, 1000 feet height, lateral separation around 100 meters from the airplane surroundings of mirdiff. ATC was informed and aircraft performed a normal approach besides that. On final approach to Rwy 09 (radar vectors) we heard a quite distinct noise in the flight deck. On PDI we found trace of a confirmed bird strike on the radome and we suspected bird ingestion by the right engine. We didn’t see any changes on the engine parameters nor smell any funny burnt odor form the conditioning system. The suspect was due some trace that could not be properly identified on the engine cowl and on one of the fan blades during the PDI. Picture were taken and sent to maintrol. They organized the assistance of a qualified engineer that performed a thorough inspection to the aircraft and signed of the aircraft with a one off authorization.  BIRDS OBSERVED ON BACK TRACK FROM HGA. REQUESTED BIRD SCARING PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM RW06. BIRDS STILL OBSERVED TOWARDS THRESHOLD OF RW24 AND BELIEVED WE HAD A STRIKE ONCE AIRBORNE. IMMEDIATE SMELL OF BURNT MEAT AND NUMBER 1 ENGINE SHOWED VIBRATION OF UP TO 1. 5 UNITS. ALL OTHER PARAMETERS NORMAL SO FLIGHT CONTINUED TO DUBAI. THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY INSPECTION IN DUBAI AND BIRD STRIKE CONFIRMED ON THE NUMBER 1 ENGINE WITH DAMAGE FOUND TO THE NUMBER 12 N1 BLADE WITH POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO OTHERS. BIRD PARTS SEEN IN INLET AND EXHAUST AREA OF ENGINE. UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE. Just after pushing back from the stand and as we were about to start engines, the SCCM called from the cabin and informed us that a passenger is shouting at the cabin crew very loudly and appears to be heavily drunk.  I immediately got the push back stopped and got the aircraft pulled back into the stand in coordination with Colombo ground.  I asked for immediate presence of Police at the gate. The passenger was escorted out of the aircraft by police and his hand baggage plus his checked baggage removed from the cargo hold. I ordered a new and complete safety and security check of the aircraft by the cabin crew along with identification of each hand bag by individual passengers. After the completion of security procedures the flight was commenced and completed without any further disruption. NOTE: I was told by senior on return to Dubai was that the cabin crew did notice this passenger being drunk while boarding but they did not bother informing the captain. Please investigate that why such an obvious drunk passenger got through the check in gate and then into the aircraft?? The cabin crew must be advised to be vary of such passengers and they MUST bring any unusual happening to the notice of captain in time. This disruption could have been avoided by efficient checking at gate   or at least while boarding. Go Around at aprox 2000 due to cabin no longer being secure.  Pax got up and went to the toilet, was repeatedly asked to return to seat as we were about to land, and chose to ignore all instructions from cabin crew and general P. A made bt me from the flight deck Go around was carried out after confirming with cabin crew cabin was no longer secure. Resequenced and carried out subsequent approach to land with n o further issues. Security was requested to meet the aircraft on stand, and passenger was dealt with by them. The flight was Initially delayed out of Dubai due to boarding and ATC. Managed to get a few short cuts and arrived in to KRR [Krasnodar] a few minutes early. Aircraft was refuelled and inspected within 20 minutes of arriving, it was noted that the aircraft’s wings would need   due to cold soak fuel frost. FZ ground staff at KRR informed the captain of 1 inadmissible passenger, told they would take approximately 10 minutes to process and would then be sent out to the aircraft, at this stage this did not appear warrant any concern of delaying the flight. The 1 inadmissible passenger then became 2 and finally 4. It was quite apparent that the initial 10 minute estimate was wildly inaccurate and that the flight would be heavily delayed waiting for the passengers. During the delay 2 female passengers called CCM via the crew call button, they complained about the   mix of the crew and said ‘why aren’t there more Russian crew on the flight?’ The crew member asked the passengers to behave, they were clearly drunk and didn’t listen. The passengers then called CCM and verbally (racially) abused her, telling her to @#$%^. While taking off from OIKB significantly more elevator was required to unstick the nose for rotation than is normally needed. Once rotation was achieved, the yoke felt very heavy and I (FO) used stabilizer trim to ease the elevator force. Once my flaps were up the trim indicated 10. 3 units of nose up trim. During the rotation, the yoke travel felt very close to full travel to achieve the proper rotation rate. I gave control to the captain so he could evaluate the situation and he agreed that there was a serious imbalance in the aircraft. The flight controls felt normal and it was determined that it must be an issue with the cargo load. Other than the abnormal trim required the aircraft flew normally and we continued to DXB.  The Loadsheet indicated there were 3400 Kg of Truffles loaded. 600 kg in C2 and 2800 kg in C3 with 24 bags in C4. The picture attached shows where all the cargo and bags were located in the aft pit. It does not look like there was 2800 kg of truffles in C3. and the bags were not secured in C4. This condition may have led to the nose heavy CG. The forward pit was pretty close to being bulked out so I did not include a picture. After landing we contacted NCC and asked that someone come out and verify the load. In the Picture attached of C3 there was no cargo or bags aft of what you see in the picture. Marshalling at Juba, After landing, we backtracked and vacated runway 13 via taxiway C. Marshaller was insight and i taxied the airplane to position for parking in accordance with marshaller guidance.  As i approached the parking area i noticed that the marshaller is guiding us onto a parking position that would cause us to maneuver the airplane outside protected area and expose part of the port wing outboard of engine #1 to rest over active service road in front of fire station. I could not accept parking in the position given by the marshaller because due to the following reasons: (Please refer to attached photos in pdf) 1. Port wing would be resting over active service road used by vehicles and equipment (risk of collision) 2. Very tight maneuvering will be required to taxi out of the given parking position for the next crew and movement over unprotected surface will be involved (wingtip clearance during the turn) 3. Close proximity to fire station which in case of any required emergency movement can cause difficulty for fire trucks movement (restricted paved surface). Both myself and the First Officer requested the marshaller several times using hand signals to move slightly inwards into the apron but he insisted that we should taxy towards his position. After trying for about 5 minutes with him without success i requested in coordination with ATC to turn and park at current position, taking into consideration that we would not be blocking any aircraft or personnel movements or cause any issues to other aircrafts or ATC After shutdown i requested to speak with the marshaller. When i met him he was upset and did not even want to listen to my explanation commenting stuff like “he is in charge” and i should follow his marshaling instructions “without asking or questioning” and that “when i am in Juba i should follow his rule”. He claimed that we blocked other aircraft which was certainly not the case as movement on the apron went on as normal including large Antonov aircraft movement. Since the conversation was not going anywhere i informed him that i will be filing an ASR detailing the incident. I would also like to reiterate that the same issue occurred on my previous flight to Juba but the marshaller at the time was more cooperative allowing us to park as requested. Incidentally: When i was trying to take photos of the parking position of Flydubai aircraft I was stopped by security saying that i am not allowed to take any photos and i will be risking detention if i do so again. I hope the above report can contribute to safer operation at Juba airport  Pilot flying forgot to release the parking brake for takeoff. Config warning sounded, brakes released, normal takeoff followed.  Qatar Airways refuelling during thunderstorm, Qatar airways A320 parked next to our plane was refuelled during a thunderstorm with lightning over the airfield. I was waiting for the storms to pass but the Qatar plane didnt. When I questioned the captain his response was he just needed a quick 500kg, thinking that it would be ok. The fuel company al maha when questioned said that the captain had requested it so they had to do it. I felt this was a very unsafe thing to do and they had no real understanding of the potential implications of the situation. I delayed over 45 minutes before myself and the first officer felt it was safe to refuel our plane.  Hi Kind of a bad approach in KTM yesterday. It started out by ATC wanting us to do a VOR to rwy 02. Wind was reported   kts. We can only do 10 kts tail wind in ktm. We asked for a circling, but with the option to land on RWY 02 when we came down to minima and the wind was below 10 kts. On final KTM wanted us to circle to the right of the rwy, we several times told them that we can only do circling to the left of the rwy. So busy on the radio, coming down the path. We did turn left at KTM 2 miles, hdg 337 for 20 sec, then hdg 022, abm the threshold timing was done at 10 sec (not 15, due to tailwind) we had to stay within the 4 nm circle of KTM. I started descend, disconnected   and continued descend. We had one bank angle and 2 sink rate aural warnings. We were fully VMC so I continued. The approach leaves you 3 times high than a normal 3deg. ILS app. At one mile from the rwy on the circling app you are at 800 somthing feet, on a normal ILS you would be at 300 feet. On the VOR to 02 KTM we do get glideslope warning the last 2. 5 nm if we increase our rate of descent, and thats normal in KTM. Now I could see that we where high, but was not expecting to have that steep angle to the rwy. So rate of descent was high, and triggered the aural sink rate twice. I don’t see how that app can be flown without getting the warning or at least close to getting it. Its steep, its close to the mountains, and its an approach I have only done once in the sim   years ago. I was not comfortable doing it. A sink rate warning can be disregarded if you are VMC and comfortable to continue, but we did get it close 300 feet also. This really bugs me, either is was late starting my descent, we where to close or something else. We should probably have done a go around, but that would have ended up in a diversion and a layover somewhere. (I know thats not an excuse, but its still in your mind somewhere when making your split second decision) Its a complex situation and you know you will get yelled at from the company if that would be the case. I would like your response to the incident and your thoughts on that app, am I the only one with this view or has other people raised their concern etc. Next time the offer a circling to RWY 20 I will probably decline, and rather diverte. Its not worth it..  ASR ATC Baghdad Wind   vis 10k m Baghdad ATC AND tower, We asked for runway 33R but our request were denied. We asked for the reason why we could not land 33R and ATC replied due to tailwind. We inform them that the current wind was 10kts tail wind and that we can accept up to 15kt tailwind. The ATC asked us why we are forcing to land in bad weather and that they know about our accident and they are worried for us. When we finally got ILS 33R the tower switched off the ILS and told us we have to land runway 15L because the ILS is not available. We then asked for the VOR 33R it was approved but later on the tower turn the ILS back on again and told us that the ILS is now available, however we reclined and continued the VOR approach for runway 33R. The workload became high since the Tower denied our request and kept disturbing us with different type of clearances. Also the statement from ATC that the knew about a our accident and they were worried for us made both me and the FO very uncomfortable to the point we started to get worried about the approach.  Severe turbulence encounter during descent  During descent to Kuwait and at FL300 between positions SOLEM and KUMBO we encountered severe turbulence for duration of approximately 1 minute, the instruments were completely unreadable. During the entire flight we had encountered moderate turbulence   due to weather and Jetstream presence. Supplementary procedure for Turbulence was applied and request for descent made to Bahrain, passing through FL250 the turbulence subsided. Tech log entry was made, refer FDR02323 and MCC organized maintenance inspection by external engineer from NAS in Kuwait. Thorough inspection was made and aircraft was cleared. Nothing further to report  Severe Clear Air Turbulence  While cruising at FL370 over Iranian airspace, approximately near to waypoint GODNA, in clear VMC, no weather radar return ahead and nearby, a rapid onset of severe turbulence occurred from steady flight condition with abrupt increase in airspeed quickly towards MMO, and pitch up onset estimated up to 10 degrees. I was PF (Captain) i disconnect   and   due to severe turbulence and extreme bumping no mode control panel selection was possible to engage so i disregarded   inputs left on VNAV PATH. Expeditious pitch attitude and thrust correction where made to try to remain within flight envelope. Aircraft was uncontrollable at time for   seconds every now and then. Total duration probably around one and half minute. Request descend to lower level cause not possible to keep altitude and difficult control on roll as well. Seat belt sign was turned ON as the onset occurred. After around 1 and half minutes able to regain complete control of aircraft and level at FL350. At the onset of the severe turbulence we were flying at FL370, while the OFP was planned at FL390 and at that moment the MAX cruise level reported by the FMC was FL395 due buffet limitation. On top of that we choose to keep a lower cruise speed of Mach . 78 compared to the ECON suggested by the FMC of . 789. No report of turbulence was received and encountered and shear on OFP was showing 3 to 1, while wind was steady at around  . Plane didn’t went in MMO (no clacker sounded) and remain at time sligltly above lower amber band, but was very difficult to control around all axis with abrupt speed variations of +  20 kts and excursion of pitch up and down of more than +  degrees. Speedbrake use momentary not to exceed MMO. PM did a very good support calling all deviations and coordinating with ATC. No nearby aircarft was flying at the moment. With aircraft now under control, an assessment was done,   and   engaged and cruise speed of mach . 76 selected. Cabin crew were contacted to assess their situation as well as the passengers.  Nobody was hurt but scare was among passenger. I made a PA to reassure the passengers explaining that the situation was under control. Rest of the flight went uneventful. Tech log entry for severe turbulence made upon arriving in DXB and maintroll advised. ATC advised later other aircrafts about the CAT.  Lost comms into Afghanistan  All flights into and out of Afghani airspace constantly fly without being in communication with the relevant station. Speaking to an air traffic controller working for Kabul approach who happened to be on our flight, this has been an issue for a long time and is due to some transmitters being out of fuel. See NOTAM   and  . A simple refueling of these booster stations would prevent any incident where an aircraft might be out of   and has a problem which requires immediate assistance. Consider the high terrain in the area. Problems persist on the   route portion and the   route portion.  There must be an easy solution would could avert a possible accident. pack of 5 big dogs at taxiway b just after the main apron in mashad airport, we have informed the tower, which told us the dogs were not going to be a threat for our airplane and that a runway inspection was just carried out and runway was clear i think they might have trained the dogs not to move while airplanes are in movement at that location! There is a fence in the perimeter of the airdrome, and i believe the dogs are tenants there. Yes, it is a joke to receive such communication from the tower, never assuring that the animals were going to be removed from there. Whilst doing my welcome on board PA with the aircraft almost ready to depart, a passenger approached the cabin crew and asked why the Captain announced he was going to SKT and not Karachi as per his ticket. Passenger ticket indeed confirmed a booking for FZ331 to Karachi on the same day. FZ331 leaves 15 minutes after FZ337 to SKT. flydubai ground staff, NCC and police informed and the passenger was offloaded together with his 2 checked in bags. Cabin crew asked to search around the area where the passenger was seated and identify the hand baggage in the area’s overhead lockers. Flight took another 30 minutes delay as a result of this. The passenger explained that he bought the ticket last minute at the flydubai reservations desk in T2. While refueling the aircraft, I noticed 6 large wooden boxes being loaded into Compartment 3. Each box took   big men to lift it. After fueling I checked the hold  found that all boxes had been grouped together at the front of the compartment and were not evenly distributed. Even more worryingly, none of these boxes were fastened to the aircraft. I asked for them to be lashed down, and on checking found a man tying a rope around the group of boxes, but still no netting or other equipment to contain the load! The effect of this load moving in the climb out or in flight doesn’t bear thinking about! !!  Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication  Accidentally entered Saudi airspace without communication. Contributing Factors: Busy avoiding weather before FIR entry. Missed frequency change from Bah 127. 525 (not sure if occured). Both myself and FO believed we were in contact with Jeddah but actually we had not checked inFinally heard Jeddah 133. 800 call us on guard. Checked in and immediately apologised regarding the confusion. On the return 878 we contacted Jeddah and he stated that everthing was fine.  Drifting slightly into Iranian airspace to avoid weather  When we were approaching reporting point NADSO on airway B505, we had thunderstorm cells overhead NADSO and the south side of our route at flight level 290. We requested a higher level to avoid this weather, but it was not possible due to traffic. We knew that Iranian airspace was quite close to the airway from looking at our route charts (we were flying with aircraft   which has no installed ipads) and that point, the only way we could avoid flying into a very bad thunder storm cell, was to turn north. We got approval from muscat to avoid weather and head northbound.  We did our best to estimate the EXACT location of the Iranian boundary from observing the route chart, and attempted to stay as close as possible to the correct airway and at the same time maintain safe flying conditions.  Immediately after passing this thunder storm cell, we measured the distance on the route map with a plotter and became aware that we had been in Iranian airspace maximum 5 miles. We also confirmed the same with Muscat control. Tehran   or control did not call us on 121. 5 frequency at any time.  No further actions were made in this case. "
"No one knew much, but the crowd was growing. We were at the rest stop off Highway 29 between Eden and Pelham, where North Carolina meets Virginia, and everyone was looking for the Ku Klux Klan. It was 8. 40am. The day after the election of Donald Trump, the Loyal White Knights of Pelham, a chapter of the KKK with a suitably unhinged website, had announced that they would be holding a victory parade on 3 December. In the weeks since, there had been no word on the Knights’ website or anywhere else about when or where the parade would be. But the initial declaration was perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of what we might call the New Emboldening  —   a    rise in everyday American racism and bigotry spurred by the rhetoric and election of a billionaire who had taken swipes at certain   and all Mexicans, certain women and all women, certain   and all Muslims, all African Americans and all immigrants. In the month after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center had tracked more than 900 incidents targeting  . A Muslim college student in Ann Arbor had been told, by a young white man, to remove her hijab or he would light her on fire. At a Utah high school, two   sisters were told by their white classmates, “You get a free trip back to Mexico. You should be happy. ” The idea of a Klan rally in this kind of atmosphere was potentially explosive. The KKK had demonstrated a year earlier, in Columbia, South Carolina, and the results had been ugly. Three hundred Klan members had been there. The New Black Panthers had countered with 400 of their own members. In all, there were 2, 000 protesters. There were cops in body armour. Ripped Confederate flags. A grandmother with a bloody nose. A Klan member, trying to flee in his vehicle, ran into a lamppost. This 3 December parade, then, coming after Trump’s election and during this New Emboldening, had the potential to be far worse. The promise that the parade was coming was a blight on the soul of the nation the vast majority of the country, whether they supported Trump or not, dreaded it. There is no more wretched and horrifying segment of the American people or history than the Klan, who in their darkest years had lynched black men and women and had terrorised anyone who wasn’t white or Christian. At their height, in 1924, the Klan’s membership was 4 million. In 2016, estimates put their strength at no more than 8, 000. But Trump, like a snake charmer, had coaxed the rise of the “ ” who embodied the spirit of the Klan, but in different robes and with better social media. And because the depth of Trump’s support  —   so much of it invisible to polls and data  —   had shocked much of the nation, there existed the possibility that the Klan, too, would emerge with far greater numbers than anyone thought possible. But for a month, no one knew where the rally would take place. Activists marked it on their calendars but had no clue where to go, other than Pelham, North Carolina  —   a tiny town of 3, 592 souls, with no central business district through which to parade. The night before, I’d driven around Pelham and found nowhere a potential parade might happen. Guessing the Klan might be gathering at the home of Amanda and Christopher Barker, the only Knights listed on their website, I drove past the home listed as their address. It was a humble clapboard house in nearby Eden. There were no cars parked outside, no sign of an assembling of regional racists. Then, late on the night of 2 December, an article appeared on the website of the   of Burlington, North Carolina. A reporter there, Natalie Janicello, spoke with a Loyal White Knights representative who called himself the chapter’s “exalted cyclops”. He confirmed that the Klan would indeed parade. Probably at 9am, he said, and in the vicinity of Pelham. So here we were, at the rest stop, waiting for word. The sky was grey and the temperature hovered at 40F. Cars continued to arrive, and their passengers disembarked to use the facilities. Most were young and dressed in black boots, pants, hoodies and sunglasses. A few were wearing bandanas to cover their faces. These were   activists  —   some anarchist, some communist, some apolitical  —   in general more willing to engage in confrontation and property damage (thus the efforts to anonymise themselves). There were six of them. Then 10. Then 20. Thirty. They made up the largest group of the assembling activists, but there were also members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) a few people with Black Lives Matter signs, and a smattering of unaffiliateds  —   men and women, most of them under 30, standing in the cold, waiting for word of when and where. But 9am was fast approaching and there was no update. I befriended a trio of activists who seemed to have the most    information. Megan Squire, a   professor of computing sciences at nearby Elon University, was earnest and funny and determined to confront the Klan. She was with her husband, Tony Crider, a professor of physics, who, in   and a leather jacket, was a bit more detached and sceptical (for reasons that would become clear later). With them was Sugelema Lynch, a     teacher from nearby Alamance County. “I’m more of a ” she said. She was wearing a   scarf and   sneakers, and had an enormous camera around her neck. “I just want to get a couple cool photos and tell my kids, ‘Look what I did this weekend! ’” She had moved from California five years earlier, when she’d married a man who grew up nearby. She was still getting used to this   state, whose Latino population had grown from 76, 000 in 1990 to 800, 000 in 2016. “When I first moved here,” she said, “living in the Burlington area, you just felt the tension. As a Hispanic woman, just walking around felt awkward. ” She is one of two Latino teachers at her elementary school, where most of the students are the children of Latino immigrants. “It’s not really a surprise to hear about the Klan here. Things don’t ever just go away. But I’m not offended just looking at the Confederate flag. I grew up watching The Dukes of Hazzard, too. ” Megan was periodically checking in with the IWW and   groups, and returned with news. “OK,” she said. “The rumour now is that the Klan is organising itself, planning to go to Danville via Highway 29. Everyone’s trying to find someone who might have a car shitty enough to block the highway. ” Danville was a city of 43, 000, just over the Virginia border. It had been on the list of possible sites for the Klan march. As we waited, Tony told a story of a recent   incident on the Elon campus. The day after the election, he had arrived at his classroom to find the words “Bye bye Latinos. Hasta la Vista” written in large letters on his whiteboard. There had been recent activity in the area by another   supremacist group called Actbac (Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County) and Tony thought this might have something to do with them. Deciding to make it a teachable moment, he took a picture of the board and posted it on his Facebook account. When his first class arrived that morning, he left the words up. He asked the students to write down their thoughts on the election and drop them in a bin, so each student’s opinion would remain anonymous. (He planned to read them aloud a week later, when they had some distance.) He taught the class as planned, then went back to his office, closed the door, and cried. Meanwhile, his photo had been shared with a student reporter at Elon, who tweeted it. That tweet was retweeted 2, 000 times, and by the next day, it had been reported in the Daily Mail and the Associated Press. It was referenced all over the world. “Then we found out it was a hoax,” Tony said. It turned out that a Latino student at Elon had written it. The student considered it satire. Now the assembled protesters gathered around Greg Williams, an organiser from the IWW. With long dark hair and a beard, he was calm and in control. He introduced the protesters to four men and women wearing bright green baseball caps. They were from the National Lawyers Guild, he said  —   if anyone got arrested, they would be available. He provided one of their phone numbers. It had a San Francisco area code. The activists passed around a black marker and wrote it on their arms. “Anyone with a smartphone that can be opened with your fingerprints should disable that function,” Megan said. If you’re arrested, she explained, police can’t make you give up your password, but they can compel you to use your fingerprint. The heads of the assembled protesters bent downward as they busily made adjustments to their phones. Finally, Williams instructed the protesters to “think about your positionality”. White protesters should, he said, try to keep at least two of them (white protesters) between the Klan and any protesters of colour. “Speak for yourself,” a black protester said, and there were laughs. “The bottom line,” Williams said, “is look after each other. ” A parking attendant had been making her way through, marking tires. The police would soon have reason to move the group, so everyone got in their cars and caravanned to the Pelham Community Center just across the highway. A sign out front promised a visit from Santa Claus later that week. Behind the community centre was a dirt road with a narrow stretch of grass running alongside it. The area was flanked by a high wire fence on one side and a dense forest on another. Everyone parked their cars, got out and waited. The protesters milled and talked and looked at each other’s placards. “RAPIST PRESIDENT” read one. “NO HATE IN OUR STATE” read another. A white man in shorts held a sign declaring that “The Worst Thing to Ever Come Out of a Vagina Was a WHITE MAN. ” Another white man  —   demonstrating every protest’s struggle to keep focus  —   had a sign pushing for a $15 minimum wage. Word was that the parade would happen at 11am. Now the black bloc got serious. Baseball bats were removed from car trunks. Masks were adjusted. One man wore a leather jacket covered with silver studs. Another put on a motorcycle helmet. The scene began to have the look of troops assembling before battle. More members of the media appeared. There were about a dozen small video crews and an equal number of journalists walking around with notebooks and tape recorders. They roamed among the assembled and waiting protesters, and, with nothing else to do, pretty much every journalist and photographer interviewed and photographed pretty much every protester. A trio of young activists with   signs were photographed at least 10 times in precisely the same pose. Sugelema took a picture, too. “What the hell,” she said. An SUV with tinted windows arrived. Two men emerged wearing identical outfits  —   fleece jackets, khaki pants, sunglasses and hats. Security contractors with a group called ESG, they were there to protect a TV newscaster, an older gentleman,   who emerged from the SUV with a cameraman in tow. His security detail followed. Two young men removed two crates from their car trunk, one full of bottled water, the other Red Bull, and distributed them. The mood was upbeat. “The current joke,” Megan said, “is that we’re just a bunch of goth kids playing Pokémon Go. ” With an hour to kill before the Klan parade, there was general anxiety that some faction of the protesters would start a drum circle. “The anarchists don’t like drum circles,” Megan noted. Sugelema pointed to a man with a red drum at his feet. Two other men were carrying cymbals. Another man with an elaborate moustache appeared with a saxophone. A few days before, at the Standing Rock protests, Sioux tribal leaders had asked the white people, arriving in great numbers and in festive spirit, not to treat the protests like Burning Man. Megan checked in with Natalie Janicello, the reporter who had the trust of the Loyal White Knights. Janicello happened to have been a student of Megan’s at Elon University. She conveyed the latest: the Loyal White Knights had pushed their parade back to 3pm. The theory circulated that the Klan had been scared off by the size of the   and had postponed their rally to gather a comparable volume of paraders of their own. One woman with hair dyed blue carried around a sign, newly made, that said “Big Bad KKK: 2 Scared 2 March”. Sugelema and I went to get snacks. At the local   where the staff and customers were all black, there was no awareness at all of the parade and   happening down the road. Next door, three young African American men were offering car washes. It was business as usual. We drove through Danville, quiet as a tomb. “They used to make socks here,” Sugelema noted. A wide river, the Dan, cut through the town, and there were abandoned factories decomposing alongside its grey water. Around this part of North Carolina, there had been textile factories specialising in hosiery. In 1951, two local manufacturers, the Riverside Cotton Mill and Schoolfield, merged and became the largest   textile mill in the world. But the plant closed in 2006. Now the city looked like the kind of place that might see its   warehouses turned into lofts, and its riverside factories transformed by  . But this kind of revival had yet to arrive in Danville. Sugelema’s parents were migrant farmworkers from Mexico. “We moved every couple months,” she said, following harvests up and down the Pacific coast. They picked apples in Washington and Oregon, melon and strawberries in California’s central valley. That’s where she was born, between harvests, and was given an unprecedented name. “It’s Estonian. In the hospital, my mom didn’t know what to name me, so the nurse suggested Sugelema,” making her name at birth Sugelema Guadalupe Gonzalez  —   probably the only person with that name the world has ever known. As an adult, Sugelema had looked up the meaning of her first name. According to the internet, in Estonian her name means “itchy”. Of the 17 students in her classroom this year, 14 are from immigrant families, most of them from Mexico. Since Trump’s election, some of the families were worried, fearing that he would follow through on promises to deport millions of people, but Sugelema had not rushed to judgment. Growing up, her parents had admired another Republican, Ronald Reagan. With the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Reagan had granted amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants, including many seasonal agricultural workers like her parents. “It was Reagan who allowed us stay in the US,” she said. Her parents found a small town in Oregon and settled down. Sugelema and her older brother were sent to a public school where most of the kids were white. Later, her brother joined the marines and became a successful IT specialist, with most of his contracts coming from the US military. He now lives in San Diego, where Sugelema’s mother is comfortably retired. Sugelema went to college and is the mother of five. Her oldest son is on the local football team. The American dream is not perfect, but it is real. Sugelema’s parents arrived in the 1970s from Mexico with nothing. They worked the fields, and now their daughter is a teacher and an    . This I learned on the drive. Later, Sugelema showed me one of the music videos she had made with her husband. The song was called All Things Considered, and the video has the manic energy and lurid colours of 1980s MTV. In it, Sugelema wears Tweety Bird pyjamas as a cast of costumed partygoers dances around her. Megan is dressed in lederhosen Tony wears the mask of a devil. In the centre of the frame, Sugelema sings, not quite awake and not quite asleep. We returned from the convenience store to find that the protesters had decided to have an impromptu march down the dirt road. The Caswell County sheriff had blocked off one entrance, so we went around to the other, parked, and arrived in time to see the march in full swing. The photographers dutifully took pictures and the videographers filmed. In every way it had the look of a real protest, and any   photo would imply a rousing demonstration in favour of equality and diversity. But there was no Klan and there were no spectators. It was about 60 activists marching for about 100ft on a road in the woods. After a few minutes, the group stopped marching and went back to waiting. It was not quite noon. Soon there was news. Apparently there was a group of white supremacists demonstrating in nearby Danville. Sugelema and I had just come back from there, and had seen nothing of the kind. “I think we should head out there!” Williams roared, and the crowd cheered. Someone started drumming. The saxophonist played a ditty as everyone ran to their cars. “Saxman, you’re my hero,” someone yelled. We followed the 30 cars back on to Highway 29. There was one catch: no one had an address. There had been some mention of “the centre of town”. Someone else had heard the word “Sutherlin”. Megan sleuthed that this might be the Sutherlin home in downtown Danville. During the waning days of the civil war, when Union troops had overrun and burned Richmond to the ground, the home of Major WT Sutherin in Danville had become the last capital of the Confederacy. For a week at least  —     April 1865. It was now a museum. We raced into Danville and were the first to find the building. It was a grand,   home in the Italian villa style, on a hilltop, with a wide lawn and a stone obelisk on which were engraved the words “Guarding Our Future by Preserving Our Past”. The property occupied an entire city block, and would have been a fitting site for any demonstration. But there was no one there. No white supremacists. No one at all. We drove through Danville and soon found the ESG Security SUV in a parking lot on the edge of Danville’s downtown. They’d found something. The   newscaster stood outside, flanked by his private security guards, talking to a tall man with a wild grey beard. He wore a black leather cowboy hat and a denim jacket bearing at least 10 Confederate flag patches. There were two trucks nearby. One bore the Virginia license plate CNFEDRT. The bearded man’s was named George Randall. He and the two women with him were bewildered, like Custer caught in an ambush. “We’re not part of the Klan,” Randall said. They were part of a group called the Virginia Flaggers, whose motto was “Heritage, not hate”. Periodically they held rallies to preserve Southern heritage and fly the Southern flag. He said he hadn’t heard anything about a Klan rally, and hated getting confused with the Klan. This kind of   he said, was the fault of the media. And the young people. And the liberals. He monologued for a time, at one point complaining about a woman he’d seen on the internet defecating on a picture of Trump. While he was speaking two more cars, carrying activists and journalists, pulled into the parking lot. Randall looked alarmed. “We better get out of here,” said one of the women in the CNFEDRT truck. Randall jumped in and they took off. Back at the Danville Museum of Fine Arts and History, a handful of   activists stood on the corner. Passing motorists, most of them African American, gawked and pointed. Thought experiment: what would the reaction have been in a reciprocal situation? If 30 or so young black people, most of them men, showed up in a small predominantly white town, wearing masks and carrying baseball bats, what might happen? Megan’s phone dinged. The activists were headed back to the rest stop where we had started the day almost five hours earlier. Sugelema and I left Danville and got on the highway. When we got to the rest stop, the 30 cars were leaving. They were going back to the Danville Museum. They’d heard that a different Confederate group was about to demonstrate. We tried to convince them that we had just come from Danville and that nothing was happening there, but it was too late. They were gone. We followed. It was a lot like high school, where dozens of cars roamed the same few suburban miles, looking for a party, stopping at the   getting a Slurpee, exchanging specious information and driving off  —   only to repeat the whole process half an hour later. We arrived at the museum to find a few disappointed   members. No Klan, no Confederates, no  . Megan and Tony arrived with news. Tony had seen some police cars a few blocks away, parked near a playground. He thought it might be the protest, or at least a protest. We raced to the park, but there were no Klansmen there, no black bloc. Instead, about 25 Danville residents, most of them African American, had assembled before a video camera, in rows, as if posing for a school picture. “Put down the guns!” they all said in unison. The gathering had nothing to do with white supremacists or Trump. It was about ending a recent cycle of violence in Danville. David L Wilson, who split his time between selling life insurance and working at a   plant, explained. “We’ve had a lot of shootings in our city. We’ve had 14 murders recently. Even last night, a young lady here had a gunshots outside of her house. ” He took the arm of an older man next to him he had tired eyes. “This was the idea of this man, Gerald Holmes,” Wilson said. Holmes had organised a movement called 434 Lives Matter, named for the local area code. “We have to change the mindset of the people,” Wilson said. “We can’t do it from a   position. We can’t do it just with the police. If we don’t change the mindset of the people in the community, and change the way they’re dealing with each other in terms of conflict resolution, we’re going to continue to see this robbing and shooting and killing. ” The members of 434 Lives Matter planned to go canvassing that day, door to door, in the neighbourhoods affected by the violence. For a moment, what the rest of us had been doing all day seemed hopelessly irrelevant. A mass of interlopers, many of whom were in costume, were chasing the Klan like it was some urban scavenger hunt. Meanwhile, the actual residents of the town were trying to figure out why their young men were shooting each other. “Sometimes they do things out of their character,” Wilson said. “But they’re doing what they think they have to do in order to survive. They’re trying to do what they can to make ends meet, to take care of their families. Our main thing is listening now. We have to listen to what people’s hurts are. ” We left the park. Megan’s phone went off again. The protesters were marching in downtown Danville. Apparently they were tired of waiting for the Klan. We raced to Main Street and found them. It was happening. And their numbers had grown  —   there were now about 100 people marching. There were more locals. There were parents with their children. It was loud and it was real. “No hate! No Fear! The KKK’s not welcome here!” they chanted. Leading the march were the black bloc, their baseball bats dragging on the pavement. Minutes before, I had felt like whatever the   activists were doing had no tangible meaning, but now, seeing it happen, it seemed vital and necessary. The last vestiges of the Ku Klux Klan must be met with this kind of demonstration of resistance. Trailing the marchers were three Danville police cars, their lights spinning brightly. They had sanctioned the march and were ensuring that it had the run of the road. All of which was remarkable. The police had allowed the protest on incredibly short notice, and were OK with dozens of   protesters marching down their street with bats. It was a model of accommodation and restraint. But because it was a Saturday, and because the stretch of road they marched was not a busy pedestrian thoroughfare, and because the march had been organized in the last   there were only a few people to watch it. A beautician peeked out the window of her shop, but otherwise the witnesses to the march were entirely members of the media. After a few blocks, the protesters gathered in a parking lot. Williams spoke first. “We shut shit down!” he said, and the crowd repeated it: “We shut shit down!” they roared. The mood was ebullient. “We shut shit down,” they roared again and again, their baseball bats hammering the pavement. Then, in the    style he had used earlier, Williams added a coda. “One more good piece of news before you go,” he said. “One more good piece of news before you go,” the crowd repeated. “We just heard from folks,” he said. “We just heard from folks,” the crowd repeated. “Who are watching the Twitter account,” he said. “Who are watching the Twitter account,” the crowd repeated. “Of the official spokesperson,” he said. “Of the official spokesperson,” the crowd repeated. “Of the Loyal White Knights,” he said. “Of the Loyal White Knights,” the crowd repeated. “Who says they fucking cancelled their march. ” “One more good piece of news before you go,” he said. “We just heard from folks who are watching the Twitter account of the official spokesperson of the Loyal White Knights  —   who says they fucking cancelled their march. ” The crowd erupted. Megan was ecstatic. The Klan, she and the activists had deduced, had been scared off by the strength of the  . Maybe the Loyal White Knights were really only two people  —   Amanda and Chris Barker. And maybe they had been trying to gather enough people all day to make their parade worthwhile, and had failed. It seemed like a suitably pathetic end to a hateful but powerless cabal. There was still the   and David Duke was running for office again, but at least the KKK, or this head of the serpent, was dead. Since the Loyal White Knights’ announcement of the rally, there had been much debate about what to do. There was a school of thought that said paying the Klan any attention at all was only encouraging them. There were those  —   elsewhere in North Carolina, from Greensboro to Raleigh to Charlotte  —   who preferred to hold   focusing on inclusion and featuring speakers and songs, far away from any confrontation. But the people in Danville believed it would be a terrible thing, in 2016, if a Klan rally happened, and happened uncontested. Slightly better would be a Klan rally that was vociferously confronted. Best of all, though, would be a Klan rally cancelled in the face of opposition. And this is what had just happened. And even though this was a modest   in a modest city, it mattered  —   just as Birmingham had mattered in 1963, and Ferguson had mattered in 2014. Maybe it mattered more because it was Danville, the last home of the Confederacy. Terrell Simmons was feeling good. A tall African American man wearing combat boots and a red bandana, he had led some of the   chants. “The Klan don’t have the people, so they don’t have the power!” he had yelled. “The establishment don’t have the people, so they don’t have the power!” He was a high school   teacher from Mobile, Alabama, and had driven 12 hours to confront the Klan. Now he was basking in the victory and planning what would come next. “We’re going to have a lot of cohesion between the groups that have been divided,” he said. “We’re going to see that we can’t build this country without one another. A lot of the things that have held us up in the past are going to go away. Reality is going to set in that without actually meeting the needs of the poor people, the sick people, this nation is doomed to fail. ” He walked away smiling, joining the black bloc, whose members were taking off their masks and disbanding. Soon there were only a few people left on Main Street. Tony and Sugelema were looking for a place to get a beer. “Shit,” Megan said. In the parking lot, now nearly empty, she was reading her phone. Natalie Janicello had just posted a tweet. “IT’S HAPPENING,” she wrote. “KKK just came through Roxboro. Battle flags and shouting WHITE POWER. ” While the   protesters marched through Danville, the Klan had paraded through a different town, 45 minutes away. Janicello had embedded film of it into her Twitter feed. In the video, about 20 vehicles speed through an intersection. Some of the cars have Confederate flags flapping from their windows. Some cars are unadorned  —   just gray sedans driving down the street. No spectators are visible. None of the drivers are visible. A woman in one of the cars yells “White power” from a window. Then it’s over. Megan was despondent. Not just because the Klan had trolled the protesters and had pulled off their parade. But there was the matter of her former student, Natalie Janicello, who must have known about the location of the parade, and had opted not to tell any of the protesters or members of the media. She was the only media member, and maybe the only person, who saw it. The next day brought one last twist. A Klan member named Richard Dillon, who had made the trip from Indiana, was in the hospital with multiple stab wounds to the chest. Two other Klansmen, Chris Barker and William Ernest Hagen of California, were charged with the crime. Apparently, in the early morning before the planned parade, the Klan had assembled at the Barker’s house. Drinks were drunk. Dillon had hassled Hagen about a Klan rally Hagen had put on in Orange County, where the Klansmen had been beaten up by  . Hagen didn’t much appreciate that, so he stabbed Dillon repeatedly, while Barker blocked the door. Bleeding profusely, Dillon managed to escape, drove to Danville, went to the hospital and told the doctors on duty what had happened. Police arrested Barker and Hagen that morning. So they didn’t get to see the parade, either. • This article was amended on 20 December 2016 to correct the name of the Industrial Workers of the World."
"There he is, seated on his wooden front porch overlooking a trim yard in suburban DeRidder, Louisiana, watching for my car. He rises from his chair, waving with one arm and steadying himself on his walker with the other. A   6ft 3in man with a grey crewcut and blue eyes, Lee Sherman, age 82, gives me a welcoming smile. A player for the Dallas Texans football team (later renamed the Kansas City Chiefs) for two years, an honoree in Who’s Who of American Motorsports, a Nascar racer who drove at 200 miles an hour in a neck brace and fire suit, and the proud purchaser of a waterski boat once owned by TV’s Wonder Woman, he shakes my hand, apologising, “I’m sorry to be on this thing,” he points to his walker, “and not take you through the house properly. ” He doesn’t feel like his old self, he says, but accepts his feeble legs  . Given his dangerous work at the petrochemical company, Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) he is happy to be alive. “All my   from back then are dead most died young,” he tells me. As a young man, Sherman trained as a coppersmith in the US naval shipyards outside Seattle, where his dad worked as an electrician. When travelling south for work in 1965, he was hired by PPG as a maintenance pipefitter and soon earned a reputation as a mechanical genius. He was fearless and careful, a good fit for his hazardous job fitting and repairing pipes carrying lethal chemicals such as ethylene dichloride, mercury, lead, chromium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dioxins. At one point, Sherman narrowly escaped death, he tells me, taking a careful, long sip of coffee. One day while he was working, cold chlorine was accidentally exposed to extreme heat, which instantly transformed the liquid to gas. Sixteen workers were in the plant at the time. Noting that the company was short of protective gear, Sherman’s boss instructed him to leave. “Thirty minutes after I left,” he says, “the plant blew up. Five of the 15 men I left behind were killed. ” The next afternoon, Sherman’s boss asked him to help search for the bodies of the dead workers. Two were found, three were not. Acid had so decomposed the body of one of the three victims that his remains came out in pieces in the sewer that drained into a nearby bayou. “If someone hadn’t found him,” Sherman says, turning his head to look out of his dining room window, “that body would have ended up floating into Bayou d’Inde. ”  Membership Event: The Long Read live   at the Hospital Club  In the 1960s, safety was at a minimum at PPG. “During safety meetings,” Sherman tells me, “the supervisor just gave us paperwork to fill out. Working with the chemicals, we wore no protective facial masks. You learned how to hold your nose and breathe through your mouth. “The company didn’t much warn us about dangers,” he says, adding in a softer voice, “My   did. They’d say, ‘You can’t stand in that stuff. Get out of it.’ I wouldn’t be alive today, if it weren’t for my  . ” The pipes Sherman worked on carried oxygen, hydrogen, and chlorine, and when a pipe sprung a leak, he explains, “I was the guy to fix it. ” “Did you use your bare hands?” I ask. “Oh, yeah, yeah. ” Eventually the general foreman issued badges to the workers to record any overexposure to dangerous chemicals, Sherman says, “but the foreman made fun of them. It’s supposed to take two or three months before the gauge registers you’ve reached the limit. My badge did in three days. The foreman thought I’d stuck it inside a pipe!” Accidents happened. One day, Sherman was standing in a room, leaning over a large pipe to check a filter, when an operator in a distant control room mistakenly turned a knob, sending hot,   liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons coursing through the pipe, drenching him. “It was hot and I got completely soaked,” Sherman tells me. “I jumped into the safety shower and had the respirator in my mouth, so I wasn’t overcome. But the chemical was burning pretty bad. It really gets you worst underneath your arms, in between your legs, up your bottom. ” Despite the shower, he said, “The chemical ate off my shoes. It ate off my pants. It ate my shirt. My undershorts were gone. Only some elastic from my socks and my undershorts remained. It burned my clothes clean off me. ” As a result of the things he suffered, saw, and was ordered to do as a pipefitter in the petrochemical plant, Sherman became an ardent environmentalist. Calcasieu Parish, in which he worked for 15 years at PPG, is among the 2% of American counties with the highest toxic emissions per capita. According to the American Cancer Society, Louisiana has the   incidence of cancer for men and the   male death rate from cancer in the nation. But Sherman has recently volunteered to post lawn signs for the Tea Party congressman John Fleming, who favours cutting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weakening the Clean Air Act, and oil drilling on the outer continental shelf of the US, as well as opposing the regulation of greenhouse gases and backing less regulation of Wall Street. Sherman is a regular at meetings of the DeRidder Tea Party, wearing his red, white and blue party   which features an eagle sharpening its talons. So why was Sherman the environmentalist eager to plant lawn signs for a politician calling for cuts in the EPA? If I could answer this question, maybe I could unlock the door to what I came to call the Great Paradox.  I had begun my   journey to the heart of the American right carrying with me, as if it were a backpack, a great paradox. Back in 2004, there was a paradox underlying the right —  left split. Since then the split has become a gulf. Across the country, conservative “red states” are poorer and have more teenage mothers, more divorce, worse health, more obesity, more   deaths, more    babies, and lower school enrolment. On average, people in red states die five years earlier than people in liberal “blue states”. Indeed, the gap in life expectancy between Louisiana (75. 7) and Connecticut (80. 8) is the same as that between Nicaragua and the United States. Red states suffer more in another important but   way, one that speaks to the very biological   in health and life: industrial pollution. The right now calls for cuts in entire segments of the federal government  —   the Departments of Education, Energy, Commerce, and Interior, for example. In January 2015, 58 Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, which is responsible for the collection of taxes. Some Republican congressional candidates call for abolishing all state schools. In March 2015, the   Senate voted 51 to 49 in support of an amendment to a budget resolution to sell or give away all   federal lands other than national monuments and national parks. This would include forests, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. Joined by 95 Republican congressmen, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, one of the most polluted states in the union, has called for the end of the EPA. The Tea Party’s turn away from government may signal a broader trend. During the depression of the 1930s, Americans turned to the federal government for aid in their economic recovery. But in response to the great recession of 2008, the majority turned away from it. As the political divide widens and opinions harden, the stakes have grown vastly higher. Neither ordinary citizens nor leaders are talking much “across the aisle” damaging the surprisingly delicate process of governance itself. The United States has been divided before, of course. During the civil war, a difference in belief led to some 750, 000 deaths. During the stormy 1960s, too, clashes arose over the war in Vietnam, civil rights, and women’s rights. But in the end, a healthy democracy depends on a collective capacity to hash things out. And to get there, we need to figure out what’s going on  —   especially on the rapidly shifting and   right. Lee Sherman’s work at PPG was a source of personal pride, but he clearly did not feel particularly loyal to the company. Still, he did as he was told. And one day in the late 1960s, after his acid bath, he was told to take on another ominous job. It was to be done twice a day, usually after dusk, and always in secret. In order to do this job, Sherman had to wield an   “tar buggy” propelled forwards on four wheels. Loaded on this buggy was an enormous steel tank that held “heavy bottoms”  —   the highly viscous tar residue of chlorinated hydrocarbon that had sunk to the bottom of   steel vessels. A layer of asbestos surrounded the tank, to retain heat generated by a heater beneath the buggy. Copper coils were wound around its base. The hotter the tar, the less likely it was to solidify before it was dumped. Working overtime in the evenings, under cover of dark, his respirator on, Sherman would tow the tar buggy down a path that led towards the Calcasieu Ship Channel in one direction and towards Bayou d’Inde in another. Sherman would look around “to make sure no one saw me” and check if the wind was blowing away from him, so as to avoid fumes blowing into his face. He backed the tar buggy up to the marsh. Then, he said, “I’d bend down and open the faucet. ” Under the pressure of compressed air, the toxins would spurt out “20 or 30 feet” into the marsh. Sherman waited until the buggy was drained of the illegal toxic waste. “No one ever saw me,” he says. Sherman lingers over an event that occurred one day while he was alone on the bank with his secret. “While I was dumping the heavy bottoms in the canal, I saw a bird fly into the fumes and fall instantly into the water. It was like he’d been shot. I put two shovels out into the mud, so I could walk on them into the marsh without sinking too far down. I walked out and picked up the bird. Its wings and body didn’t move. It looked dead, but its heart was still beating. I grew up on a farm, and I know about birds. I walked back on the shovels to the bank with the bird. I held its head in my right hand and its wings and body in my left hand. “I blew into its beak and worked it up and down. Then it started breathing again. Its eyes opened. But the rest of its body still didn’t move. I put it on the hood of my truck, which was warm. Then I left the bird to go check my tar buggy. But when I got back, the bird was gone. It had flown away. So that was one thing good. ” During the afternoon, Sherman circles back to the story of the bird, alternating between it and the story of the tar buggy. “I knew what I did was wrong,” he repeats. “Toxins are a killer. And I’m very sorry I did it. My mama would not have wanted me to do it. I never told anybody this before, but I knew how not to get caught. ” It was as if Sherman had performed the company’s crime and assumed the company’s guilt as his own. But, like the bird, Sherman himself became a victim. He grew ill from his exposure to the chemicals. After his hydrocarbon burn, “My feet felt like clubs, and I couldn’t bend my legs and rise up, so the company doctor ordered me put on medical leave. I kept visiting the company doctor to see if I was ready to come back, but he kept saying I shouldn’t come back until I could do a deep knee bend. ” Sherman took a medical leave of eight months and then returned to work. But not for long. In 1980, after 15 years of working at PPG, Sherman was summoned and found himself facing a   termination committee. “They didn’t want to pay my medical disability,” he explains. “So they fired me for absenteeism. They said I hadn’t worked enough hours! They didn’t count my overtime. They didn’t discount time I took off for my Army Reserve duty. So that’s what I got fired for  —   absenteeism. They handed me my pink slip. Two security guards escorted me to the parking lot. ” Sherman slaps the table as if, decades later, he has just got fired again. Seven years later, Sherman would meet a member of that termination committee once again. There had been an enormous fish kill in Bayou d’Inde, downstream from the spot where Sherman had dumped the toxic waste and rescued the overcome bird. A Calcasieu Advisory Task Force met to discuss the surrounding waterways, to describe them as “impaired” and to consider issuing a seafood advisory, warning people to limit their consumption of local fish. Local waterways had long been contaminated from many sources. But in 1987, the state finally issued a seafood advisory for Bayou d’Inde, the Calcasieu Ship Channel, and the estuary to the Gulf of Mexico. The warning was shocking, the first in memory, and it called for limits “due to low levels of chemical contamination”. No more than two meals with locally caught fish a month, it said. No swimming, water sports, or contact with bottom sediments. It was a very belated attempt by the state of Louisiana to warn the public of toxins in its waters. Instantly fishermen became alarmed. Would they be able to sell their fish? Would residents limit what they ate? Were people now being asked to look at fish, not with relish for a scrumptious gumbo, jambalaya, or     fish fry, but as dubious carriers of toxic chemicals? The carefully cultivated notion of harmony between oil and fishing  —   all this was thrown into question, and not just in Louisiana.   of all seafood consumed across the US came from the Gulf of Mexico, and   of that from Louisiana itself. Many livelihoods were at stake. By 1987, several things had transpired that would affect the fishermen’s response to the edict. For one thing, PPG was not alone. Other industries had been polluting so much that Louisiana had become the worst hazardous waste producer in the nation. For another thing, the US Congress had established the Environmental Protection Agency (1970) the Clean Air Act (1970) and the Clean Water Act (1972). In addition, many small grassroots environmental groups had sprung up throughout the state, led by homemakers, teachers, farmers, and others who were appalled to discover toxic waste being dumped in their backyard, illness, and disease. Around the time of the advisory, local activists were rising up against toxic dumping around Lake Charles and elsewhere, as part of the “ ”  —   or “ ”  —   politics of the 1970s and 1980s. But most of those local activists are now Tea Party Republicans and, like Lee Sherman himself, are averse to an overbearing federal government, and even to much of the EPA. There it was: the Great Paradox. In the meantime, the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services posted warning signs about fishing and swimming, which were promptly riddled with bullets or stolen. Burton Coliseum, the largest public meeting place in Lake Charles at the time, was filled “with about a thousand angry fishermen and others in the fish industry”. Sherman continues, “When the meeting was called to order, it was standing room only. I could hear murmuring in the crowd. Oh, they were ready to kill the government. ” A row of company officials, including two from PPG, company lawyers, and state officials, all sat behind a table on a stage in front of the crowd. A state official stood to explain the reason for the seafood advisory: the fish had been contaminated. Citizens had to be informed. What had caused it? The officials from PPG seated on the stage feigned ignorance. The meeting went on for 20 or 30 minutes, with catcalls to the government officials rising from the crowd. Then, to everyone’s astonishment, uninvited, Lee Sherman  —   long since fired by PPG  —   climbed on stage. With his back to the officials, he faced the angry fishermen, lifted a large cardboard sign, and slowly walked from one side of the stage to the other, so all could read it: “I’M THE ONE WHO DUMPED IT IN THE BAYOU. ” The entire coliseum went silent. Officials tried to get Sherman to leave the stage. But a fisherman called out, “We want to hear him. ” “I talked for 36 minutes,” Sherman recalls. “I told them I had followed my boss’s orders. I told them the chemicals had made me sick. I told them I’d been fired for absenteeism. “The only thing I didn’t tell them was that sitting behind the front table on stage was a member of the PPG termination committee that had fired me. That was the best part  —   the PPG guys had both hands over the backs of their heads. ” Now the fishermen knew the fish were truly contaminated. Soon after the meeting, they filed a civil lawsuit against PPG and won an    settlement that gave a mere $12, 000 to each fisherman. Sherman had worked hard, unpleasant, dangerous jobs. He had loyally followed company orders to contaminate an estuary. He had done his company’s moral dirty work, taken its guilt as his own, and then been betrayed and discarded, like a form of waste. The most heroic act of Lee Sherman’s life had been to reveal to the world a company’s dirty secret, and to tell a thousand fishermen furious at the government that companies like PPG were to blame. Yet over the course of his lifetime, Sherman had moved from the left to the right. When he lived as a young man in Washington State, he said proudly, “I ran the campaign of the first woman to run for Congress in the state. ” But when he moved from Seattle to Dallas for work in the 1950s, he shifted from conservative Democrat to Republican, and after 2009, to the Tea Party. So while his central life experience had been betrayal at the hands of industry, he now felt  —   as his politics reflected  —   most betrayed by the federal government. He believed that PPG and many other local petrochemical companies at the time had done wrong, and that cleaning the mess up was right. He thought industry would not “do the right thing” by itself. But still he rejected the federal government. Indeed, Sherman embraced candidates who wanted to remove nearly all the guardrails on industry and cut the EPA. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had vastly improved life for workmen such as Sherman  —   and he appreciated those reforms  —   but he felt the job was largely done. In the life of one man, Lee Sherman, I saw reflected both sides of the Great Paradox  —   the need for help and a principled refusal of it. As a victim of toxic exposure himself, a participant in polluting public waters, now proudly declaring himself as an environmentalist, why was he throwing in his lot with the   Tea Party? Not because anyone was paying him to, at least directly. Sherman was putting up Tea Party lawn signs for free. His source of news was limited to Fox News and videos and blogs exchanged by rightwing friends, which placed him in an echo chamber of doubt about the EPA, the federal government, the president, and taxes. When Americans moved in the past, they left their homes in search of better jobs, cheaper housing, or milder weather. But, according to Bill Bishop and Robert G Cushing’s book, The Big Sort, when people move today, it is more often to live near others who share their views. People are segregating themselves into different emotionally toned enclaves  —   anger here, hopefulness and trust there. And the more people who confine themselves to   company, the more extreme their views become. According to a 2014 Pew study of more than 10, 000 Americans, the most politically engaged on each side see those in the “other party” not just as wrong, but as “so misguided that they threaten the nation’s wellbeing”. Compared with the past, each side also increasingly gets its news from its own television channel  —   the right from Fox News, the left from MSNBC. And so the divide widens. As I reviewed the social terrain of the   people I had come to know  —   the companies, the state government, the church, Fox News  —   I reflected on the paradox. Everyone I was talking to was enduring a great deal of pollution and despite the silence from companies, politicians and state officials, nearly everyone clearly knew it. To some, such as Lee Sherman, exposure had become the defining experience of their lives. To others, it was a passing matter. While many spoke of their love of capitalism, the dominant industry in their economy presented a decidedly mixed story. Oil was highly automated and accounted for some 15% of jobs  —   and even some of those were going to foreign workers at lower pay. The state had made huge cuts to local jobs and social services in order to bring in companies and, instead of money trickling down, a substantial amount was leaking out. To some degree, the community had become the site of local production without being the site of local producers.  Behind all I was learning about bayou and factory childhoods and the larger context  —   industry, state, church, regular media, Fox News  —   of the lives of those I had come to know lay, I realised, a deep story. A deep story is a story that feels as if it were true. It removes judgment. It removes fact. It tells us how things feel. Such a story permits those on both sides of the political spectrum to stand back and explore the subjective prism through which the party on the other side sees the world. And I do not believe that we understand anyone’s politics, right or left, without it. For we all have a deep story. The deep story here focuses on relationships between social groups within the national borders of the United States. I constructed this deep story to represent  —   in metaphorical form  —   the hopes, fears, pride, shame, resentment and anxiety in the lives of those I talked with. You are patiently standing in a long line leading up a hill, as in a pilgrimage. You are situated in the middle of this line, along with others who are also white, older, Christian, and predominantly male, some with college degrees, some not. Just over the brow of the hill is the American dream, the goal of everyone waiting in line. Many at the back of the line are people of colour  —   poor, young and old, mainly without college degrees. It is scary to look back  —   there are so many behind you, and in principle you wish them well. Still, you have waited a long time, worked hard, and the line is barely moving. You deserve to move forward a little faster. You are patient but weary. You focus ahead, especially on those at the very top of the hill. The American dream is a dream of progress  —   the idea that you are better off than your forebears, just as they superseded their parents  —   and it extends beyond money and stuff. You have suffered long hours, layoffs, and exposure to dangerous chemicals at work, and received reduced pensions. You have shown moral character through trial by fire, and the American dream of prosperity and security is a reward for all of this, showing who you have been and are  —   a badge of honour. The sun is hot and the line unmoving. In fact, is it moving backwards? You have not had a raise in years, and there is no talk of one. Actually, if you are short a high school diploma, or even a BA, your income has dropped over the last 20 years. You have taken the bad news in stride because you are a positive person. You are not a complainer. You count your blessings. You wish you could help your family and church more, because that is where your heart is. You would like them to feel grateful to you for being so giving to them. But this line is not moving. And after all your intense effort, all your sacrifice, you are beginning to feel stuck. Look! You see people cutting in line ahead of you! You are following the rules. They are not. As they cut in, it feels like you are being moved back. How can they just do that? Who are they? Some are black. Through affirmative action plans, pushed by the federal government, they are being given preference for places in colleges and universities, apprenticeships, jobs, welfare payments, and free lunches. Women, immigrants, refugees,   workers  —   where will it end? Your money is running through a liberal sympathy sieve you do not control or agree with. These are opportunities you would have loved to have had in your day  —   and either you should have had them when you were young or the young shouldn’t be getting them now. It’s not fair. Then you become suspicious. If people are cutting in line ahead of you, someone must be helping them. Who? A man is monitoring the line, walking up and down it, ensuring that the line is orderly and that access to the dream is fair. His name is President Barack Hussein Obama. But  —   hey  —   you see him waving to the line cutters. He feels extra sympathy for them that he does not feel for you. He’s on their side. You can certainly be proud of being American. And anyone who criticises America  —   well, they are criticising you. If you can no longer feel pride in the United States through its president, you’ll have to feel American in some new way  —   by banding with others who feel as you do  —   strangers in their own land. I return to my new Louisiana friends and acquaintances to find out whether the deep story resonates with them. When I relate it to Lee Sherman, he tells me, “You’ve read my mind. ” Feeling betrayed by the federal government and turning wholeheartedly to the free market, the right finds it hard to see the realities that confront them. Giant companies have grown vastly larger, more automated, more global, and more powerful. For them, productivity is increasingly based on cheap labour in plants abroad, cheap imported labour at home, and automation, and less on American labour. The more powerful they have become, the less resistance they have encountered from unions and government. Thus, they have felt more free to allocate more profits to top executives and stockholders, and less to workers. But it is very hard to criticise an ally, and the right sees the free market as its ally against the powerful alliance of the federal government and the takers. Even Sherman, who had greatly suffered at the hands of Pittsburg Plate Glass, owned stock in it and exclaimed proudly to me, when I asked him how he felt about getting fired, “I was pissed and stunned but, hey, I didn’t lose everything. I had $5, 000 in stocks!” In the undeclared class war, expressed through the weary and ultimately enraging wait for the American dream, those I came to know developed a visceral hate for the ally of the “enemy” cutters in line  —   the federal government. They hated other people for needing it. They rejected their own need of it  —   even to help clean up the pollution in their backyard. Normally when doing field research, a sociologist comes to a scene, then leaves it, and the scene itself remains unchanged. By my 10th visit with my core of white,   and older, Christian, married,   and   Louisianans, I had discovered that virtually everyone I talked to embraced the same “  ” deep story. But by the end of my research, there had been a profound change. I checked in with my new friends and acquaintances to see how they felt about Donald Trump. Looking back at my previous research, I see that the scene had been set for Trump’s rise, like kindling before a match is lit. Three elements had come together. Since 1980, virtually all those I talked with felt on shaky economic ground, a fact that made them brace at the very idea of “redistribution”. They also felt culturally marginalised: their views about abortion, gay marriage, gender roles, race, guns, and the Confederate flag all were held up to ridicule in the national media. They had begun to feel like a besieged minority. And to these feelings they added the cultural tendency to identify “up” the social ladder with the planter, the oil magnate, and to feel detached from those further down the ladder. Trump is an “emotions candidate”. More than any other presidential candidate in decades, Trump focuses on eliciting and praising emotional responses from his fans rather than on detailed policy prescriptions. His speeches  —   evoking dominance, bravado, clarity, national pride, and personal uplift  —   inspire an emotional transformation. Then he points to that transformation. Not only does Trump evoke emotion, he makes an object of it, presenting it back to his fans as a sign of collective success. His supporters have been in mourning for a lost way of life. Many have become discouraged, others depressed. They yearn to feel pride but instead have felt shame. Their land no longer feels like their own. Joined together with others like themselves, they feel greatly elated at Trump’s promise to deliver them unto a state in which they are no longer strangers in their own land.

"In April 2002,   Le Pen stunned all of Europe by defeating the socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, in the first round of the French presidential election, and advancing to the final round between the top two candidates. Terrified by the prospect of a   victory, the French left  —   including communists, Greens and the Socialist party  —   threw their support behind the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac, a pillar of the   establishment who had served as mayor of Paris for 18 years before becoming president in 1995. This electoral strategy effectively isolated Le Pen’s Front National (FN) depicting it as a cancerous force in the French body politic. Two weeks later, on 5 May, Chirac won the election with an astronomical 82% of the vote, trouncing Le Pen by the biggest margin in a French presidential election since 1848. Raucous celebrations spilled into the streets of Paris. “We have gone through a time of serious anxiety for the country  —   but tonight France has reaffirmed its attachment to the values of the republic,” Chirac declared in his victory speech. Then, speaking to the joyous crowds in the Place de la République, he lauded them for rejecting “intolerance and demagoguery”. But May 2002 was not, in fact, a moment of triumph. Rather it was the dying gasp of an old order, in which the fate of European nations was controlled by large establishment parties.   Le Pen was an easy target for the left, and for establishment figures such as Chirac. He was a political provocateur who appealed as much to antisemites and homophobes as to voters upset about immigration, drawing his support largely from the most reactionary elements of the old Catholic right. In other words, he was a familiar villain  —   and his ideology represented an archaic France, a defeated past. Moreover, he did not seriously aim for power, and never really came close to acquiring it his role was to be a   and to inject his ideas into the national debate. Europe’s new far right is different. From Denmark to the Netherlands to Germany, a new wave of rightwing parties has emerged over the past     and they are casting a much wider net than   Le Pen ever attempted to. And by deftly appealing to fear, nostalgia and resentment of elites, they are rapidly broadening their base. Le Pen’s own daughter is a prime example of the new ambitions of the right: unlike her incendiary father, Marine Le Pen is running a disciplined political operation and has already proven that her party can win upwards of 40% of the vote in regions from Calais in the north to the Côte d’Azur in the south. She and her Danish and Dutch counterparts are not  —   as some on the left would like to believe  —     or inconsequential extremists with fringe ideas lacking popular appeal. These parties have built a coherent ideology and steadily chipped away at the establishment parties’ hold on power by pursuing a new and devastatingly effective electoral strategy. They have made a very public break with the symbols of the old right’s past, distancing themselves from skinheads,   and homophobes. They have also deftly   the causes, policies and rhetoric of their opponents. They have sought to outflank the left when it comes to defending a strong welfare state and protecting social benefits that they claim are threatened by an influx of freeloading migrants. They have effectively claimed the progressive causes of the left  —   from gay rights to women’s equality and protecting Jews from antisemitism  —   as their own, by depicting Muslim immigrants as the primary threat to all three groups. As fear of Islam has spread, with their encouragement, they have presented themselves as the only true defenders of western identity and western liberties  —   the last bulwark protecting a besieged   civilisation from the barbarians at the gates. These parties have steadily filled an electoral vacuum left open by social democratic and   parties, who ignored voters’ growing anger over immigration  —   some of it legitimate, some of it bigoted  —   or simply waited too long to address it. They have shed some of the right’s most unsavoury baggage while responding to both economic anxiety and fear of terrorism by blending a nativist economic policy  —   more welfare, but only for us  —   and tough   and border security measures. Their message is beginning to resonate widely with a fearful population that believes the liberal governing elite no longer listens to them.  Brexit was just the start. Europe’s new far right is poised to transform the continent’s political landscape  —   either by winning elections or simply by pulling a besieged political centre so far in its direction that its ideas become the new normal. And when that happens, groups that would never have contemplated voting for a   party 10 years ago  —   the young, gay people, Jews, feminists  —   may join the   voters who have already abandoned parties of the left to become the new backbone of the populist right. On 6 May 2002, one day after revellers filled the streets of Paris to celebrate Chirac’s historic victory, the flamboyant and iconoclastic leader of the Dutch far right, Pim Fortuyn, was gunned down by a radical animal rights activist as he emerged from a radio interview. His assassin later claimed that he had killed Fortuyn to stop him from using Muslims as “scapegoats”. In national elections nine days later, Fortuyn’s eponymous party  —   the Pim Fortuyn List  —   became the second largest in the Netherlands with 17% of the vote. Fortuyn, a former communist and openly gay man who boasted of sleeping with Muslim immigrants while calling for a ban on Muslim immigration, was an electrifying figure in a country known for its staid politics. His time in the limelight was short but transformative. It was Fortuyn who blazed the trail for the new generation of   leaders across Europe. He may not have intended to be a pioneer, but his brand of   political incorrectness and his depiction of Islamic culture as a “backwards” and reactionary threat to the   progressive values of western Europe would provide a potent template for a modernised far right. His ideological inheritors in Dutch politics, as well as the revamped Front National in France, the Danish People’s Party and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland have all emulated Fortuyn in their own ways. Fortuyn proved that the winning argument for the European far right was not a   appeal to conservative religious values, but rather to claim it was “defending secular, progressive culture from the threat of immigration,” argues Merijn Oudenampsen of Tilburg University. The Netherlands was a perfect laboratory for this new strategy because, unlike France, it did not have a strong contingent of religious traditionalists opposed to women’s liberation and gay rights. Before founding his own party in 2002, Fortuyn had tried to join an establishment   party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the late 1990s. The party’s   Frits Bolkestein, who had been one of the first figures to speak critically about immigration in the early 1990s, remembers Fortuyn as a talented but inflammatory politician. “He had a thoroughly theatrical personality, and that played in his favour,” said Bolkestein, now in his 80s, from his office overlooking the canals of Amsterdam. “I didn’t want him to be in my parliamentary group, so I   him   …     He would have acted as a fragmentation bomb. ” Fortuyn took his explosive rhetoric elsewhere and, by creating a new type of   politics in progressive garb  —   “a form of xenophobia ideally suited to a nation that prides itself on its tolerance,” as a New Yorker profile once described it  —   he redirected the entire national debate in a way that has endured long after his death. Two years after Fortuyn was killed, the Netherlands was traumatised by another political assassination. Early one morning in November 2004, the filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered by a young   Mohammed Bouyeri, who shot van Gogh eight times, slashed his throat and then pinned a letter to his chest with a knife. The letter was a death threat aimed at the   Dutch parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali  —   a vocal critic of Islam who was soon placed under the protection of the Dutch security services. The two assassinations shook the Netherlands to its core and catapulted a   and theatrically coiffed politician, Geert Wilders, to popularity as an ideological successor to Fortuyn. Wilders had also flirted with Bolkestein’s VVD, beginning his political career as a staffer in the party office. In late 2004, he split off and formed his own. With Hirsi Ali in hiding, he quickly became the most prominent   voice in the country  —   and has remained so ever since. For those who cared to look, the political ground had already begun to shift. Six months before Chirac’s trouncing of Le Pen and Fortuyn’s assassination, Denmark had an election. On its surface the result was not a historical watershed the   Venstre party ousted the Social Democrats, handing power from one establishment party to the other. What had changed was that the Danish People’s Party, which had campaigned on an overtly   platform, took 12% of the vote  —   transforming it into a kingmaker in parliament. Unlike France, which revelled in its triumph over the FN, or the Netherlands, where the remains of Fortuyn’s party failed to become a real parliamentary force, the DPP immediately became a serious player with real influence over policy. And it was not only taking votes from the right it was also attracting disgruntled social democratic voters who felt that their leaders had abandoned them. The DPP had crafted a social and economic policy that was in many ways more socialist than that of the Social Democrats  —   promising better health care, better care for the elderly, and more subsidised housing. As the outgoing Social Democratic prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen told me in 2002, a few months after his defeat: “They took a part of our rhetoric and tried to sell it as a new package to the people, and with some success, one may say. ” Back then, Naser Khader, a Danish member of parliament who immigrated from Syria as a child, argued that “the best way to weaken the DPP is to give them influence”. He was wrong. The headquarters of the Front National sits on a quiet street in the unassuming Paris suburb of Nanterre, near a car repair shop and a Portuguese restaurant. Only when you approach the grey building with its mostly closed blue shutters do the armed guards come into view. In her modest   office, surrounded by books and a cloud of vape smoke, Marine Le Pen explained earlier this year how she transformed a party previously known for calling the Holocaust a “detail of history” into a genuine contender for the presidency. “Voluntarily or not, he gave ammunition to our adversaries,” Le Pen said of her father. But she insisted that she has now cleaned house. “I fired them all   …     all those people who expressed an ideology or held views that I found unacceptable. ” Julien Rochedy, a    who headed the FN’s youth wing but has since left the party, told me that he believes the changes are real. Whereas the party’s former leader used to pepper his speeches with lines that made Jews’ hair stand on end, today, if someone tells a racist joke within the party, “you will be attacked straight away,” Rochedy said. “There is such   these days. They are so afraid they’ll be accused once again of being antisemitic or racist. ” Still, the party’s detractors continue to level the same charges at the FN, which outrages Marine Le Pen. “Today our adversaries no longer have that ammunition, and they repeat on loop” old tropes about fascists and racists. “At a certain point this argument loses its force,” she continued, “because voters see clearly that there’s absolutely nothing in our platform that remotely resembles fascism or racism. ” Le Pen has done more than kick out the most blatant racists and antisemites. She has consciously crafted a campaign designed to appeal to voters of the centre and left  —   and other constituencies  —   who could never have imagined voting for her father’s Front National. As Le Monde’s Olivier Faye has written, she is “trying to erase another image that has stuck to the skin of the FN  —   that of homophobia”. And it is working: a survey showed that her share of the vote among married gay couples in the 2015 regional elections was over 32%  —   up from just 19% in a similar poll from 2012. As Le Pen has filled her inner circle with more and more openly gay advisers and party leaders, she has also made her pitch to Jewish voters more explicit: “For a lot of French Jews, the FN appears to be the only movement that can defend them from this new antisemitism nourished in the banlieues,” Le Pen told me. “In a very natural way they have turned toward the FN, because the FN is capable, I think, of protecting them from that. ” Among French voters threatened by the country’s new diversity, rejection of a multicultural society increasingly takes the form of longing for a bygone era. And peddling nostalgia is the centrepiece of many new   parties across Europe. In France, Marine Le Pen has promised a return to a time when the French had their own currency and monetary policy, when there were fewer mosques and less halal meat, when no one complained about nativity scenes in public buildings, and when French schools promoted a republican ethos of assimilation. “A growing number of French people feel uncomfortable in their own country,” the prominent philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut, declared in January during a debate with the   presidential candidate Alain Juppé  —   who has taken a less strident line on Islam and migration than his rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Finkielkraut depicted contemporary France as a country of halal butchers and tea shops filled only with men, pleading that “the public good isn’t in the clouds, it’s made from tangible things  —   the French of Proust and Montaigne   …     the Jardin du Luxembourg and the cows of Normandy”. Finkielkraut, a    Jewish liberal, is not an admirer of the Front National, but Marine Le Pen’s deliberate appeals to Jews and gay people have given political expression to an argument that he first made more than a decade ago  —   that the left, with its indulgence of Islam, poses a greater threat to France than the far right. After Chirac “saved” the republic from   Le Pen in 2002, Finkielkraut watched the celebrations in the streets and warned that the victors were the real danger: “The future of hate is in their camp and not in the camp of those nostalgic for Vichy,” he wrote, “   …     in the camp of the multicultural society and not that of the ethnic nation  —   in the camp of respect, not that of rejection. ” Fourteen years later, after the terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan and Nice, Finkielkraut is even more certain he was correct. “  today frequently serves as a pretext for not seeing the true danger that threatens us,” he told me when we met in his Paris apartment this summer. While he is still no fan of the FN, he believes it has changed and argues that it “should be resisted, but for what it is today and not what it was in the past, and not in the name of  ”. The French must, he insisted, “avoid simplistic analogies with the 1930s. We must not mistake what era we live in. Europe doesn’t only have demons it also has enemies, and it needs to know how to fight those enemies. ” He worries that integration has been such a failure that France will have to “reconquer” its “lost territories”  —   by which he means the suburbs surrounding Paris. “Integrating people is not telling them ‘You are how you are and we are how we are’   …     Integration means making them an integral part of our civilisation. ” And if that doesn’t happen, he warned darkly, “at best we’ll have secession and at worst civil war”. Continued immigration from Muslim countries, he argues, is nothing less than the “planned demise of Europe”. Across the country, nostalgia for an older, whiter France has become a potent political force. In the southern city of Béziers, Mayor Robert Ménard, a former Trotskyist who cofounded the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, is seeking to place a moratorium on the opening of kebab shops and has renamed a street after one of the French officers who joined a failed coup against De Gaulle in 1961 to prevent Algerian independence. Ménard comes from a family of   French settlers in Algeria. He regards the Evian accords that ended the Algerian war as a “capitulation” and those who tried to preserve French Algeria as heroes. This nostalgia has an unmistakable appeal, but not necessarily for the sort of voters one might expect. Whereas young Britons overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and the elderly voted to leave, in France it is the opposite. According to Julian Rochedy, the former FN youth leader, appeals to nostalgia work better with the young in France  —   who dream of an era they never witnessed  —   than with the old, who lived through the era Marine Le Pen promises to restore. It is older voters, Rochedy argues, who are the greatest obstacle to Le Pen’s victory. “They are afraid of leaving the euro,” he says. “They are afraid of huge changes. ” Rochedy is convinced that the FN will never win simply by fetishising the past. “They just want to go back 30 years,” he said of his erstwhile colleagues. “It’s a discourse that doesn’t at all take into account the world as it is and what France has become. ” Even if Le Pen cannot win over enough older voters for her to become president, there is one ageing constituency that has already moved significantly to the right  —   the former members of what used to be the largest communist party in western Europe. As the French Communist party collapsed, its supporters were left rudderless. According to Andrew Hussey, a   academic who teaches in Paris, the technocratic leaders of the Socialist party  —   many of them graduates of the   Ecole Nationale d’Administration  —   “are so disconnected from ordinary people” that even former Marxists won’t consider voting for them. Distrustful of the establishment and searching for a state that protects them, many have turned to the FN. “I think you’ve got a big political question here about who looks after you,” Hussey said. “This is a very communist way of thinking. ” Le Pen knows that she is attracting these people. Many of her supporters “used to be socialists, but they aren’t any more” she told me. Although she prefers to avoid the phrase welfare state  —   “That’s a socialist concept,” she insisted  —   Le Pen has appealed directly to this yearning for a large and nurturing state that fights for the common man and not the rich. “I defend fraternity  —   the idea that a developed country should be able to provide the poorest with the minimum needed to live with dignity as a human being. The French state no longer does that,” she told me. “We’re in a world today in which you either defend the interests of the people or the interests of the banks. ” And she has seen results. She points to the northern    region. “It was   for 80 years,” she says. “I won 45%. ” At the same time as Marine Le Pen was working to “ ” the FN, the leaders of the Dutch far right successfully seized the mantle of radicalism by positioning itself as the only force that dares to challenge an    political establishment, and the only party willing to speak out about what many voters fear: extremist Islam. Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV) have surpassed the Dutch Labour party to take up a close second place in polls ahead of the March 2017 election. Last September, Wilders declared that Europe was facing an “Islamic invasion”  —   the sort of comments that landed him in court this week on charges of inciting racial hatred, which he dismisses as an attack on freedom of expression. The presence of “masses of young men in their 20s with beards singing ‘Allahu Akbar’ across Europe” Wilders warned at the peak of last year’s refugee crisis, posed a dire threat to “our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity”. Across the country, grassroots groups responded to Wilders’s warning, attempting to block the resettlement of asylum seekers in their towns. Last October, Klaas Dijkhoff, the deputy minister responsible for refugee resettlement, arrived for a visit to the tiny   village of Oranje, where the Dutch government had decided to place 700 refugees. Outraged locals blocked the road leading to town, kicked Dijkhoff’s car and tore off its rearview mirrors. A few days later, near Utrecht, an asylum centre was attacked by masked men with smoke bombs and fireworks. In the decade following the assassinations of Fortuyn and Van Gogh, the integration of Muslim immigrants became the most divisive issue in Dutch politics. Suddenly, Turkish and   Dutch citizens became “Muslims”. And as the public debate over Islam and migration grew even more hostile, even the most basic forms of visible religious observance  —   wearing the hijab, buying halal meat, fasting during Ramadan  —   became politically loaded. The Dutch Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch, who came to the Netherlands from rural Morocco when he was 10, recounted how controversies have erupted everywhere from supermarkets to classrooms. It is a jolt to the traditionally liberal Netherlands when teenage girls tell their male teachers they can’t shake hands, or that they fast and pray while many other Dutch kids are out drinking and having sex. As Marcouch remarked, it runs against everything that Dutch youth culture promotes. Wilders’s PVV has capitalised on this cultural angst by using simple and deliberately brash slogans about immigration, crime, and refugees  —   one of his latest memes is simply “ ”  —   to win over voters who feel that everything familiar to them is slipping away. By framing its   politics as a battle against imperious elites and political correctness, the PVV has been able to capitalise on a panoply of grievances, from anger over asylum seekers to Euroscepticism. Meanwhile, many causes of the radical left  —   including   and    —   have now become establishment thinking in the Netherlands. “Idealism has been bureaucratised,” argues the journalist Bas Heijne, who writes a column in the liberal daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad. “And when the establishment enforces universalism, you react against it. ” That’s why there is such a strong   tone to the Dutch right: do not tell us what to say, what to celebrate and who we must live next to. Just as Marine Le Pen’s FN has become a huge presence on social media in France, the right is in the midst of colonising the Dutch media. Geen Stijl (“No Style”) a popular   news site featuring abrasive articles and videos, encourages its best and angriest commenters to visit mainstream news sites and go on the attack. “It is massively important,” says Tilburg University’s Merijn Oudenampsen, “like a social movement”. The site began as a blog dedicated to those who felt politically homeless after Fortuyn’s murder, and has since become a ubiquitous presence in Dutch public debate, with an army of “reactors” on Twitter. According to Oudenampsen, some politicians have told him that Geen Stijl is the first site they check in the morning. The right’s newfound media clout has also helped shape what the journalist Kustaw Bessems, from the leftwing Volkskrant newspaper, sees as a new, inverted, form of political correctness. In the old days, he says, there were taboos enforced by the left: badmouth immigrants and “you were immediately called a racist and extreme right and basically pressured to shut up”. Now, it’s the other way around. “As soon as you say anything other than ‘immigration is a problem’ or ‘Islam is the cause of terrorism’   …     the thought police immediately jump on your neck to correct you. ” A Dutch government official who focuses on security issues complained that even as the integration of Muslim immigrants and the threat of radical Islam had become the most heated and polarising issues in the Netherlands, almost none of the feverish public debate was informed by knowledge of Islamism or terrorism. While politicians fan the flames of fear, the official said, “the economists look for the economic roots of the problem, sociologists look for social causes and the anthropologists try to explain jihadi culture  —   but none of them have any idea about theology”. Even scholars of radicalisation tend to study today’s extremists through the historical lens of the European radical left  —   which does little to explain what leads a small number of young Muslim men such as Van Gogh’s killer, Mohamed Bouyeri, to devote themselves to the cause of jihad. “It’s easy to be a Marxist,” the security official quipped. “It’s fucking hard to be a salafi. ” As the perception that the state is helpless to prevent the radicalisation of Muslim teenagers deepens and the fear of terrorism increases, so does the share of voters who are newly receptive to the far right’s tirades about “Islamisation”. These days it is not only   activists pushing back against the bureaucratised consensus. There are also many disappointed progressives  —   the people who saw the cultural victories of the 1960s and 1970s as major battles that had long since been won, making sexual freedom, feminism and gay rights an unquestioned part of Dutch society. Suddenly those old victories seem tenuous. “There is a sense that, ‘We are welcoming and then they do this,’ says Bas Heijne. “They have been terribly let down in their good intentions. ” And in such an environment, traditionally leftist constituencies such as gay people and Jews feel threatened  —   and some have become reflexively suspicious of Muslims. The stereotype that observant Muslims hate gay men and lesbians has become so entrenched in the Netherlands that neither side can fathom evidence to the contrary. When the   Labour MP Ahmed Marcouch first joined in Amsterdam’s legendary gay pride parade, he was, as he puts it, the “first   Muslim” to participate. The gay community feared violence from extremists conservative Muslims were baffled and angry. Both groups concluded, “Oh, maybe Marcouch is homosexual too,” he says with a laugh. Neither group could imagine a straight Muslim doing what he did. But public displays of solidarity such as Marcouch’s are rare. Among openly gay couples and religious Jews alike, there is a palpable fear of being targeted by homophobic or antisemitic young Muslim men. Much as in France, this fraught atmosphere has made   parties seem a palatable option for groups who would never previously have considered voting for them. In Amsterdam earlier this year, I had several meetings with a staunch Jewish supporter of Wilders’s PVV, who insisted on remaining anonymous. He described his own backing for the far right in terms that echoed Alain Finkielkraut. “It’s an outdated reflex for Jews to always say the problem is the extreme right,” he told me. “We have new enemies and we need new ideas. ” The experience of his own family during the second world war has convinced him that Europe’s capacity for murderous violence is always lurking beneath the surface. “Anne Frank wasn’t betrayed by the Germans,” he argued. “But by Dutch people. Regular Dutch. ” Jews need to find new allies in a new war, he argues, because they will never be safe. “The trains for the Jews will always come,” he added, ominously. “I’d rather be wrong than be too calm and end up on the trains. ” He is not unsympathetic to the plight of European Muslims, and told me that he even sees parallels with the persecution his own family faced. “If I were a Muslim in Europe at this moment I’d be very uneasy,” he admitted. “If Europeans regain their manhood, it could be bad. It’s the history of Europe to treat foreigners terribly. We Jews know that. ” For that reason, he argues, Muslims should regard Wilders as a lesser evil. “Every Muslim should be happy Geert Wilders exists. If someone else channelled these hateful feelings it would be much worse,” he told me menacingly. “Wilders is civil. He is a democrat. He is not the new Hitler. ” To Frits Bolkestein, who led the Netherlands’   VVD in the 1990s  —   and was briefly Wilders’ boss when he was a young aide in the party office  —   the rise of the far right is as much about class as it is about Islam. The Dutch Labour party, he argues, gave up on its   base: “They made a major mistake,” he says of his old rivals, with a tinge of satisfaction. Faced with “the choice between the   and the labour classes, they chose the     …     and they’ve paid for it dearly”. Current polls project that the party will drop from the 36 seats it now holds (out of 150) to just 10. Marcouch concedes that, like the old leftists in France, many former Labour voters now back Wilders. Moreover, he says, they still live in the very neighbourhoods that families such as his own moved into in the 1980s, as many white Dutch families were moving out. “Their message to the Labour party,” he said, “is: ‘You ignored us. You let it happen. ’” The Danish People’s Party has been seeking out such voters for years, and they have masterfully leveraged   sentiment to siphon away the Social Democrats’ traditional base  —   people who fear that the “bread will be buttered more thinly” as the Danish journalist Lars Trier Mogensen puts it. The DPP has effectively combined   rhetoric with a strong   message that stresses quality health benefits and good care for the elderly. Søren Espersen, the DPP’s deputy leader, doesn’t think that former Social Democrats will ever go back. “When one of those takes the step to vote for us, it is a very, very huge step he is taking,” he says of voters who supported the Social Democrats all their lives. “And why should he go back? I mean, to come over this first hurdle of voting for us, then he’s done it. ” The Social Democrats first began to lose their dominance in and around the major cities in the 1990s, with many of their votes going to the DPP. One of those places is the small satellite town of Herlev, about 10 miles west of Copenhagen. The    Social Democratic mayor, Thomas Gyldal Petersen, has lived there all his life, and he is adamant that controlling immigration numbers is the only way to reverse his party’s political misfortunes. For Gyldal Petersen, the key to successful integration is a demographic balance. As soon as a school or housing estate becomes majority immigrant  —   or majority unemployed  —   he says, problems start to arise. He blames his own party’s leaders: “Mayors in the 80s, they were warning, something is going wrong, you have to change. ” But the party leadership “shut their eyes” he says. Then came the Muhammad cartoons. In 2005, the editors at   Denmark’s largest newspaper, invited a group of   cartoonists to draw the prophet. The initial response was underwhelming, but within a few months  —   through a combination of diplomatic pressure, a dismissive response from the Danish government, and a concerted campaign by local imams  —   the cartoons became a   crisis, with boycotts of Danish products and violent protests occurring throughout the Middle East. Danes who had never contemplated voting for the DPP now saw their embassies on fire and death threats against some of their   journalists. Suddenly, the DPP’s platform was making sense. They had warned that Muslims were extremists in waiting, and now those warnings seemed to come true. Politicians such as Naser Khader, who once warned that giving the DPP influence would weaken them, found themselves moving steadily to the right of the political spectrum. When Khader founded a new organisation called “Democratic Muslims” in the wake of the cartoon controversy, he received death threats. Those at the top of the Social Democrats are now taking a tough stance, too. Earlier this year the party leader, Mette Frederiksen, went to Stockholm to meet with fellow Scandinavian social democrats. There she gave a speech that rattled her colleagues. “We social democrats must accept that there is a clash,” she declared. “It is a very strong part of our identity that we help when people need help   …     but just as strong is our value that we must have a   welfare state. ” Frederiksen continued: “My position is that a universally funded Scandinavian welfare state with free and equal access to healthcare, education and social subsidies is not compatible with an open immigration policy. ” But in its zeal to get tough on migration, Denmark has damaged its international reputation as a bastion of progressivism  —   the sort of place that Bernie Sanders liked to mention at campaign rallies. In January, just three months after the refugee crisis peaked, Denmark passed what became known as the “jewellery law” which stipulated that any refugees carrying valuables worth more than 10, 000 kroner (£1, 200) would have them confiscated to fund the cost of accommodating  . Editorial pages and columnists across the world lined up to condemn the law. According to Kenneth Kristensen Berth, a babyfaced MP for the DPP, it was about deterrence. “The goal was, of course, that we should try to tell people that they should not seek asylum in Denmark,” he said. The jewellery provision was a minor part. “More important is the fact that many people will be waiting longer for family reunification, like waiting three years,” he added. And it wasn’t just the DPP and government who supported it  —   the Social Democrats voted for it, too. Bent Melchior, Denmark’s    former chief rabbi, was outraged. He bristled at the suggestion that refugees are rich because they flee with some money in their pockets. He would know: although Denmark is always hailed for saving its Jews during the second world war, it is often forgotten that Danish Jews paid fishermen huge sums to ferry them across to Sweden. Melchior’s family paid the equivalent of “almost a year’s rent of a   flat” just for his own passage. “Denmark is not a poor country, for God’s sake,” Melchior says. “There’s food for everybody here, and even if we get a few tens of thousands more people, there will still be food for everybody. ” The road that led a   party to support such a law has been long and tortuous, but the trajectory has been clear. The Scandinavian welfare system has always been premised on solidarity, with everyone paying their fair share and receiving what they deserve. As the country has become more diverse, some of the trust sustaining it has broken down. There has been abuse of the system by immigrants, and there has been even more tabloid fearmongering depicting immigrants as cheats and leeches sucking the system dry. But the larger issue, as the Oxford economist Paul Collier has argued, is the growing unwillingness of natives to subsidise those seen as the foreign poor. Herlev’s mayor does not oppose asylum, but he insists that the numbers have to be capped. “We have to help refugees, and we have to take refugees to Denmark in a number that we can help. If the balance tips, the welfare society cannot hold together,” Petersen warns. But such balance may only help so much. Aydin Soei, a Danish sociologist and the son of immigrants from Iran, believes there is a larger blind spot in the thinking of the Danish government  —   one that native Danes who have never been on the receiving end of the state’s integration policy have failed to see. “A lot of refugees were just parked on social welfare instead of [the state] recognising their education and their skills,” Soei told me, citing the case of his own mother, who arrived in Denmark with a physics degree that was regarded as worthless. “If your motivation is to create a liberal society where the individual can create a good life for him or herself, then you would have solved this problem years ago,” he argues. Instead the state has effectively provided newcomers with an allowance and keys to an apartment, and ignored them  —   assuming that its work was done. The problem, Soei claims, is that there is no political incentive to integrate asylum seekers into the job market. “It doesn’t have consequences for the politicians   …     because they don’t have the right to vote. ” Either way, it plays into the DPP’s argument. “Immigrants can’t do right,” said Gyldal Petersen. “When they’re unemployed they’re a burden to society. When they’re in a job, they just stole the job from a Dane. ” Whether or not Marine Le Pen wins next year’s French election or Wilders’ PVV becomes the largest party in the Netherlands, the new far right is not going away. The reflex among many establishment parties  —   and media institutions  —   has been to dismiss them, sideline them or mock them. Others, however, have begun to mimic them in an effort to win their old voters back. Rhetoric might, in the long run, matter more than election results. When I spoke again recently with the Jewish Wilders supporter from Amsterdam, he was convinced that the battle has in some ways already been won  —   regardless of the outcome of next year’s elections. “The PVV has shifted the whole political discussion to the right. The Labour party is saying almost exactly the same thing Wilders said five years ago,” he told me. “You can have a lot of influence in politics by steering the debate. ” If traditional political parties want to win, they must first abandon the old strategy of marginalising populist movements and instead engage them on the merits  —   and flaws  —   of their policies and counter their messages of fear. Not least among the lessons of Brexit was that, for millions of disaffected voters, immigration is just one more thing nobody asked them about. This is what makes the issue an especially potent weapon: it combines the resentful energies of nativism, economic instability, and hatred of a remote and unaccountable political elite. And the leaders of the new far right have learned to wield it effectively. They know better than to let themselves be dismissed, as   Le Pen was, as antisemites or racists.  In France, the new majority Marine Le Pen hopes to build is strikingly similar to the coalition that brought the Brexit campaign victory. In a park near Calais’   town hall in May, Samuel and Pascal, activists from a group named Retake Calais, railed against the town’s   mayor. They blamed her for the growth of the sprawling,   tent city known as the Jungle, which sat three miles east of the town until it was dismantled this month. “Those who govern us are completely against us. The illegals, who aren’t French, can do whatever they want,” they told me. For them, even Marine Le Pen is “too soft”. If resettlement programmes take refugees away from Calais to other parts of France, as dozens of buses have in the past week since the destruction of the camp, they would not be any happier. “They’re sending them to all the little villages in France,” says Samuel. After they start to open businesses and bring family members, “in two years the village will be dead”. About a mile down the road, the Calais ferry terminal lies behind layers of tall steel fences and coiled barbed wire. I met Rudy Vercucque and Yohann Faviere, the local FN leaders, on a blustery morning in June outside the terminal, where they were anxiously awaiting a visiting EU dignitary. Giant seagulls circled and squawked above as they denounced the mayor, Natacha Bouchart, a member of Sarkozy’s Republicans party. “It’s she who has permitted this,” Vercucque, a portly    fumed. And it was Sarkozy, he reminded me, who negotiated the notorious Le Touquet accords, effectively moving the British border to where we were standing. Calais depends on British tourism and revenues are down sharply. The result is crippling economic and social malaise: “Find a doctor who wants to move to Calais. Find a surgeon who wants to move to Calais,” Vercucque exclaimed. “You work your whole life, you pay off your house and you lose money. It’s intolerable. ” Their support locally may have once been a protest vote, said Faviere, but no longer. “Today we really have people who adhere to our ideas. ” Vercucque was more blunt: “We say out loud what people think deep down. ” • Sasha   is an Open Society Fellow.

"One Monday morning last September, Britain woke to a depraved news story. The prime minister, David Cameron, had committed an “obscene act with a dead pig’s head” according to the Daily Mail. “A distinguished Oxford contemporary claims Cameron once took part in an outrageous initiation ceremony at a Piers Gaveston event, involving a dead pig,” the paper reported. Piers Gaveston is the name of a riotous Oxford university dining society the authors of the story claimed their source was an MP, who said he had seen photographic evidence: “His extraordinary suggestion is that the future PM inserted a private part of his anatomy into the animal. ” The story, extracted from a new biography of Cameron, sparked an immediate furore. It was gross, it was a great opportunity to humiliate an elitist prime minister, and many felt it rang true for a former member of the notorious Bullingdon Club. Within minutes, #Piggate and #Hameron were trending on Twitter, and even senior politicians joined the fun: Nicola Sturgeon said the allegations had “entertained the whole country” while Paddy Ashdown joked that Cameron was “hogging the headlines”. At first, the BBC refused to mention the allegations, and 10 Downing Street said it would not “dignify” the story with a response  —   but soon it was forced to issue a denial. And so a powerful man was sexually shamed, in a way that had nothing to do with his divisive politics, and in a way he could never really respond to. But who cares? He could take it. Then, after a full day of online merriment, something shocking happened. Isabel Oakeshott, the Daily Mail journalist who had   the biography with Lord Ashcroft, a billionaire businessman, went on TV and admitted that she did not know whether her huge, scandalous scoop was even true. Pressed to provide evidence for the sensational claim, Oakeshott admitted she had none. “We couldn’t get to the bottom of that source’s allegations,” she said on Channel 4 News. “So we merely reported the account that the source gave us   …     We don’t say whether we believe it to be true. ” In other words, there was no evidence that the prime minister of the United Kingdom had once “inserted a private part of his anatomy” into the mouth of a dead pig  —   a story reported in dozens of newspapers and repeated in millions of tweets and Facebook updates, which many people presumably still believe to be true today. Oakeshott went even further to absolve herself of any journalistic responsibility: “It’s up to other people to decide whether they give it any credibility or not,” she concluded. This was not, of course, the first time that outlandish claims were published on the basis of flimsy evidence, but this was an unusually brazen defence. It seemed that journalists were no longer required to believe their own stories to be true, nor, apparently, did they need to provide evidence. Instead it was up to the reader  —   who does not even know the identity of the source  —   to make up their own mind. But based on what? Gut instinct, intuition, mood? Does the truth matter any more? Nine months after Britain woke up giggling at Cameron’s hypothetical porcine intimacies, the country arose on the morning of 24 June to the very real sight of the prime minister standing outside Downing Street at 8am, announcing his own resignation. “The British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected,” Cameron declared. “It was not a decision that was taken lightly, not least because so many things were said by so many different organisations about the significance of this decision. So there can be no doubt about the result. ” But what soon became clear was that almost everything was still in doubt. At the end of a campaign that dominated the news for months, it was suddenly obvious that the winning side had no plan for how or when the UK would leave the EU  —   while the deceptive claims that carried the leave campaign to victory suddenly crumbled. At 6. 31am on Friday 24 June, just over an hour after the result of the EU referendum had become clear, Ukip leader Nigel Farage conceded that a   UK would not in fact have £350m a week spare to spend on the NHS  —   a key claim of Brexiteers that was even emblazoned on the Vote Leave campaign bus. A few hours later, the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan stated that immigration was not likely to be reduced  —   another key claim. It was hardly the first time that politicians had failed to deliver what they promised, but it might have been the first time they admitted on the morning after victory that the promises had been false all along. This was the first major vote in the era of   politics: the listless remain campaign attempted to fight fantasy with facts, but quickly found that the currency of fact had been badly debased. The remain side’s worrying facts and worried experts were dismissed as “Project Fear”  —   and quickly neutralised by opposing “facts”: if 99 experts said the economy would crash and one disagreed, the BBC told us that each side had a different view of the situation. (This is a disastrous mistake that ends up obscuring truth, and echoes how some report climate change.) Michael Gove declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts” on Sky News. He also compared 10 Nobel   economists who signed an   letter to Nazi scientists loyal to Hitler. For months, the Eurosceptic press trumpeted every dubious claim and rubbished every expert warning, filling the front pages with too many confected   headlines to count  —   many of them later quietly corrected in very small print. A week before the vote  —   on the same day Nigel Farage unveiled his inflammatory “Breaking Point” poster, and the Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned tirelessly for refugees, was shot dead  —   the cover of the Daily Mail featured a picture of migrants in the back of a lorry entering the UK, with the headline “We are from Europe  —   let us in!” The next day, the Mail and the Sun, which also carried the story, were forced to admit that the stowaways were actually from Iraq and Kuwait. The brazen disregard for facts did not stop after the referendum: just this weekend, the   Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom, fresh from a starring role in the leave campaign, demonstrated the waning power of evidence. After telling the Times that being a mother would make her a better PM than her rival Theresa May, she cried “gutter journalism!” and accused the newspaper of misrepresenting her remarks  —   even though she said exactly that, clearly and definitively and on tape. Leadsom is a   politician even about her own truths. When a fact begins to resemble whatever you feel is true, it becomes very difficult for anyone to tell the difference between facts that are true and “facts” that are not. The leave campaign was well aware of this  —   and took full advantage, safe in the knowledge that the Advertising Standards Authority has no power to police political claims. A few days after the vote, Arron Banks, Ukip’s largest donor and the main funder of the Leave. EU campaign, told the Guardian that his side knew all along that facts would not win the day. “It was taking an   media approach,” said Banks. “What they said early on was ‘Facts don’t work’ and that’s it. The remain campaign featured fact, fact, fact, fact, fact. It just doesn’t work. You have got to connect with people emotionally. It’s the Trump success. ” It was little surprise that some people were shocked after the result to discover that Brexit might have serious consequences and few of the promised benefits. When “facts don’t work” and voters don’t trust the media, everyone believes in their own “truth”  —   and the results, as we have just seen, can be devastating. How did we end up here? And how do we fix it?   years after the first website went online, it is clear that we are living through a period of dizzying transition. For 500 years after Gutenberg, the dominant form of information was the printed page: knowledge was primarily delivered in a fixed format, one that encouraged readers to believe in stable and settled truths. Now, we are caught in a series of confusing battles between opposing forces: between truth and falsehood, fact and rumour, kindness and cruelty between the few and the many, the connected and the alienated between the open platform of the web as its architects envisioned it and the gated enclosures of Facebook and other social networks between an informed public and a misguided mob. What is common to these struggles  —   and what makes their resolution an urgent matter  —   is that they all involve the diminishing status of truth. This does not mean that there are no truths. It simply means, as this year has made very clear, that we cannot agree on what those truths are, and when there is no consensus about the truth and no way to achieve it, chaos soon follows. Increasingly, what counts as a fact is merely a view that someone feels to be true  —   and technology has made it very easy for these “facts” to circulate with a speed and reach that was unimaginable in the Gutenberg era (or even a decade ago). A dubious story about Cameron and a pig appears in a tabloid one morning, and by noon, it has flown around the world on social media and turned up in trusted news sources everywhere. This may seem like a small matter, but its consequences are enormous. “The Truth” as Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote in Stick It Up Your Punter! their history of the Sun newspaper, is a “bald statement which every newspaper prints at its peril”. There are usually several conflicting truths on any given subject, but in the era of the printing press, words on a page nailed things down, whether they turned out to be true or not. The information felt like the truth, at least until the next day brought another update or a correction, and we all shared a common set of facts. This settled “truth” was usually handed down from above: an established truth, often fixed in place by an establishment. This arrangement was not without flaws: too much of the press often exhibited a bias towards the status quo and a deference to authority, and it was prohibitively difficult for ordinary people to challenge the power of the press. Now, people distrust much of what is presented as fact  —   particularly if the facts in question are uncomfortable, or out of sync with their own views  —   and while some of that distrust is misplaced, some of it is not. In the digital age, it is easier than ever to publish false information, which is quickly shared and taken to be true  —   as we often see in emergency situations, when news is breaking in real time. To pick one example among many, during the November 2015 Paris terror attacks, rumours quickly spread on social media that the Louvre and Pompidou Centre had been hit, and that François Hollande had suffered a stroke. Trusted news organisations are needed to debunk such tall tales. Sometimes rumours like these spread out of panic, sometimes out of malice, and sometimes deliberate manipulation, in which a corporation or regime pays people to convey their message. Whatever the motive, falsehoods and facts now spread the same way, through what academics call an “information cascade”. As the legal scholar and   expert Danielle Citron describes it, “people forward on what others think, even if the information is false, misleading or incomplete, because they think they have learned something valuable. ” This cycle repeats itself, and before you know it, the cascade has unstoppable momentum. You share a friend’s post on Facebook, perhaps to show kinship or agreement or that you’re “in the know” and thus you increase the visibility of their post to others. Algorithms such as the one that powers Facebook’s news feed are designed to give us more of what they think we want  —   which means that the version of the world we encounter every day in our own personal stream has been invisibly curated to reinforce our   beliefs. When Eli Pariser, the   of Upworthy, coined the term “filter bubble” in 2011, he was talking about how the personalised web  —   and in particular Google’s personalised search function, which means that no two people’s Google searches are the same  —   means that we are less likely to be exposed to information that challenges us or broadens our worldview, and less likely to encounter facts that disprove false information that others have shared. Pariser’s plea, at the time, was that those running social media platforms should ensure that “their algorithms prioritise countervailing views and news that’s important, not just the stuff that’s most popular or most  ”. But in less than five years, thanks to the incredible power of a few social platforms, the filter bubble that Pariser described has become much more extreme. On the day after the EU referendum, in a Facebook post, the British internet activist and mySociety founder, Tom Steinberg, provided a vivid illustration of the power of the filter bubble  —   and the serious civic consequences for a world where information flows largely through social networks: I am actively searching through Facebook for people celebrating the Brexit leave victory, but the filter bubble is SO strong, and extends SO far into things like Facebook’s custom search that I can’t find anyone who is happy *despite the fact that over half the country is clearly jubilant today* and despite the fact that I’m *actively* looking to hear what they are saying. This   problem is now SO severe and SO chronic that I can only beg any friends I have who actually work for Facebook and other major social media and technology to urgently tell their leaders that to not act on this problem now is tantamount to actively supporting and funding the tearing apart of the fabric of our societies   …     We’re getting countries where one half just doesn’t know anything at all about the other. But asking technology companies to “do something” about the filter bubble presumes that this is a problem that can be easily fixed  —   rather than one baked into the very idea of social networks that are designed to give you what you and your friends want to see. Facebook, which launched only in 2004, now has 1. 6bn users worldwide. It has become the dominant way for people to find news on the internet  —   and in fact it is dominant in ways that would have been impossible to imagine in the newspaper era. As Emily Bell has written: “Social media hasn’t just swallowed journalism, it has swallowed everything. It has swallowed political campaigns, banking systems, personal histories, the leisure industry, retail, even government and security. ” Bell, the director of the Tow Centre for Digital Journalism at Columbia University  —   and a board member of the Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian  —   has outlined the seismic impact of social media for journalism. “Our news ecosystem has changed more dramatically in the past five years,” she wrote in March, “than perhaps at any time in the past 500. ” The future of publishing is being put into the “hands of the few, who now control the destiny of the many”. News publishers have lost control over the distribution of their journalism, which for many readers is now “filtered through algorithms and platforms which are opaque and unpredictable”. This means that social media companies have become overwhelmingly powerful in determining what we read  —   and enormously profitable from the monetisation of other people’s work. As Bell notes: “There is a far greater concentration of power in this respect than there has ever been in the past. ” Publications curated by editors have in many cases been replaced by a stream of information chosen by friends, contacts and family, processed by secret algorithms. The old idea of a   web  —   where hyperlinks from site to site created a   and decentralised network of information  —   has been largely supplanted by platforms designed to maximise your time within their walls, some of which (such as Instagram and Snapchat) do not allow outward links at all. Many people, in fact, especially teenagers, now spend more and more of their time on closed chat apps, which allow users to create groups to share messages privately  —   perhaps because young people, who are most likely to have faced harassment online, are seeking more carefully protected social spaces. But the closed space of a chat app is an even more restrictive silo than the walled garden of Facebook or other social networks. As the pioneering Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan, who was imprisoned in Tehran for six years for his online activity, wrote in the Guardian earlier this year, the “diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned” has given way to “the centralisation of information” inside a select few social networks  —   and the end result is “making us all less powerful in relation to government and corporations”. Of course, Facebook does not decide what you read  —   at least not in the traditional sense of making decisions  —   and nor does it dictate what news organisations produce. But when one platform becomes the dominant source for accessing information, news organisations will often tailor their own work to the demands of this new medium. (The most visible evidence of Facebook’s influence on journalism is the panic that accompanies any change in the news feed algorithm that threatens to reduce the page views sent to publishers.) In the last few years, many news organisations have steered themselves away from   journalism and toward   news, chasing page views in the vain hope of attracting clicks and advertising (or investment)  —   but like junk food, you hate yourself when you’ve gorged on it. The most extreme manifestation of this phenomenon has been the creation of fake news farms, which attract traffic with false reports that are designed to look like real news, and are therefore widely shared on social networks. But the same principle applies to news that is misleading or sensationally dishonest, even if it wasn’t created to deceive: the new measure of value for too many news organisations is virality rather than truth or quality. Of course, journalists have got things wrong in the past  —   either by mistake or prejudice or sometimes by intent. (Freddie Starr probably didn’t eat a hamster.) So it would be a mistake to think this is a new phenomenon of the digital age. But what is new and significant is that today, rumours and lies are read just as widely as   facts  —   and often more widely, because they are wilder than reality and more exciting to share. The cynicism of this approach was expressed most nakedly by Neetzan Zimmerman, formerly employed by Gawker as a specialist in   viral stories. “Nowadays it’s not important if a story’s real,” he said in 2014. “The only thing that really matters is whether people click on it. ” Facts, he suggested, are over they are a relic from the age of the printing press, when readers had no choice. He continued: “If a person is not sharing a news story, it is, at its core, not news. ” The increasing prevalence of this approach suggests that we are in the midst of a fundamental change in the values of journalism  —   a consumerist shift. Instead of strengthening social bonds, or creating an informed public, or the idea of news as a civic good, a democratic necessity, it creates gangs, which spread instant falsehoods that fit their views, reinforcing each other’s beliefs, driving each other deeper into shared opinions, rather than established facts. But the trouble is that the business model of most digital news organisations is based around clicks. News media around the world has reached a   of frenzied   in order to scrape up digital advertising’s pennies and cents. (And there’s not much advertising to be got: in the first quarter of 2016, 85 cents of every new dollar spent in the US on online advertising went to Google and Facebook. That used to go to news publishers.) In the news feed on your phone, all stories look the same  —   whether they come from a credible source or not. And, increasingly,   sources are also publishing false, misleading, or deliberately outrageous stories. “Clickbait is king, so newsrooms will uncritically print some of the worst stuff out there, which lends legitimacy to bullshit,” said Brooke Binkowski, an editor at the debunking website Snopes, in an interview with the Guardian in April. “Not all newsrooms are like this, but a lot of them are. ” We should be careful not to dismiss anything with an appealing digital headline as clickbait  —   appealing headlines are a good thing, if they lead the reader to quality journalism, both serious and not. My belief is that what distinguishes good journalism from poor journalism is labour: the journalism that people value the most is that for which they can tell someone has put in a lot of work  —   where they can feel the effort that has been expended on their behalf, over tasks big or small, important or entertaining. It is the reverse of   “churnalism” the endless recycling of other people’s stories for clicks. The digital advertising model doesn’t currently discriminate between true or not true, just big or small. As the American political reporter Dave Weigel wrote in the wake of a hoax story that became a viral hit all the way back in 2013: “‘Too good to check’ used to be a warning to newspaper editors not to jump on bullshit stories. Now it’s a business model. ” A   industry desperately chasing down every cheap click doesn’t sound like an industry in a position of strength, and indeed, news publishing as a business is in trouble. The shift to digital publishing has been a thrilling development for journalism  —   as I said in my 2013 AN Smith lecture at the University of Melbourne, “The Rise of the Reader” it has induced “a fundamental redrawing of journalists’ relationship with our audience, how we think about our readers, our perception of our role in society, our status”. It has meant we have found new ways to get stories  —   from our audience, from data, from social media. It has given us new ways to tell stories  —   with interactive technologies and now with virtual reality. It has given us new ways to distribute our journalism, to find new readers in surprising places and it has given us new ways to engage with our audiences, opening ourselves up to challenge and debate. But while the possibilities for journalism have been strengthened by the digital developments of the last few years, the business model is under grave threat, because no matter how many clicks you get, it will never be enough. And if you charge readers to access your journalism you have a big challenge to persuade the digital consumer who is used to getting information for free to part with their cash. News publishers everywhere are seeing profits and revenue drop dramatically. If you want a stark illustration of the new realities of digital media, consider the   financial results announced by the New York Times and Facebook within a week of one another earlier this year. The New York Times announced that its operating profits had fallen by 13% to $51. 5m  —   healthier than most of the rest of the publishing industry, but quite a drop. Facebook, meanwhile, revealed that its net income had tripled in the same period  —   to a quite staggering $1. 51bn. Many journalists have lost their jobs in the past decade. The number of journalists in the UK shrank by up to   between 2001 and 2010 US newsrooms declined by a similar amount between 2006 and 2013. In Australia, there was a 20% cut in the journalistic workforce between 2012 and 2014 alone. Earlier this year, at the Guardian we announced that we would need to lose 100 journalistic positions. In March, the Independent ceased existing as a print newspaper. Since 2005, according to research by Press Gazette, the number of local newspapers in the UK has fallen by 181  —   again, not because of a problem with journalism, but because of a problem with funding it. But journalists losing their jobs is not simply a problem for journalists: it has a damaging impact on the entire culture. As the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas warned, back in 2007: “When reorganisation and   in this core area jeopardise accustomed journalistic standards, it hits at the very heart of the political public sphere. Because, without the flow of information gained through extensive research, and without the stimulation of arguments based on an expertise that doesn’t come cheap, public communication loses its discursive vitality. The public media would then cease to resist populist tendencies, and could no longer fulfil the function it should in the context of a democratic constitutional state. ” Perhaps, then, the focus of the news industry needs to turn to commercial innovation: how to rescue the funding of journalism, which is what is under threat. Journalism has seen dramatic innovation in the last two digital decades, but business models have not. In the words of my colleague Mary Hamilton, the Guardian’s executive editor for audience: “We’ve transformed everything about our journalism and not enough about our businesses. ” The impact on journalism of the crisis in the business model is that, in chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity, news organisations undermine the very reason they exist: to find things out and tell readers the truth  —   to report, report, report. Many newsrooms are in danger of losing what matters most about journalism: the valuable, civic,          hard graft of uncovering things that someone doesn’t want you to know. Serious,   journalism is demanding, and there is more of a need for it than ever. It helps keep the powerful honest it helps people make sense of the world and their place in it. Facts and reliable information are essential for the functioning of democracy  —   and the digital era has made that even more obvious. But we must not allow the chaos of the present to cast the past in a rosy light  —   as can be seen from the recent resolution to a tragedy that became one of the darkest moments in the history of British journalism. At the end of April, a    inquest ruled that the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 had been unlawfully killed and had not contributed to the dangerous situation at the football ground. The verdict was the culmination of an indefatigable    by the victims’ families, whose case was reported for two decades with great detail and sensitivity by Guardian journalist David Conn. His journalism helped uncover the real truth about what happened at Hillsborough, and the subsequent   by the police  —   a classic example of a reporter holding the powerful to account on behalf of the less powerful. What the families had been campaigning against for nearly three decades was a lie put into circulation by the Sun. The tabloid’s aggressive rightwing editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, blamed the fans for the disaster, suggesting they had forced their way into the ground without tickets  —   a claim later revealed to be false. According to Horrie and Chippindale’s history of The Sun, MacKenzie overruled his own reporter and put the words “THE TRUTH” on the front page, alleging that Liverpool fans were drunk, that they picked the pockets of victims, that they punched, kicked and urinated on police officers, that they shouted that they wanted sex with a dead female victim. The fans, said a “  police officer” were “acting like animals”. The story, as Chippindale and Horrie write, is a “classic smear” free of any attributable evidence and “precisely fitting MacKenzie’s formula by publicising the   ignorant prejudice being voiced all over the country”. It is hard to imagine that Hillsborough could happen now: if 96 people were crushed to death in front of 53, 000 smartphones, with photographs and eyewitness accounts all posted to social media, would it have taken so long for the truth to come out? Today, the police  —   or Kelvin MacKenzie  —   would not have been able to lie so blatantly and for so long. The truth is a struggle. It takes hard graft. But the struggle is worth it: traditional news values are important and they matter and they are worth defending. The digital revolution has meant that journalists  —   rightly, in my view  —   are more accountable to their audience. And as the Hillsborough story shows, the old media were certainly capable of perpetrating appalling falsehoods, which could take years to unravel. Some of the old hierarchies have been decisively undermined, which has led to a more open debate and a more substantial challenge to the old elites whose interests often dominated the media. But the age of relentless and instant information  —   and uncertain truths  —   can be overwhelming. We careen from outrage to outrage, but forget each one very quickly: it’s doomsday every afternoon. At the same time, the levelling of the information landscape has unleashed new torrents of racism and sexism and new means of shaming and harassment, suggesting a world in which the loudest and crudest arguments will prevail. It is an atmosphere that has proved particularly hostile to women and people of colour, revealing that the inequalities of the physical world are reproduced all too easily in online spaces. The Guardian is not immune  —   which is why one of my first initiatives as    was to launch the Web We Want project, in order to combat a general culture of online abuse and ask how we as an institution can foster better and more civil conversations on the web. Above all, the challenge for journalism today is not simply technological innovation or the creation of new business models. It is to establish what role journalistic organisations still play in a public discourse that has become impossibly fragmented and radically destabilised. The stunning political developments of the past year  —   including the vote for Brexit and the emergence of Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for the US presidency  —   are not simply the byproducts of a resurgent populism or the revolt of those left behind by global capitalism. As the academic Zeynep Tufekci argued in an essay earlier this year, the rise of Trump “is actually a symptom of the mass media’s growing weakness, especially in controlling the limits of what it is acceptable to say”. (A similar case could be made for the Brexit campaign.) “For decades, journalists at major media organisations acted as gatekeepers who passed judgment on what ideas could be publicly discussed, and what was considered too radical,” Tufekci wrote. The weakening of these gatekeepers is both positive and negative there are opportunities and there are dangers. As we can see from the past, the old gatekeepers were also capable of great harm, and they were often imperious in refusing space to arguments they deemed outside the mainstream political consensus. But without some form of consensus, it is hard for any truth to take hold. The decline of the gatekeepers has given Trump space to raise formerly taboo subjects, such as the cost of a global   regime that benefits corporations rather than workers, an issue that American elites and much of the media had long dismissed  —   as well as, more obviously, allowing his outrageous lies to flourish. When the prevailing mood is   and   trust in big institutions, including the media, begins to crumble. I believe that a strong journalistic culture is worth fighting for. So is a business model that serves and rewards media organisations that put the search for truth at the heart of everything  —   building an informed, active public that scrutinises the powerful, not an   reactionary gang that attacks the vulnerable. Traditional news values must be embraced and celebrated: reporting, verifying, gathering together eyewitness statements, making a serious attempt to discover what really happened. We are privileged to live in an era when we can use many new technologies  —   and the help of our audience  —   to do that. But we must also grapple with the issues underpinning digital culture, and realise that the shift from print to digital media was never just about technology. We must also address the new power dynamics that these changes have created. Technology and media do not exist in isolation  —   they help shape society, just as they are shaped by it in turn. That means engaging with people as civic actors, citizens, equals. It is about holding power to account, fighting for a public space, and taking responsibility for creating the kind of world we want to live in.

"Perhaps the most surprising thing is that it has taken Carrie Fisher so long to fess up. The famously candid actor and memoirist has been asked numerous times whether there was a   romance on the set of Star Wars, to mirror the relationship between Princess Leia and Han Solo. No, of course not, she would invariably reply: she was a teenager, Harrison Ford was 14 years older, they couldn’t have been more different, what a daft idea. Now she has written The Princess Diarist, in which she calls on the journals she wrote at the time, to reveal that she had an intense affair with Ford. The diaries, and accompanying poems, make for painful reading. Here is a    riddled with   and angst, already in therapy but yet to be diagnosed as bipolar, pretending to be a woman of the world. She falls obsessively in love with Ford, who, while happy to sleep with her, does not appear to feel the same way. Fisher has always written about herself with   honesty (notably in Postcards From The Edge, the fictionalised account of an overdose). Why has she waited so long to tell this story? A number of reasons, she says, talking down the line to me from Los Angeles, her voice thick with bronchitis (our interview in London was cancelled when she fell ill). The most important was the discovery of the journals, which she found in boxes under the floorboards when she was renovating her house. “I hadn’t seen them in 40 years. After all this time, I had genuinely forgotten they existed. And I thought they were this incredible archaeological find. ” Enough time has passed, she says, to enable her to tell the story. “It wasn’t just my secret to keep,” she says, meaning that Ford was married at the time of their affair, to Mary Marquardt. Shortly afterwards, he divorced, and married ET screenwriter Melissa Mathison, a close friend of Fisher’s, who died last year. Was it out of respect for Mathison that she did not write about their relationship? “No, not at all. Melissa always felt it was not that big of a deal. But then she wasn’t the wife. ” Is she doing it for the money? Fisher laughs. “Oh, it wasn’t that much money. I had a   deal, so it wasn’t like they said, ‘We’ll pay you a million dollars to tell some secret thing.’ I was just wondering if I’d have the nerve to do it. ” Rereading her diaries, Fisher says she was startled by her passion. It enabled her to write about herself in a way she never has before  —   not   with irony or wisecracks, but straight from the heart. Her daughter, Billie Lourd, read it with her for the audiobook, and “she thought it was so emotional, she had never seen me like that. No one has. This is the most personal thing I have written. ” One of the questions she repeatedly asks herself in the diaries is whether Ford has a clue how she feels. What does she think now? “I don’t think, until now, he knew the intensity of my feelings. ” As for herself, she says she has probably tried to bury those emotions over the years. “Even in the diary I don’t like to admit it, because it’s a failure. ” She pauses, and starts again. “No, it’s not a failure  —   it’s unreciprocated love. ” Another pause. “Which I guess is a type of failure. ” I ask her what Ford, now married to the actor Calista Flockhart, thinks of the book. She says she doesn’t know. “I told him I was writing the book, and I would give it to him and if he didn’t like anything in it I would take it out, and he seemed surprised at that. Then I called him and said I’m going to send it to you, and I did and I never heard from him. ” She knows he is unlikely to thank her for making the story public. Ford is as taciturn as she is garrulous, as private as she is confessional. “I don’t think he wants anything known about his life,” she admits, “and he’s lived it accordingly. I certainly don’t want to say anything that would do more than embarrass him. Anything private embarrasses him. ” The affair with Ford took her by surprise. “I was shocked by the fact that he fancied me. I was a very insecure girl and had only had one boyfriend. ” She writes that he whisked her off when she was tipsy, and asks herself whether he took advantage of her. What does she think now? “Oh no, never. It wasn’t that kind of thing at all. ” In fact, she says, there was no way he could have known how innocent she was, because she had deliberately painted a false picture of herself. “He perceived me as this very confident, experienced girl. I don’t think he had all the information! And when he got it, he behaved accordingly, and he didn’t have to do that. ” In what way? “He softened a bit, you know, to the degree that Harrison can soften. And we stayed together for the remainder of the film. It was never going to be more than that. I didn’t think it was going to be even that. ” While Ford was the number one thing on her mind throughout filming, she reckons she was probably around 15th on his list of priorities. She often sounds desolate in the journals. “I do not want to take part in my life,” she writes. “It can just go on without me. ” Was she suicidal? “No, I was never suicidal. I was just extremely insecure, especially around men. ” Yes, she says, there is a huge amount of pain there, but some of it is teenage angst and some of it was a reflection of her mental health. “I think some of that could have been being bipolar, though I hadn’t been diagnosed then. I had started going to therapy when I was 15. I realised something was a little too much with me. The doctor said, ‘Why are you here?’ and I said, ‘I want to stop crying so hard. ’” Looking back, she says, her feeling that Ford did not really care for her couldn’t have helped. “Certainly the situation didn’t make me feel that much better about myself. ” Again, she pauses. “But in a way it did. ” How? “Because he’d chosen me. ” Even now, she says, her feelings about that time are mixed. “I wouldn’t want to live through that again, ever. It’s just so obsessive, and   and confused. ” Was it one of the most intense experiences of her life? “I think so, because everything was exciting and new. We all became famous at that time, but there were other things to focus on, and certainly [the affair] was a formidable distraction. And maybe that made the fame less confusing, because it didn’t have all of my focus. ” Was he as good in bed as you’d expect Harrison Ford to be? Fisher gasps with faux shock. “Oh come on, I can’t answer that question! I was very infatuated with him. Look at him. Look at those pictures of him. Can you imagine what I thought, given what I thought of myself?” How does she feel, looking back at her teenage self now? “I felt sorry for myself, and I don’t like that at any age. ” She says she’s thankful that, at 60, she is not so lacking in  . I ask if her relationship with Ford shaped future relationships. “Freakishly, yes. ” How? “Well, I went with Paul after that, and Paul was not dissimilar. ” Fisher dated Paul Simon for six years, was married to him for 11 months, and then dated him again after they divorced. “Paul was much more verbal. But there was something very diffident again. He was the same amount older. I was 21 and Paul was 36. They were both very cerebral and serious. And they were witty, which is different from being funny. Funny, there’s a sort of pleading in it. Witty is a much more cerebral  . They both had that. And they’re both better after a couple of beers. ” She says there was one crucial difference in her relationship with Simon. “This time it was reciprocal, which was a huge relief. ” What astonishes me is that Fisher says she and Ford never discussed their relationship, neither at the time nor afterwards. “He’s not a big talker,” she says drily. “You know, he wasn’t Mr Chuckles. ” But what happened when they met on set for the sequels  —   The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi. Nothing, she says it was just their secret. “I think it was reabsorbed. You can see in our body language that we are comfortable with each other. ” Last year they were reunited as characters for the first time in 30 years, for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Surely by then they could talk about it? “No,” she says. “On this last film I noticed that two people were flirting and they had a big age difference like we had, and I pointed it out to him, and he said [she puts on his   deadpan] ‘Well, I hope it goes well for them.’ I think it’s the only time we’ve ever referred to it. ” Did he wink? “No. He’s not a wink person. ” What did emerge over the years, she thinks, was a lasting friendship. Recently, she told Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, about her affair with Ford. How did he react? “He was shocked. ” Does she still love Ford? “Yes, I love him. I’ll always feel something for him. I love Mark, too, but I love Mark more like a sibling. You can’t pretend something for so long without some of it coming true. ” For a long time, Fisher had been ambivalent about the Star Wars franchise. Yes, it had made her, but it had also stultified her  —   for many people, she will always be Princess Leia. Now, she is simply thankful. “It has been an enormous thing in my life. And it’s been the motor that’s run everything else. ” As for her current    life, she lives with her dog, Gary Fisher (who has his own Twitter account) is single, looking to move to Britain (particularly  ) and is more than ready for another man. “I want to find a British professor who will be able to put up with me, so you can put the word out. Good sense of humour, intelligent, not hideously unattractive, and sort of confident without being arrogant. ” I ask if she will be embarrassed next time she meets Ford. “Yeah, I’ll be embarrassed,” she says. How long for? “Not that long. I think it’s worth a flush or two!” She laughs. I tell her that, as she has been talking, I’ve been picturing that scene in The Empire Strikes Back, where Princess Leia finally professes her feelings to Han Solo. “I love you,” she says. “I know,” he replies. It feels so true to life, I say. “Yes,” she says, “I think that’s definitely informed by our relationship. It is much more me to say, ‘I love you’ and much more him to say the other. He improvised his bit. ”  I began filming Star Wars hoping to have an affair. Hoping to strike people as sophisticated and louche, someone you’d think had gone to boarding school in Switzerland with Anjelica Huston and had learned to speak four languages. Simon Templeman, a British boy with whom I had gone to drama school in London, had been my only boyfriend until then, and it had been a year before we slept together. That  —   along with some fooling around with three straight guys and kissing three gay guys  —   was basically the sum total of my earthling version of sexual experience. It’s difficult to imagine a childhood less likely to make one   than mine. My parents were known as America’s Sweethearts. The gorgeous couple with their two adorable little babies (my brother, Todd, came along 16 months after me) were the American Dream realised, until Eddie left Debbie for the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor, recently widowed and a friend of my mother’s. My first    lesson was what it felt like to be on the clueless end of infidelity. So when I was contemplating having an affair on this movie, I wasn’t going to include married guys. One of the things I knew when I met Harrison Ford was that nothing of a romantic nature would happen. He was also far too old for me  —   almost 15 years older! On top of that, there was something intimidating about him. His face in repose looked closer to a scowl than any other expression. He looked like he didn’t care whether or not you looked at him, so you watched him not caring, hungrily. I remember thinking, “This guy’s going to be a star. Not just a celebrity, a movie star. ” He looked like one of those types, like Humphrey Bogart. Some sort of epic energy hung around him, and he was so far out of my league. Compared with him, I didn’t even have a league. We were destined for different places. Was I bitter about this? Not so you’d notice. I was in the last year of my teens, only weeks free from my drama college romance and in my first starring role. I was extremely insecure. Oh, I could be witty as the deuce, but I had no idea how I should best apply that cleverness, for I was clever, not intellectual, having dropped out of high school to be a chorus girl in my mother’s Broadway show. Harrison made me feel nervous. I got   in his company, and clumsy. I was with him when we worked together and tried to avoid him otherwise, so as not to annoy him. It was more comfortable to hang out with the cast and crew, who were more fun and less immune to my charms. But when I look back with squinting eyes, I figure Harrison was scoping out the set in those early days. Not to have an affair, necessarily, but not not to, either. We were on location, after all, and a quiet jaunt on the side was almost expected. One Friday night after filming began, a party was organised to celebrate George Lucas’s 32nd birthday, in a room at Elstree Studios. Most of the crowd was made up of the crew: grips, electricians, drivers and all the others who toiled daily on the new, fairly obscure film that was being shot there. Not having located George yet, I tried to look as blase as possible as I sauntered barward, adding a smile to the mix to make it easier for the people there to like me and not wonder why I, of all people, had been cast as the rather daunting princess. “Hi! How you doing? Great to see you. ” What were their names, I wondered of these faces I saw every day. They all knew mine: it was on the call sheet. “Coke with ice, please? Oh, that’s right, we’re in England, there is no ice. OK, then, warm Coke it is. ” And then there was Harrison at the door. Wow, he looked thrilled to be there. It could happen, though, I thought. This could be the night he smiles. I waved as I brought my warm cola to my lips. Harrison raised his hand and began making his way through the group that was every minute growing larger  —   a social fungus, fed by the bar. “Hey, look who’s here,” I greeted someone. “No, I already have a drink. It does so pass for a drink. I can’t drink. I’ve tried. I’m allergic to booze. It makes me stupid, sick and unconscious really fast. ” Two members of the crew began making sport with me. “Look who we have here, boys! It’s our little princess without her buns!” Having the only girl at the party completely    drunk became one of the main focuses of the night  —   let’s get Leia legless  —   and if I played along, it would be the most idiotic choice I could make. We sang Happy Birthday, after which Harrison began a conversation with George. I was once again surrounded by musty,     men. They kept pushing me to have a drink, and finally the   in me took over. I asked for an amaretto, the only thing I drank. It tastes like cough syrup, but at least it would be familiar. I looked at the glass the crew member handed me. Instead of amaretto, it was wine. I frowned. “Sorry,” he said, “they didn’t have your fancy drink. This should do what amaretto does, better. ” My face went into a   grimace after my first swig of the foul stuff. And another swig, and another. I couldn’t focus on the taste for long, because there I was laughing, like those adults I watched at my mother’s parties when I was a kid. I don’t know when I became aware that the crew were organising a kind of joke abduction of me. A jovial plan to take me to wherever movie crews take young actors when they want to establish that she belongs to them, at least for the moment. Certainly it wasn’t a serious thing. What made it look serious was how big the men tended to be. At some point, I realised my head was hurting. “You need to get some air,” one of the crew said. “Hey,” a new voice, American, not British, called out. “Where are you taking her?” “Nowhere, man, the lady just wants a little air. ” “Pardon me, but the lady doesn’t seem to be very aware of what she wants. ” Harrison! What was he saying? I didn’t know what I wanted? When did he become the expert? “Harrison!” I greeted him. “Where’ve you been?” He was suddenly making a great show of saving me from what I can only guess at. The crew pulled, Harrison pushed back, I tried to stay in focus. A    involving my   virtue was under way, and I was unclear how it would turn out  —   but I realised who it was I wanted to win: my   the one with the scar on his chin, the dialogue in his head and the gun in his belt  —   not now, just when in character, but still. After a mad scuffle, Mr Ford threw my virtue and me into the back seat of his studio car and commanded the driver to “Go! GO!” We went, followed by the crew. About halfway to London from Elstree, I heard the honking of a horn. I pushed Harrison’s shoulder back. “What’s that?” I asked, panicked. “Shit,” Harrison mumbled, squinting out of the back window over my head. “It’s Mark and Peter. ” “Oh my God. ” I started to sit up, but he stopped me: “Fix your hair. ” My hair  —   it was always my hair with this movie,   or off. I stayed slunk down while I did my unlevel best to straighten my hair, then slowly rose. “Just act normal,” Harrison suggested. A blue car caught up with us. One of the crew, Peter Kohn, was driving, with a beautiful girl, the actor Koo Stark, to his left and Mark [Hamill] in the back. He waved and smiled. I waved back. The fact that Harrison and I had rolled around in the back seat during our return to London didn’t necessarily mean that it was a prologue for a more elaborate event. Sure, there had been some unexpected exploratory kissing. But otherwise  …     Then somehow we were having dinner with Mark, Peter and Koo (whose work in Star Wars ended up on the cutting room floor) in London. Most of my thoughts centred on how much prettier Koo was than me, how confident she seemed. Harrison was on his   way to being pretty much everything to me. He would all too soon become the centre of my   world. I don’t recall much about that dinner except how   I was, how awkward and fuzzy from the alcohol. Seated at our table, I figured it would be all right to look at Harrison when and if he said something, but my hair could grow if I waited for that unlikely event, right? Wrong. He talked more than I’d ever seen him talk. There were stories about the day we’d had an early call  —   hardly unusual  —   and by early afternoon still hadn’t been summoned to the set. “It doesn’t bother me to be kept waiting,” Mark volunteered. “There are ways to keep yourself entertained. ” “Oh, yeah?” Mr Ford drawled. “What ways? Catching up on correspondence or taking up the zither?” I listened intently: everything depended on my getting into this conversation, while trying to convey that it didn’t matter to me at all. “I would pay many   dollars to see you play the zither,” I offered shyly, hyperaware of making a good impression. Harrison studied me briefly from across the table. Narrowing his hazel eyes, he said, “How much?” He waited for my reply knowingly he wasn’t smiling, but he wasn’t not smiling, either. Under the table, I picked at my thumb. What were we talking about? Why was he looking at me like that? “How much for what?” I asked them sadly. “I’m a little lost?” Now I sounded as if I was pleading. They laughed. Harrison didn’t laugh, but he looked as though he might have if he’d been made a different way. Then I remembered. “Play the zither! I’m going to pay you to play the zither!” “Now?” Harrison said. “Yes!” We all laughed. Maybe everything would be all right now. I was going to go home with Harrison. I knew it wasn’t a good idea. It would never be a good idea, but it wouldn’t be a really bad one either. I mean, weird and grumpy as he might have been, he wasn’t a bad human. We stood under the timid light of a street lamp outside the restaurant. Harrison flicked away his Camel and looked at me: “I can drop you at your place  —   it’s on my way. ” He took my arm and drew me into the back of a taxi, moving us closer and closer until we were two faces, four eyes, one kiss, going to the place where we could rehearse that kissing we would be doing a year and a half later in The Empire Strikes Back. These were the early days and nights of the Force. It’s difficult to recall details from that weekend. Even if I could, what are we talking about here, soft porn for hardened   fans? All I can remember, after he followed me in and turned on the hallway light, was that I meant to show him around my little flat, only now our fumbling was not in a moving vehicle, driven by a knowing spectator. A tiny part of me felt like I’d won the man lottery and here I was both counting and spending the money. I looked over at Harrison. He was  …     God, he was just so handsome. No, more than that. He looked like he could lead the charge into battle, take the hill, win the duel, be leader of the   world, all without breaking a sweat. So how could you ask such a shining specimen of a man to be satisfied with the likes of me? No! Don’t tell me! The fact is that he was! Even if it was for a short while. That was way more than enough. Harrison fell asleep and I tried to. I forgave him for not loving me in the way one expects  —   and almost forgave myself for not expecting it. I breathed with him there in the dark  —   wondering what he was dreaming and hoping I would wake up before he did. Maybe I’d be better at talking with him now  —   less daunted, in character and out. I wasn’t good at being clear about anything that I wanted with Harrison. I could charm the birds out of everyone’s trees but his. Instead, I wrote in the diaries I kept during filming. There were two reasons I wrote them: I’d always written, since I was 12 and I couldn’t talk to Harrison. Basically about anything, but especially about the entity that was “us”. And given my time with him was a secret, I couldn’t confide in anyone else. There are some things I still consider private. Amazing, isn’t it? But sex is private. So I put the kibosh on sharing what occurred between Mr Ford and me on that fateful Friday night in May 1976, and on subsequent Fridays at ungodly hours. I didn’t know how I would live through the five whole days of filming following that first weekend. Those five days went unbearably slowly, with our having to behave towards each other as though the weekend before hadn’t even occurred. All through the week, I waited in vain for some indication that (a) we had ever been together (or had I imagined the entire event?)   (b) if it had occurred, would it ever occur again in any form, ranging from another inarticulate weekend to finally marrying (after a discreet amount of time had elapsed since his eventual, uncomplicated divorce). I’m sure on our relative lists of priorities, I might have ranked as high as number 15 on his agenda, while Harrison was my number one. But spend a second weekend we did. Once again, we were together in our apart way. We met at the North Star pub in St John’s Wood, between Elstree and central London. I held my breath quite a bit  —   a lot  —   while fretting over what I would and would not say that evening. I would be calm and succinct, ask thoughtful questions and listen to his answers. He would wonder where I had been all his life. In fact, what happened was Harrison and I both began to drink and at some point early on I said, “Do you want to see me do an imitation of you?” Harrison didn’t walk, he swaggered, like John Wayne in slow motion  —   taking his seemingly bad attitude for a walk. To depict this, I moved out of sight and after a moment reappeared, strolling as he strolled, sauntering my way into whatever fresh hell I found myself. I’d become him, disenchanted Lord Ford, master of all he surveyed. I hadn’t looked at Harrison yet to see how my portrayal of him was going over  —   too busy appearing indifferent and impatient with my surroundings. As I continued to portray his inner monologue, I finally let at least one of my eyes slide wearily to his face and saw that he was not only laughing, he was laughing that silent and hard laugh reserved for true enthusiasm. Almost 40 years later, I still think of it as one of the greater moments of my life. If my portrait of my   as a smug,   nerf herder went well enough, Harrison could unexpectedly (but gently and responsibly) leave his wife and marry me (in an unsentimental, tasteful way) and we would subsequently astonish everyone  —   including ourselves  —   by remaining together for the rest of whoever died first’s life. And all because I dared to do an imitation of him, for him, in the pub one night! That was the beginning of his realising that I was the only person with whom he felt comfortable enough to be, well, still uncomfortable, but now at peace with finding the world a constant disappointment. This was the first time I felt as though Harrison liked me. Not because he wanted to sleep with me, or no one else was around. He liked me. I’d made him laugh. We sat smiling at each other, each waiting for the other to  —   what? Say something! “I do other imitations,” I finally offered. “Judy Garland for one, but you wouldn’t like it  —   it’s pretty loud and includes dancing and a lot of makeup. ” He nodded. “Any more quiet ones? Like mine?” I thought for a moment, searching for a funny reply. What to say? Oh, please make him like me! Then everything will be fine, or thereabouts. But no punchlines came to deliver that body blow that would reignite the blaze of his smile. He hates me now, and thinks I’m boring and stupid. “I could do an imitation of my college boyfriend. He was  . ” Harrison raised his eyebrows slightly. “Oh?” “Yeah, well, maybe all boyfriends are quiet. ” Not boyfriends! Harrison wasn’t my boyfriend and would never be. Fix this! “Well, I wouldn’t know about all boyfriends,” I rattled on. “Simon’s the first boyfriend I ever had. And I don’t really  —   I’m not actually looking to  …    ” Harrison’s face had whitened suddenly. “What do you mean, your only boyfriend?” I blinked. What had I done now? I struggled for something to say. “What about all those guys you talked about?” he said. “Rob, the photographer, and Fred and Buck  …    ” Still frowning, I said, “Fred? I didn’t sleep with him, I know him. Hey, you know him, too! Does that mean you slept with him? I don’t sleep with all the men I know. Christ, if you thought that I slept with every man who found himself in some story of mine, you must think I’m like a hooker or something! A slut! So I guess that made it all right for you!” “Made what all right?” “To fuck hookers! Your big, slutty    …     Me!” He interrupted, “All right! Enough!” “Fine,” I said, sulking, “but you shut up also. ” (A version of that happened. A   version, with fewer words and a lot less volume.) Harrison was looking at the floor, blinking. Why was he so upset? I thought men liked it if you were inexperienced. Or was that only in Victorian times? It didn’t occur to me until decades later that perhaps what disturbed him was the implication that he was subsequently burdened with something very like responsibility, in that he had somehow been given a gift he hadn’t wanted or expected. How can I paint for you the picture of this brief break in the bad weather of no feeling? Sadly, I cannot because of the memory loss that comes with marijuana use. The   ingestion of Harrison’s preferred strain of pot took whatever certainty I possessed while in his company and traded it for paranoia so intense, it took my breath away. What I recall from the rubble of my brain cells is my discomfort between waking and sleeping, trying to think of something to say other than, “Do you love me?” or, “Why are you with me?” Though there has been speculation regarding my drug use during Star Wars, I used nothing other than Harrison’s pot on the weekends during that first film, and have never used marijuana again. Harrison finished shooting first. My last scenes would be two weeks later, so I decided to go back to LA for a break, and we wound up flying there together. I don’t know if he was pleased with these arrangements, because he didn’t exhibit emotions and I didn’t record it in my journals, but we did wind up talking. I do remember that he was kind. Kind enough to enable me to close the door on our   episode together without regret. Which was quite a turn of events, when you consider all those silent weekends. “I’m a hick,” I recall saying to him. “No,” he answered. “You think you’re less than you are. You’re a smart hick. ” And then, “You have the eyes of a doe and the balls of a samurai. ” It’s the only thing he ever said to me that acknowledged any intimacy between us, and it was enough. Not only because it had to be, but because of what I’m assuming it cost him to go that out of character in conversation. We never again acknowledged that anything of that nature had occurred. • This is an edited extract from The Princess Diarist, by Carrie Fisher, published next week by Transworld priced £16. 99.

"So Andy Murray is still the Olympic champion. That’s all from me tonight. Thanks for reading and emailing. Night! Andy Murray manages to remember all the words of the national anthem, singing along as it blares around Centre Court. Then the three of them come together for a group photo. Murray manages another awkward grin. He’s so very . .. Murray. But gold goes to Great Britain’s Andy Murray. Four years after beating Roger Federer in London, he’s done it again, defeating Del Potro in an epic final. He just about manages a smile. A huge ovation for Juan Martin del Potro as he collects his silver medal. Even the Brazilians are showing their appreciation for him now. He’s smiling now. Can you blame him? He almost gave this sport up. Kei Nishikori is the first to collect his bronze medal. Remember, he’s the first Japanese player to win an Olympic tennis medal since 1920. It’s time for the victory ceremony. Andy Murray strides out first and he’s followed by silver medalist Juan Martin del Potro and bronze medalist Kei Nishikori, who beat Rafa Nadal earlier. The Argentinian fans are still chanting Del Potro’s name. Heather Watson and her mother were also watching. Andy Murray should hang his head in shame. Look what he’s put his poor mother through. Del Potro picks up his bags and waves to the crowd. Even the Brazilian fans are saluting him. It’s all too much. His eyes are very red. “Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Delpo! Delpo!” That chant from the crowd just about sums it up. The big man has to settle for silver but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation as he returns to his chair and looks at the ground with tears in his eyes. So for the first time in this match, which has been going on for All Eternity, Del Potro is serving to stay in this remarkable Olympic final. So he might as well go hell for leather on the first point. He wheels into that forehand and grinds Murray down to lead  . Murray wins the next point, doing just about enough with an overhead, but then he swipes a forehand return wide for  . But then it’s Del Potro’s turn to fail with a forehand, the game going to  . Murray looks like he’s about to win the next point when Del Potro drops a ball short. Yet he seems put off when some clown shouts out from the crowd and he totally messes up his drop shot. He stares at the crowd. If looks could kill. It’s  . But not for long. Del Potro is dragged to deuce when he misses a backhand. The volume’s increasing and, just to add to the drama, an Argentinian fan is being ejected. Appropriately enough, he’s wearing a jester hat. Eventually he’s sent on his way, boos ringing around the arena as he leaves, and play can continue. When it does, Del Potro wallops a forehand wide. It would have been a winner. But wide it went and Murray has his first gold medal point! Can he take it? No! He nets a tight forehand return for deuce! But he has another chance when Del Potro, unnerved by a fine return, nets a backhand slice. Is this the moment? It is! Del Potro puts everything into a series of huge forehands. But he’s looking so tired. And this time he’s not kidding around. He’s dropping them short and Murray’s in the rally. He seizes control with a forehand into the left corner and Del Potro, on his last legs, can only slice into the net! That’s it! It’s all over! Andy Murray is the Olympic champion again! He’s in tears! Of course he is. He loves a good cry. And why not? No one’s ever won back to back Olympic titles in the tennis before! Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): Simple analysis about what Murray needs to do here: STOP DOING DOUBLE FAULTS. He heeds my advice. Yet it doesn’t matter when Del Potro pops a forehand down the line to lead  . It’s happening again, isn’t it. Yep. It’s   when Del Potro swings at a forehand off a second serve, forcing Murray to miss a backhand. Murray looks exasperated. Then it’s Del Potro’s turn to hold his head in his hands. A forehand’s called long. The umpire overrules it. Murray challenges. It was in! They’ll have to replay the point and Murray, who’s out of challenges, has a first serve. He wins the point at the net to make it  . But he’s not out of the woods yet, far from it, especially when Del Potro sees a fine Murray approach and punches a wondrous backhand down the line out of nowhere to bring up two break points. I doubt Murray wants to see his serving stats from this set. They must make for grim reading. Yet just when you think it’s done, you forget that this is Andy Murray’s world and nothing ever makes sense. Del Potro squanders the first break point with a netted backhand. Murray saves the second with an ace. But of course. Barely able to make a serve throughout the set, then he does that. Another ace brings up game point and Murray holds when Del Potro nets a backhand. He’s a game away from the gold medal. Mind you, I quite want to see how ridiculous a   between these two would be. Fourth set: Murray         Del Potro* (*denotes server): Serving to force an unlikely fifth set, Del Potro throws everything at Murray. But it’s superb defence from Murray, who wins the point when Del Potro gets jittery with a forehand for  . Murray’s got another   lead when Del Potro nets a backhand slice. He looks tired. Then again, he always looks tired. He could sleep for a year and emerge looking tired. Part of the charm. He looks even more knackered after winning the next point with an overhead for  . Yet Murray earns two break points, hurting Del Potro with a splendid backhand down the line. Del Potro’s response? He saves the first with a preposterous forehand drop shot. Even Murray’s not making that one. He can live with that. He can’t abide what he does with the second break point, though, needlessly netting a backhand. He’s happier after the next point, a stunning, seesawing rally that ends with Del Potro blocking a forehand wide after Murray goes for a backhand down the line. Here comes a third break point. Here comes a huge serve. Here’s deuce. But Murray carves out a fourth opportunity. He drop shots and although Del Potro gets there, he rams a forehand past him. And the pressure tells. Murray’s pumping his fist after Del Potro nets a backhand! He’s broken back! Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): Murray regains some poise on serve, an ace down the middle making it  . He probably should have done that 10 minutes ago.

Fourth set: Murray         Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro’s yet to consolidate a break in this set. Is it to be third time lucky? His prospects aren’t looking too clever when he nets a slice to drop the first point before spooning a forehand long for  . Del Potro grits his teeth. He wins the next two points.  . Then Murray nets a forehand return. It’s  . And Del Potro holds thanks to a fantastic volley! What courage he’s showing here. Murray has to serve to stay in the fourth set. But. Well. “We really have been cheated by the Tennis Gods,” says Adam Hirst. “This is an excellent   a really good and interesting game, as it would have been for Del Potro against any of the other three these last 6 years. Both players play well from the baseline but there is enough at the net from both to keep things interesting as well. Cracking stuff. ” Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): The Del Potro forehand’s firing again! Murray needs to watch out. It’s  . But there’s not a lot anyone can do when he hits that shot with this much venom. Murray accepts it, gets on with it and wins the next point with a drop shot and a sharp volley for  . Mind you, Del Potro looks surprisingly sprightly all of a sudden and he’s got a   lead after another   from Murray, who wastes his second challenge of this set. He’s only got one left and he’s screaming at himself. He’s even more infuriated after netting a forehand, conceding two more break points. Murray’s serve has gone to pot again. He draws Del Potro forward. But the Argentinian’s all over this drop shot. Murray tries a backhand lob but it’s nowhere near good enough and Del Potro breaks again with a smash! What’s up with Murray’s concentration? Fourth set: Murray         Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro helped himself to a quick thigh rub during the changeover there. It seems to have had an effect judging by the way he crushes a forehand down the line for  . Another forehand winner makes it  . A third makes it  . A fourth sees him hold to love. Blimey! Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): It’s about time someone held in this set, about time Murray stopped handing out presents. He stunk the place out with both of his previous service games. But this time he wins the first point, forcing Del Potro to volley long. An ace down the middle makes it  . But Del Potro still has some firepower left, ripping a forehand away to make it  . That’s a warning shot, one Murray won’t want to ignore. Yet he’s rediscovered his consistency. He holds to 15. It’s the first hold of the set. And Del Potro hasn’t won a service game for a while. Fourth set: Murray         Del Potro* (*denotes server): A long, tense rally ends with Del Potro wincing as he clips a forehand wide for  . Now he’s struggling to locate his first serve. Bad news against Murray, who’s soon got a   lead, Del Potro netting a backhand. The next rally ends with Del Potro slicing long. He holds his left thigh. He grimaces. Murray has three break points. The first goes begging, a forehand going wide. But the low, spinning slice down the line does the trick. Del Potro stoops and nets a forehand. He looks knackered. But appearances can be deceiving.  Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): Murray’s serving has been pretty iffy at times tonight and he begins this game with his fourth   to gift Del Potro a   lead. Then he splutters a forehand into the net and that’s  . But Murray hauls himself back to  . Del Potro misses a backhand return for   before Murray finds the line with a backhand winner. Yet Del Potro’s clutching a break point after a second   from Murray. World No2, you say? This is preposterous. So’s the next rally. Murray tries to pass with a backhand from left to right. Del Potro digs it out from under his feet. Somehow. Murray manages to scoop it up but can only tee it up for Del Potro to plonk the ball back into the open court. Very strange from Murray. Del Potro edges ahead again. Fourth set: Murray         Del Potro* (*denotes server): Gifted that break by Murray, Del Potro begins this game with an ace down the middle. Murray’s promptly given a warning for an audible obscenity. It’s no surprise he’s infuriated after that stinker of a service game. That spot of swearing seems to rouse him, though. Del Potro sticks a volley into the net to make it   and Murray makes it   with a well judged backhand that draws an error from his opponent. A good, deep second serve from Del Potro gets him back to   but Murray has a break point after returning well with a forehand. He chucks it away, though, putting too much into an attempted forehand winner, the ball dropping just wide. Then comes a discussion between Del Potro and the umpire. It’s not clear what’s going on but they’re friends in the end. On they go. And Murray earns a second break point, a backhand down the line too much for Del Potro, who can’t do anything with a volley. What now? Murray genius, that’s what. An absurd, teasing backhand drop shot, beautifully weighted, taunting Del Potro, slapping him in the face. What a shot. Murray breaks back. Fourth set: Murray*         Del Potro (*denotes server): Del Potro changes rackets, jogs to the baseline and wipes his weary face with a towel. His task looks forlorn as he takes up his position behind the baseline, ready to return, but it’s Murray who makes a dodgy start to the fourth set, losing the first two points with a couple of howlers, missing an easy overhead by miles, then dumping a forehand wide. He doesn’t need to give Del Potro any encouragement. But he’s going through a dip, netting a forehand to hand over two break points. This is appalling from Murray. Utter tosh. He butches another forehand, sending it way past the baseline, to drop his serve. Dearie me, that was awful. Del Potro didn’t have to do a thing. Looking to stay in the third set, Del Potro loses the first two points with errant groundstrokes. Another mistake and Murray has three set points. He can’t take the first, dragging a backhand wide. So he takes the second, swiping a forehand return from right to left, as though it was the easiest thing in the world. He’s a set away from retaining Olympic gold. That ran away from Del Potro very quickly.  Third set: Murray*       Del Potro (*denotes server): The errors are creeping into Del Potro’s game at the moment and it’s not long before Murray leads  .

Murray has another chance when Del Potro dips a hopeful slice wide, though, and this time he takes it when the Argentinian batters a forehand long. “Come on!” Murray wells, leaping for good measure.

His answer was resounding. But it’s fair to ask the question again. How much has he got left in the tank? Because that was a monumental effort. For the sake of entertainment, you’ve got to hope that he’s not run out of juice. For Andy Murray’s sake, you’ve got to hope he’s feeling it a bit. Murray certainly has the legs for a  .

Murray targets the Del Potro backhand and races to the net, not counting on the big Argentinian walloping a stonking pass down the line!

Murray’s level has dipped a little here and his first double fault hands Del Potro a break point. Can he take it? He can! Murray nets a backhand to concede a sloppy game and Del Potro is back in this! “Shhh, don’t tell anyone, but I am 100% with McMahon,” says Matt Dony. “Murray doesn’t really have much to prove, but    Olympic titles really would be something special. It’s hard to believe that, outside people who follow tennis, he still appears to be underrated. My mum, for one, is still convinced he’s just another plucky loser who gets lucky from time to time. He’ll no doubt go down in history as a great player. And another gold for britain’s   tally would be welcome. And yet, Del Potro has quietly become one of the most popular athletes at the games, and for good reason. This is just about as much of a ‘ ’ situation as I can imagine. At the end of the match, whichever way it goes, I’m going to be happy. ”"

"There was no such thing as Classic Rock in 1976  —   the phrase, and the radio format it inspired, wouldn’t come into common usage until the  . But there was already some notion of a rock and roll canon, a list of key albums that FM listeners needed to have in their collection. At the start of 1976, Bob Seger had zero albums on that list. Twelve months later, he had two: Live Bullet, the double LP documenting some blistering hometown sets at Detroit’s Cobo Hall, and Night Moves, his first platinum album, whose title single would peak at No. 4 as 1977 began. His next record, 1978’s Stranger in Town, would go platinum within a month. I bought all three at once that year, because they were the ones Columbia House offered. But I knew there were others. As a budding,    music obsessive, every record in the canon triggered a cascading need for several more. Some might be content with Elton John’s Greatest Hits, but I wanted the entirety of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and then some way to prioritize the rest of his back catalog. Destroyer was not enough KISS At Budokan was not the sum total of Cheap Trick. But there were always more records than money to buy them with, even if you stocked your initial collection with 13 titles for the mere penny Columbia House demanded. So every few weeks, when I’d scrounged together $10, I’d flip through the stacks in my local record store, starting at A (Aerosmith’s Toys in the Attic was the must have, then the   debut, which had ”Dream On,” but was Get Your Wings worth the $4. 95?) and ending at Y (so many Neil Young albums besides Harvest) trying to decide which one or two LPs were the next to be added to my shelves. I spent a lot of time lingering in the S bin, studying Seger’s back catalog as well as that of another rock and roll true believer: Bruce Springsteen. Both were all over the radio with songs that sounded a lot simpler than they really were, and tackled similar subjects  —   humble roots, wanting to escape, fearing your chance had passed  —   in similar ways, transforming the RB singers who’d inspired them into something a little less groovy, a lot more driving and therefore more immediately digestible for white suburban kids. Bruce only had four LPs then, whereas Bob seemed to have a new old one every time I returned to the S rack: Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man, Mongrel, Back in ’72, Smokin’ O. P.’s, Seven, Beautiful Loser. They weren’t all there every time (though I didn’t know it then, two others, Noah and Brand New Morning, had already fallen out of print) so it was hard to tell whether one going missing meant it was a good one I should have grabbed when I had the chance, or simply wasn’t worth restocking because so few people wanted it. It had taken Seger a decade of false starts to secure his place in the canon, and the very size of his back catalog and the way the band name kept changing  —   from The Bob Seger System to plain old Bob Seger to Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band  —   implied it had taken him a while to figure out what he was doing. Most visits, I slipped the Seger records back in the bin and went home with something else, though I congratulate my younger self for eventually gambling on Back in ’72 and Smokin’ O. P.’s. In those   days, we relied on magazines such as Rolling Stone and Creem to fill us in on artists’ back stories, and every new piece about a given performer came with an obligatory summary of their career to date. Reading these all in a row in 2017 can be grimly amusing, as it’s clear Seger was   by the cognoscenti from his very first   single (1966’s ”East Side Story,” credited to Bob Seger and the Last Heard, recorded at the behest of manager Eddie ”Punch” Andrews, who still oversees Seger’s affairs today). But writers greeted every new release with some variation of ”Bob is great hopefully this record will put him over the top.” As the years went by, each new review then felt obliged to explain why the last LP hadn’t done so after all. Here’s a small sample of that pattern, all taken from back issues of Rolling Stone:    Ben Edmonds, reviewing Mongrel”It’s easily his best overall work to date, but there are still some crucial musical problems he must come to grips with if he is to realize the tremendous potential he displayed on his earlier   singles . .. why recognition has been so long in coming to one so obviously talented is beyond me.”    Jon Landau, reviewing Back in ’72”. ..ironically, it seems to me to have a better shot at commercial success than any of its more calculated predecessors . .. he belongs at the very top of the rock  roll heap. Back in ’72 is just the record to put him there.”    Dave Marsh, reviewing Seven”Bob Seger has been touted for years as a   John Fogerty but has never had the monster hit needed to break out nationally . .. what he really needs is a good producer.”    Ken Barnes, reviewing Beautiful Loser”Bob Seger is a superb songwriter and Midwestern rocker who’s been ignored for far too long . ... With this LP, he deserves his long delayed recognition  —   now.”    Dave Marsh again, reviewing Live Bullet”. ..because of poor recording, lack of record company support and what has at times seemed like willful career mismanagement . .. Seger remains anonymous . .. he still has not been properly produced.” By 1976, Marsh was not the only observer blaming Seger’s inability to become a household name on odd management choices. In a small Rolling Stone feature that year headlined, ”A Star in His Own State,” Patrick Goldstein repeated the mantra that ”Seger’s lack of national prominence is viewed as something of a mystery,” ascribed some of the responsibility to Andrews’ ”  decision to release Seger’s string of Warners albums on his own label, Palladium,” then quoted ”a local publicist” who expressed frustration with Punch Management: ”’They just seem to reflect his attitudes . ... They’ve got to convince him to tour the coasts more often if he really wants to break nationally. ’” But the surprise success of Live Bullet, Seger’s ninth album, quickly silenced such sniping. Despite Marsh’s quibbling about production, Bullet gained Seger the national audience all those writers had been sure he deserved. Like most of Seger’s other recordings, which could reliably sell 10, 000 to 50, 000 copies in Michigan and Ohio, if nowhere else, Bullet began as a regional hit, selling its first 300, 000 copies in Detroit before finally getting Seger spun elsewhere in the country. Maybe he could have toured the coasts more often, but regular airplay in Los Angeles and New York quickly accomplished the same thing: He was no longer just a local hero. It’s tempting now to draw a line in Seger’s career: a variety of noble commercial and artistic misfires prior to Live Bullet, then a string of increasingly successful exhibitions of his craft thereafter. But all the ingredients that made the albums after Live Bullet sell millions were present from the beginning. There’s an amiable haphazardness to Seger’s first seven or eight records (and the  ’60s singles that preceded them) which saw Seger adopting then discarding a variety of different approaches, from the   psychedelic rocker heard on his earliest hit, 1968’s ”Ramblin’ Gamblin’ Man,” to acoustic   to   purveyor of slightly sanitized Stones riffs. But what might have come off as cynical careerism in another artist just felt like a true fan’s promiscuousness with Seger. He’d inhaled rock and roll’s history with an acolyte’s belief in its redemptive power and a gifted composer’s ability to intuit the specific elements that made certain songs work. He was a human radio antenna, with a conviction so genuine and a melodic skill so great that he could turn the most basic elements  —   Chuck Berry leads plus Ike  Tina howls on the rockers restrained but steadily building arrangements from the Muscle Shoals rhythm section on the ballads  —   into perfectly realized creations that leapt straight from the speakers into your soul, bypassing your brain entirely. The gold record he earned with Bullet simply gave him a sorely needed combination of confidence, clout and cash. He promptly spent all three realizing a vision one could only catch glimpses of in his previous recordings, like 1970’s cover of ”River Deep, Mountain High,” an early display of his agility at translating RB into hard rock. ”Turn the Page,” from 1972, is the original brooding,   power ballad. Both now sound like templates for multiple   Seger would have later that decade. He’d been called   (as a compliment) in 1973 and was referred to (with zero irony) as punk in 1977. These are not contradictions  —   in 1977, punk was   musically, an effort to strip away every extraneous filigree that had accreted like barnacles on the hull of rock music. Bob Seger was basic, when basicness was a good thing the world lacked. The main thing that distinguishes the albums from ’76 on is just how much better he got at distilling his various inspirations. Spending more time in better studios with more accomplished producers certainly helped, but so did the fact that Bullet, which was nothing but live versions of the most fully realized songs from his first eight records, had already proven there was a wider audience for Seger’s particular mélange. 1980’s Against the Wind continued Seger’s platinum streak, and savvy licensing deals extended Seger’s presence far beyond radio and record stores. The iconic scene in Risky Business where Tom Cruise lets the audience know just how liberating having your parent’s mansion to yourself can be by   Seger’s ”Old Time Rock  Roll” while dancing around in his underwear rocketed the movie, the star and the song into the broader pop cultural firmament. In 1991, Chevrolet’s use of ”Like a Rock” to advertise their trucks proved so powerful that the campaign, which was planned to last three to six months, ran for 13 years. Fast forward to this decade. I hear someone singing ”If I Were a Carpenter,” which reminds me Seger did a surprisingly heavy version of that song on Smokin’ O. P.’s, which I haven’t heard for a while. I reach for my copy, only to find that it’s gone. This is bothersome, but correctable, I imagine. I am a gainfully employed adult, living in a city with multiple wonderful used record stores, plus there’s an entire Internet at my fingertips. I decide to go on a spree, replacing not just the missing album, but finally adding the several I never purchased to my collection.  But I discover something odd: Bob Seger’s old albums are not only missing from my shelves. They seem to be missing from the world. Seger is one of the few remaining digital holdouts  —   there’s nothing beyond the odd Christmas tune available on subscription services, and even on iTunes his only studio album for sale is 2014’s Ride Out, which sits beside two anthologies and two live albums. (Disclosure: I already knew this. As a content executive at Rhapsody and, later, Google Play, I have been involved in at least two attempts to convince his label and management to make his catalog available on demand. This entire article can maybe be read as my third attempt, though I’m no longer in a position to benefit professionally from such a development. The benefits to me as a fan are hopefully obvious. The benefits to Seger as an artist, I will argue, are incalculable.) But this is not merely a case of   being cautious about digital distribution, because most of his studio albums are no longer in print physically, either. Out of 17 total, his own website shows only six available for purchase: his ’75 through ’80 run of Beautiful Loser, Night Moves, Stranger in Town and Against the Wind, plus this century’s Face The Promise and Ride Out. Used copies of his first seven albums start around $30, and go as high as $200, if you can even find one. Those   prices suggest I made several wrong calls back in 1978. They also convince me I know who took my copy of Smokin’ OP’s  —   a former housemate who worked in a record store, and was apparently savvier than I about its slowly increasing value. Copies of ’80s and ’90s albums The Distance, Like a Rock, The Fire Inside and It’s a Mystery are a bit easier to locate, and accordingly more affordable, but also, officially, out of print. Simply stated, this is a bizarre state of affairs. Catalog sales (traditionally defined as anything not released in the past 18 months) have always represented a huge chunk of record industry revenue, and catalog’s percentage of total revenue has been increasing steadily for a decade  —   according to Nielsen Music, catalog accounted for 37% of all sales in 2005, had risen to 49% of all sales by 2014 and surpassed new releases to represent the majority of all sales for the first time in 2015. That same year, Nielsen reported that catalog represented nearly 70% of plays on streaming services. Labels take those percentages so seriously they have entire divisions devoted to back catalog. As Adam Block, President of Sony Music’s Legacy Recordings, explains, ”Legacy exists to make sure the stories that are our artists, their albums, their songs, get told and  . If they’re not, they’ll drift off into the great digital void we’re standing on the precipice of.” Such efforts are not just a canny way to get existing fans to repurchase records they already own. As Bruce Resnikoff, CEO of UMe, says, ”Generally speaking, if your first fan and your last fan are the same, then you have failed to grow your artist’s audience.” UMe’s strategy with back catalog bears that out: Resnikoff describes super deluxe editions ”geared towards the longtime, core fan base (with) demos, outtakes and rare materials as well as the full essays and photos all housed in a collector’s box,” and explains why he offers those in tandem with ”an introduction edition for a new fan. It is a delicate balance to be true to the existing fans, while creating releases that reach new fans who are consuming and discovering music through new platforms.” Seger’s absence from digital services, combined with the gradual disappearance of even physical copies of half his catalog, suggest a rare level of indifference to his legacy. I can’t think of any other artist of his stature, with such a string of   hits, who’s been content to let his past work fade away in this manner. Contemporaries from the ’70s and ’80s regularly issue 25th anniversary editions of old LPs while basking in critical   of their early work. Bruce Springsteen, the other artist I lingered over in those S bins in the 1970s, has embraced this reality. A significant chunk of fans who bought all his albums on vinyl as teenagers have since added anniversary editions (with tempting bonus CDs of outtakes and   documentaries on DVD) of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and The River. But with Seger, all you hear is crickets. It’s 2017, but for some reason it’s easier for casual music fans to start playing deep cuts by Bing Crosby, who had a No. 1 record in 1940, than most anything by Bob Seger, who had a No. 1 record in 1980. Seger declined to comment for this article, but we know for sure he has a dim view of portions of his catalog. As he told an interviewer in 2007, ”There’s a bunch of songs on Back In ’72 that are bums. People keep saying: ’I want to hear that album.’ And I go: ’No, that’s okay. ’” We also know that, whatever Seger’s thoughts about online music might be, he lets Punch Andrews make all the business calls, as he explained to the Wall Street Journal years ago: ”I do music, he does business. It’s a great division of labor and we don’t get into each other’s areas.” He said much the same to Rolling Stone’s Andy Greene in 2014: ”It’s an ongoing issue with my manager and Capitol Records . .. I’ve had the same manager for 49 years and he’s been right most of the time.” The dispute with Capitol seems to revolve around what percentage of any online royalties Capitol is obligated to pay Seger, though reading through the many pages of testimony Punch and Gear Publishing, which has handled Seger’s publishing for the past 50 years, submitted to the Copyright Office in 2011 and 2014 concerning various rate setting procedures, Punch is equally skeptical about the benefits online services offer his client. Asked via email what needs to change before more of Seger’s catalog comes online, Andrews replied, ”For years, we have been asked to bring the catalog to streaming. We have not pulled the trigger there because the rates are low so low, in fact, that the label would not break it down and show the artist how little he would make. Bob has always been an album artist and that format has served him very well. Streaming and downloads have always favored singles artists.” Punch’s opinion on going digital can be boiled down to: ”Not yet in the artist’s interest.” And Seger’s take is essentially: ”Punch is usually right.” But there’s a lot of space in that ”usually.” Punch has had the last laugh when others were convinced he was woefully misguided before. Who should be smirking this time round? Is Seger doing better or worse in 2017 than he should be? We can use some straightforward methods to check. Let’s start with record sales. Reliable figures prior to the introduction of Nielsen Music’s Soundscan in 1992 can be hard to come by, and RIAA gold and platinum certifications are notoriously suspect (Nielsen Music consistently reports lower numbers for titles the RIAA has certified as   platinum albums on a particular date) but we know that all nine Bob Seger albums from 1975’s Beautiful Loser through 1991’s The Fire Inside had been certified platinum by the end of 1991, with several of those being certified   (Stranger in Town and Night Moves were each certified 5x platinum, Live Bullet and Against the Wind were each certified 4x) totaling something in the general vicinity of 25 million albums sold, plus or minus a grain of salt. After 1992 we can get a lot more precise, thanks to statistics collected by Nielsen. According to their figures, Seger’s sold about another 22 million since then. That’s almost 50 million albums sold since 1975. But look how   those ’  sales are: That chart suggests that, excepting spikes around new album releases and tours to promote them (as in ’95, ’06 and ’14) or new compilations (as in ’94, ’03 and ’11) Seger was reliably selling over 600, 000 albums per year for most of the ’90s and ’00s. Whatever other artists might have been experiencing, the music business was still working the way it always had for Bob Seger in 2006. Face The Promise came out that September and was certified platinum before the year was out, as all but one of his albums since 1977 had managed. And all those sales of Face The Promise were physical albums. Though iTunes was introduced in 2003 and digital sales saw huge growth year over year, Punch’s suspicion of digital music services’ effect on album oriented artists lasted until Seger’s annual sales dropped below 350, 000. That happened in 2010 in 2011 Seger’s latest anthology, Ultimate Hits, was released on iTunes as well as physically. But 2011 proved poor timing to make a big deal about finally coming to iTunes. The next year, download sales would plateau, before decreasing after 2013, as on demand streaming came to represent the largest share of music consumption. By that point, even Bob Seger fans had stopped buying records the way they used to. 2014’s Ride Out has yet to crack 250, 000, despite generally positive reviews (and a nifty,   cover of Billy Bragg and Wilco’s Woody Guthrie cover, ”California Stars”). Broadcast radio spins provide another gauge of how Seger’s presence might have waxed or waned over time. Several classic rockers have had remarkably steady numbers, even as digital distribution upended the rest of the music business in the new millennium. Look how consistent spins of Led Zeppelin and Queen have been, per Mediabase’s ”Big Picture” chart, which has tracked total plays across the major stations in the most popular formats for any artist with a song in the top 1000 since 2006: These two artists provide a pretty good illustration of classic rock acts who’ve remained culturally relevant enough to keep songs from a quarter century ago in the top 1000. Now let’s see how Seger’s totals compare. Holy canoli. A decade ago, Seger was being spun by DJ’s almost as frequently as Led Zeppelin, but he’d plummeted 80% by 2014, before dropping out of the top 1000 songs list entirely last year. Narrowing our focus just to Classic Rock stations, we can see similar signs of trouble: Per Mediabase, Seger was the    artist in the format in 2000. In 2008, he was No. 13. Last year, He was No. 27. I asked Mike Boila, the Vice President of Gear Publishing Company, if the pace of licensing requests, which had proven so effective for Risky Business and Chevrolet, had seen any changes since Seger’s ’80s and ’90s triumphs. Those, at least, seem to have held steady: ”The number of synch requests has remained consistent over the years,” he said. He then reeled off an impressive list of uses, and if the movies (The Rose, Body Heat, Forrest Gump, The Mask, Armageddon, Grown Ups) were mostly from the ’80s and ’90s, the TV shows displayed a more expansive range, extending back from Cheers and Miami Vice to more recent entries such as 30 Rock, Ray Donovan and Mr. Robot, and even included several Spanish translations of Seger tunes for HBO’s East Bound  Down (you can get a taste of the Spanish version of ”Night Moves” here). Boila discusses ”reviewing all requests large or small,” with a care and attention to creative nuance that makes clear how seriously management treats Seger’s songs. They’re not simply looking to squeeze the maximum revenue out of his catalog, they want to honor it, and they recognize that such uses can be an important discovery mechanism for new fans. However, ”the extent to which you are making a first impression with an audience makes it all the more important to be careful what impression you are making. It’s important to us that the use does not recast the song in a different light  —   for example, we do not approve uses which make the song itself the butt of a joke. Also, sometimes the music will fit the tempo of a scene very well, but the lyrics don’t make sense in context.” Making sure a given use works creatively, Boila says, ”is the key to maintaining the   integrity of a catalog.” But what use is courting new fans through licensing deals if so little of Seger’s catalog is available where the majority of listeners are looking for it? And how does letting so many of the original albums fall out of print square with maintaining the integrity of his catalog? Seger’s relatively steady album sales numbers prior to 2007 mask an earlier, more troubling change: The vast majority of sales through the ’00s were driven by the original Greatest Hits compilation, which by 2009 was not just Seger’s   record at over eight times platinum, but was also the   catalog CD of the ’00s, surpassing greatest hits discs by both Michael Jackson and The Beatles. In other words, if Punch is right that that Bob Seger is an album artist, he’s wrong that iTunes represented the biggest existential threat to Seger’s artistic expression. Once Greatest Hits was released in 1994, listeners no longer had much need, or demonstrated much desire, to obtain old Bob Seger LPs. Through 1991, over 70% of Bob Seger’s sales were driven by his 14 studio albums. But that percentage has flipped in the years since. Compilations  —   greatest hits and live sets  —   have accounted for more than 70% of his sales since Nielsen Music started tracking the numbers. That shift seems to have created a weird feedback loop that mimicks what happened to Seger’s back catalog in the ’70s. Back then, the fact that no one was buying the old albums made it easier for manager and artist to treat them with a sort of benign neglect, letting their influence wane while focusing on what was working better: raucous live shows to rapturous audiences from the Midwest down to Florida. It feels like a pattern might be repeating. Much as Seger’s status as a regional star from 1964 through 1976 left him free to record and tour where he felt most comfortable, but those same decisions prevented him from breaking out to the wider national audience he craved, his current level of very substantial success eliminates any pressing need to participate more fully in the digital age. Even at their reduced levels, his sales remain enviable, so royalties, steady synch fees and his ability to sell out arenas whenever he feels like hitting the road risk obscuring any missed opportunities when it comes to securing his legacy more completely for future generations. He’s returned to having a core base of rabid supporters, but once again there are millions more he could be reaching but isn’t. Seger might simply be too humble to consider the kind of catalog curation someone like Bruce Springsteen’s been overseeing with his early work as a necessary endeavor. Reading through 40 years’ worth of Bob Seger interviews drives home how embarrassed he seems by talking about himself, as well as how unimpressed he remains with a fair portion of his old records. That personality, coupled with a   musician’s innate suspicion of anything that could be perceived as taking advantage of fans, has left Seger one of the few multiplatinum artists with a   career who’s never even released a boxed set. Though he’s worked hard to maintain a consistent level of quality in both his songwriting and recording since breaking through in ’76, he’s demonstrated little interest in having a public profile beyond the work itself. He does few interviews when he doesn’t have a new album to promote. He resisted making music videos well into the ’80s, and only engaged   once he succumbed. He took a long break between albums and tours after ’96 to raise his kids. He’s stayed in Michigan, and has left all the business decisions to Punch, possibly because a more mercenary manager might have talked him out of more than one of those choices. These are admirable qualities in a superstar! And through 2007, the public profile of the work itself didn’t suffer overmuch. Ten years ago, it was still a safe bet that a new Bob Seger record would go platinum. Now, one can barely get halfway to gold. He’s not unique in that regard, but he is unique in this one: He’s not making it possible for anyone who hasn’t already purchased that new record to ever hear it. Punch is aware of the new reality, though to hear him tell it, retailers are the ones to blame for the unavailability of Seger’s back catalog. When I ask him why he hasn’t kept more of the old titles in print physically, or at least released them as album only downloads online, he explains: ”iTunes has a policy of not permitting ’album only’ downloads except in some instances. From the very beginning, we were very concerned as to how this policy would affect album oriented rock artists in the long run and certainly there is evidence that this policy has contributed to a decline in the format. At the same time, physical retailers have been reducing the footprint of music in their stores to such a degree where deeper, back catalog titles have a tougher time reaching an audience.” If Punch is right about the state of the industry, Seger is in a pickle: The priorities of iTunes and Spotify might have changed the way people listen in the digital era, but those new priorities make it harder for him to argue for a reversal for the sake of Seger’s back catalog. And if shrinking physical retail space means it’s harder to market Seger’s early LPs, letting them all fall out of print only makes it harder for anyone hear them as the artist intended. In the name of preserving his client’s vision as an album artist, compilations have become the default option in both environments, causing the old albums to fade in favor of individual songs. And those choices have left us with fewer of those songs than there used to be. Back in 1978, flipping through that S bin, there were four Springsteen albums, compared to 11 Bob Seger records. Today, in iTunes, there are 30 Springsteen albums compared to just five of Seger’s more than 400 Bruce songs, only 81 Bob songs. The Early Seger Volume 1 compilation you can buy in iTunes features precisely six of the 66 total tracks from his out of print albums. Can an artist will the culture to forget work he no longer considers worth remembering? Does the artist risk that same culture forgetting the impact he once had if he simply doesn’t   with the standard corporate imperatives to join in every new format shift, to eagerly repackage and   previously successful material? These questions matter, because as time passes, popular culture has its own way of doing the same sort of culling I was engaged in as a    record shopper  —   indeed, the combination of choices made by millions of other shoppers is just one of the mechanisms through which that larger winnowing occurs in the first place. The program directors who invented and expanded on the concept of Classic Rock as a distinct radio format in the ’80s did another, rather literal form of culling, reducing the more freeform AOR playlists of the ’70s into an   menu of reliably   songs. Seger’s records survived the initial narrowing of the Classic Rock canon. But I fear they won’t fare so well as the industry format shifts yet again to a streaming model. We’ve moved to an age of algorithms, in which huge amounts of data about artists, songs and the people who play them determine what new listeners are exposed to. Since Seger’s material is barely counted in that data today, he might be writing himself out of the canon. The songs are powerful, though  —   hopefully powerful enough to weather the drought until they’re finally fully available online. Pressed for details about if and when that might happen, Punch offers the same answer he and Seger have been giving fans for years: ”We are working on some plans to reintroduce back catalog in a variety of traditional and   ways. Stay tuned . .. ” I’ll stay tuned, because I already care. I remain worried about those who could, but don’t yet  —   if it takes too long for those old albums to come online, Seger’s chance to capture their attention could pass. He may become like Bing Crosby, with all those old albums once again available, but only the nostalgic bothering to play them."
"Author’s note, His name has been lost to history, but in the 1970s, prisoners, wardens and prison guards across the U. S. knew of Martin Sostre. He was a fearless prison activist at the dawn of the age of mass incarceration, an inmate willing to risk months in solitary confinement to fight for prisoners’ rights. He was one of the first prisoners to successfully challenge his conditions in court and won his biggest victory when he crossed paths with a pioneering judge. I met Sostre shortly after he was released from prison in 1976. He’d been granted executive clemency by the governor of New York on Christmas Eve in 1975. I was a novice reporter, and he was the subject of my first big story. That year, he had been declared a political prisoner by Amnesty International the conviction that put him behind bars was undercut when the primary witness claimed he had been pressured by police to set up Sostre. Decades later, I’m still writing about solitary confinement and false convictions  —   interests of mine first sparked by Sostre. Several years ago, I started looking for him. I found a few newspaper stories from the 1980s. I found addresses in Florida and New York that may have been his. I wrote him a letter, but didn’t hear back. I didn’t know if he was dead or alive. I kept looking because Martin Sostre  —   who did so much to protect the rights of prisoners  —   deserves to be remembered.  ”Street dude, a hustler” Sostre was born in Harlem in 1923. His parents were black and Puerto Rican  —   his father a house painter and mechanic his mother, a seamstress. He dropped out of high school during the Great Depression to help support his family. He wasn’t political yet, but in Harlem in the 1930s, ’40s and ’50s, Sostre heard the   radicals making speeches about black nationalism and leftist movements that promised delivery from racial oppression. Sometimes, Sostre would walk into the African National Memorial Bookstore on Seventh Avenue, where owner Lewis Michaux let customers with little or no money for books sit in the store for hours and read. Sostre also heard his own father make speeches around the house, ”always referring to the capitalists in Spanish as ’the vandals,’ ” he once told a reporter. ”My father was a talking communist  —   he talked about it but never did anything.” Sostre was drafted into the Army in 1942, then kicked out after getting in a fight. He came back to Harlem in 1946 with no job skills. He was, by his own description, a ”street dude, a hustler.” His first arrest was in 1952 for possession of heroin. He was sentenced to six to 12 years and ended up, first, at Sing Sing, on June 19, 1953, the night convicted spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed there. Sostre remembered the lights flickering throughout the prison when the switch was pulled on the electric chair. Life changed dramatically once he got to prison. On the streets, he once explained, ”You’re hustling, you’re looking over one shoulder to be sure you don’t get busted and over the other to be sure you don’t get ripped off. Living in the streets by your wits makes you alert. In jail I decided to put that sharpened awareness to another purpose. For the first time, I had a chance to think, and began reading everything I could  —   history, philosophy, and law.” He made a distinction between a political prisoner and a ”politicized prisoner,” a label he preferred. ”A politicized prisoner,” he explained, is ”one who has become politically aware while in prison, even though the original crime that he committed was not a political crime.” His political education began with the Nation of Islam, which found harsh prisons were a good place to recruit new members. Just several years earlier, Malcolm X had gone to prison and become a Black Muslim. ”I identified with Malcolm X because he was a street hustler, like me,” Sostre said. In the prison yard at Clinton prison (known as ”Little Siberia” because of its location in cold and isolated Dannemora, N. Y.) Sostre would join the other inmates who gathered to teach themselves about black history and Islam. Teddy Anderson was a popular inmate because he was the only one with a copy of the Quran. Sometimes he’d let Sostre or another prisoner borrow it for short periods. And even though Sostre would later say he was attracted to Black Muslims for their politics, and not for the religion, he insisted on buying his own copy of the Quran  —   which was a political act in prison. Prison officials did not recognize the Nation of Islam as an authorized religion, but Sostre demanded he be allowed visits from Black Muslim ministers, just like other prisoners could get visits from ministers and priests. In response, prison officials branded Sostre a troublemaker and put him in solitary confinement. In solitary, he later told the writer Arthur Dobrin, ”I slept on a concrete floor with no bed and no mattress. All I had was a blanket which they gave me at night and took away early the next morning. The floor was so hard and cold that I could sleep only 10 minutes in one position. . .. There was no light, no running water, no toilet.” He could no longer go to the library, where he’d spent long hours reading law books. But he could write and file lawsuits  —   even though nothing was likely to come of them. Prisoners, courts had ruled, lost their constitutional rights once they had been convicted. Wardens had wide discretion. A prisoner could take a complaint to state court but was not protected by federal civil rights law. Sostre read history and the Constitution carefully and believed his right to practice the religion of his choice was a fundamental freedom. He and two other Black Muslim inmates sued the warden, claiming they had been denied the right to buy the Quran and practice their religion and had been put in solitary confinement as punishment. In 1961, they won. In Pierce v. LaVallee and in Sostre v. LaVallee, federal judges ruled that the men had rights to practice their religion  —   and more broadly that even inmates had rights guaranteed under the U. S. Constitution, including the right to challenge prison conditions. Other Black Muslims around the country would bring similar suits. It would be another Black Muslim prisoner, Thomas Cooper in Illinois, whose similar lawsuit would first reach the Supreme Court. And in 1964, the high court, in Cooper v. Pate, agreed that inmates kept their constitutional rights in prison and could sue in federal court over prison conditions. ”Scholars describe it as sort of the Brown v. Board [of Education] of the prisoners’ rights movement,” says historian Garrett Felber. It was Sostre’s earlier lawsuit  —   and another one he won later  —   that set the precedents that Felber says became ”the building blocks” for the Supreme Court’s groundbreaking decision in Cooper. Felber was helping the late Columbia University historian Manning Marable edit the papers of Malcolm X when he first came across Sostre. Felber, who recently finished his dissertation on the Nation of Islam and the politics of black nationalism, is now editing a book of Sostre’s papers. Sostre, he notes, paid a price for his court victories. He served the entire 12 years of his sentence for drug possession  —   four years of it in solitary confinement. Buffalo in flames, Sostre left Attica in October 1964. He was 41 and had never held a standard job. Just months before, Malcolm X had split with Elijah Muhammad and left the Nation of Islam. Sostre followed. Now out of prison, he would have to reinvent himself. He moved to Buffalo, N. Y. where he knew he could find   work at the Bethlehem Steel plant. He began to save to open a bookstore. A year later, he opened the Afro Asian Book Shop and stocked the shelves with leftist literature, from Malcolm to Mao. Those books didn’t draw customers at first. Buffalo didn’t have the charged political atmosphere of Harlem. But things turned around the day Sostre got the idea to buy a $20 record player at a pawn shop and then $50 worth of jazz and rhythm and blues records. He put a loudspeaker outside the store, and the music brought young black men inside. Sostre enjoyed playing the role of mentor. ”I taught continually  —   giving out pamphlets free to those who had no money,” he later wrote. ”I let them sit and read for hours in the store.” There was another group that gravitated toward him  —   white students at the nearby State University of New York at Buffalo. ”A lot of white students went into the ghetto in Buffalo” for the jazz bars and ”to see what was interesting,” recalls Jerry Ross, who was a leader of the campus   War group. Sostre’s bookstore was interesting ”because it was so unusual,” a place dedicated to leftist political literature. ”But what was really interesting was Martin himself,” says Ross. ”He just had this charisma. He always had this broad smile and a glow. He just was an unusual human being he obviously was very intelligent.” Ross says police were suspicious of Sostre. Once, Sostre said, a detective came into the store and asked why he was selling ”commie literature” and left with a warning: ”This kind of stuff can get you in trouble.” When a tavern next to the bookstore burned in the spring of 1967, firefighters deliberately put their hoses into Sostre’s shop, Ross says, destroying his book collection. So Ross and his friends ”just basically took our own bookshelves and all our radical books”  —   the ones they had bought from Sostre  —   ”and took them down there” to restock the store. Racial tensions were high in Buffalo in the summer of 1967. Young black men complained that police harassed or arrested them unfairly. That same summer, there would be riots and disturbances in more than 100 black urban neighborhoods, notably in Newark, N. J. and Detroit, all places with similar conditions of high unemployment, friction with police and racial discrimination. In Buffalo, over several days and nights at the end of June, groups of teens and young black men set fires, turned over cars and clashed with hundreds of police in riot gear. Neighborhood stores closed early. But Sostre’s bookstore stayed open. ”Needless to say, I made political hay in denouncing the police brutality going on outside to large crowds in the store,” he explained in a letter from prison to his supporters. During the uprisings, he took books and pamphlets off the shelves, maybe writings by Malcolm X, and read aloud. ”With interest stimulated, I would make several sales and create several new freedom fighters.” Police suspected that Molotov cocktails were being made in the basement of the store and that Sostre was directing people to loot and burn. On July 14 at 10:30 at night, several police officers rushed into the Afro Asian Book Shop and arrested Sostre and Geraldine Robinson, the woman who worked behind the counter. Sostre was charged with arson, riot and selling heroin. The main witness against Sostre was a drug addict named Arto Williams who had come into his bookstore and, police said, bought $15 worth of heroin. Police found the marked bills in the cash register. Sostre insisted he’d been framed  —   saying Williams had simply asked him to hold on to the money and that he had done similar favors for him before, once holding a suit Williams had brought back from the cleaners. Bail was set high at $50, 000 because, police said, Sostre made thousands of dollars a week selling drugs. The judge curtly told Sostre he could raise bail through his ”connections” with ”Hong Kong and the Viet Cong and Black Power.” Sostre sat in jail. On Aug. 4, Buffalo Commissioner of Police Frank Felicetta went to Washington to testify before a congressional committee investigating riots that summer around the country. Sostre had not been indicted yet, but a grand jury was meeting to consider the charges against him. And although Felicetta did not say the name Martin Sostre, he did tell the members of Congress about a ”Martin X” who ran a school to teach young black men how to make Molotov cocktails and that Martin X had instructed the young black men to break store windows and start fires and that Martin X, himself, had thrown some of the homemade bombs. Felicetta’s testimony was   news in Buffalo. Sostre always insisted he hadn’t sold drugs and had been set up by the police. Ross says the bookstore was known as a place to buy leftist books, not drugs. ”Martin was a very upstanding and moral kind of person and never smoked weed or drank and was not a drug user or pusher,” says Ross. Sostre maintained a healthy diet, a practice he had picked up from his days as a Black Muslim. He exercised regularly and practiced yoga, a discipline that helped him get through his earliest years in solitary confinement. By the time Sostre’s trial started in March 1968, prosecutors had dropped the arson and riot charges and were focused on the alleged drug crime. But the prosecution had already turned into a wild political spectacle. During pretrial procedures, Sostre was brought to court in chains. He denounced the judge as a ”racial bigot in judicial robes.” The judge ordered him bound and gagged. This was two years before a similar scene would famously play out in a Chicago courtroom with Black Panther Bobby Seale. Sostre acted as his own lawyer. On March 4, he thought he was coming to court to argue for a reduction of his bail. The judge denied his request and the trial started immediately. Sostre didn’t query prospective jurors, who very likely had heard the press reports that had depicted him as radical Martin X. He refused to   prosecution witnesses or call defense witnesses of his own. An   jury was selected at 10 a. m. and the jury was deliberating by 12:15. They took lunch at 1 p. m. and returned a guilty verdict by 3:15 that afternoon. Judge Frederick Marshall sentenced Sostre to 30 to 41 years in prison. It seemed disproportionate to the crime. The same judge, a year later, sentenced another black man, convicted of stabbing his wife to death, to a   to   prison term. In a solitary ”cage” In June 1968, Sostre ended up in solitary after dropping an envelope addressed to his attorney in the prison mailbox. Inside was a motion for a change of venue for the woman who had been arrested in the bookstore with him. Sostre had written it out by hand, in tiny print, because paper was hard to come by in prison and expensive in the commissary. When the warden called him to his office, the document was on his desk. ”Do you have a license to practice law?” the warden asked. Then he sent Sostre to solitary confinement, charged with breaking a prison ”rule” about practicing law. Sostre would spend six years in solitary for violating rules like that one. The hardest part of life in solitary, Sostre said, was being removed from contact with other people. He was entitled to an hour a day in a small, enclosed recreation yard. But every time he left his cell, guards made him strip, bend over and submit to a rectal search. They knew they wouldn’t find anything, he argued, since he was allowed few personal items, other than toothpaste and a toothbrush. ”Now they know you don’t have anything in your rectum. They just do this to dehumanize you,” he told filmmakers of  ! The Imprisonment of Martin Sostre, a 1974 documentary by Pacific Street Films. To be naked and searched with ”two or three hacks leering at you,” Sostre said, ”that’s a sign, of not only of submission, but it’s symbolic of being sodomized. And a lot of prisoners submit to that, but I’m not going to submit.” ”Because Martin Sostre refused to submit to the rectal searches, he has been beaten, not once, but 11 times,” his attorney Lynn Walker, of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told me. ”I’ve personally seen him after such a beating. All bruises, cuts and scratches along his body.” After one of those fights, Sostre was charged with assaulting the guards and, after a trial in 1975, more time  —   up to four years  —   was added to his sentence. To Sostre, the prison system was a racist place, where guards, who were almost all white (only 2 percent were black or Puerto Rican, according to later trial testimony) controlled inmates who were mostly  —   and increasingly  —     or Hispanic (70 percent in all New York prisons, according to the testimony). ”It is a   concentration camp for black people,” Sostre said. Sostre had chances to reduce his time in solitary. Once a guard suggested he join a new group therapy session. It was run by guards who had received just a week of training, according to court testimony. Sostre refused to participate. ”How can you help me,” he asked the guard, ”if you are the one who is oppressing me?” Sostre was given more time in solitary for refusing to participate in prison programs. From his prison cell, Sostre kept filing legal motions. He challenged solitary confinement, the rectal searches, the insistence that he shave off his neat goatee and mustache (prison officials said the facial hair let him hide his identity Sostre argued it made him stand out since he was the only one) and the refusal of prison authorities to let him receive political literature. And Sostre tried, but failed, to get a new trial on the drug charges that he said were a  . Three years after his trial, Williams, who had been the main witness against Sostre, was in a drug rehab program in California. He recanted his testimony against Sostre. In an affidavit, he explained he’d been in jail when a detective asked him if Sostre sold drugs. He wanted to get out of jail so he said yes although he wasn’t aware of any   at the bookstore. The next day, police sent him to Sostre’s store, with the $15 in marked bills, to make a drug buy. He said what police then found in his pocket was heroin he had bought earlier in the day, but not from Sostre. A federal judge called Williams’ new version ”unworthy of belief” and denied Sostre a new trial. A visionary judge, The singular prisoner advocate was about to cross paths with an extraordinary judge. U. S. District Court Judge Constance Baker Motley was a symbol of a nation changing. She was the first black female appointed to the federal bench. And she had come directly from the civil rights movement, having been a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. She helped write the original complaint in Brown v. Board of Education and was the first black woman to argue a case before the U. S. Supreme Court. In that one, she won the right for James Meredith to attend the University of Mississippi she went on to win nine of the 10 cases she argued before the high court. On July 2, 1969, Baker Motley ordered Sostre released immediately from solitary confinement at Green Haven prison. She then held a trial and, the next year, issued a scathing ruling, in Sostre v. Rockefeller, about the conditions of Sostre’s solitary confinement. He had been punished, she ruled, ”not because of any serious infraction of the rules of prison discipline, or even for any minor infraction” but for his legal and ”political activities and beliefs.” The ruling set the boundaries for the fight against solitary confinement that continues to this day. In her ruling, Baker Motley called Sostre’s solitary confinement ”physically harsh, destructive of morale, dehumanizing in the sense that it is needlessly degrading, and dangerous to the maintenance of sanity when continued for more than a short period of time which should certainly not exceed 15 days.” Baker Motley’s ruling from 47 years ago is still relevant in the current debate over the use of solitary confinement. Today, human rights groups and others that oppose solitary confinement still push for the   period as a maximum someone can safely stay in solitary. But no state nor the federal system, by law, currently recognizes that as a limit. ”What was really striking,” says Heather Ann Thompson, a University of Michigan historian who won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for the nonfiction book Blood in the Water, about the uprising at Attica prison, ”was how a federal judge would essentially say to a state prison system, ’You are out of line. You can’t treat someone like this.’ ” In addition, Baker Motley awarded Sostre $9, 300 in compensatory damages ($25 for each day in solitary) and $3, 720 in punitive damages ($10 for each day). Bob Brown, who was finishing a sentence for armed robbery and murder when he met Sostre in prison, once told me how frightened prison guards were after Sostre’s victory. One older guard told him: ”The judge gave him everything he wanted. We might as well close up this place. . .. Brownie, it’s all up to you white guys now. You’ve just got to do something.” Brown, who when he told me this story was out of prison and teaching at the City University of New York, said the guard ”was instigating a race riot.” But the white prisoners knew that what Sostre had accomplished helped them, too. And they didn’t trust that guards wouldn’t take it out on them, too, if they fought Sostre and other black prisoners. ”But I guess the significance of the story,” Brown concluded, ”is that here was a guard who . .. had a sense of powerlessness and outrage, that this black mother****** could sue him if he stepped out of line. . .. That was a sense of outrage that they just couldn’t cope with.” Indeed, for prison officials, Baker Motley’s decision felt like the ground was crumbling under their feet. Courts had generally given prison wardens wide discretion to run prisons how they saw fit to keep order and safety. Now a judge was telling the warden at Green Haven that he would have to change the way he used solitary confinement for one of his biggest troublemakers in prison. An appeals court later overturned much of Baker Motley’s ruling and reduced the damages awarded to Sostre. Still, Thompson says Sostre’s victory was so momentous that prisoners and wardens across the country paid attention. It gave prisoners ”the belief that if they take their story to the courts, that someone will listen to them and that human rights can, in fact, be had if you’re heard in the court of law.” But it also frightened prison officials  —   and they would want to crack down on inmates who tried to assert these newfound rights. This would play out a year later, in 1971, when more than 1, 000 inmates at New York’s Attica Correctional Facility took over the prison. The Attica prisoners considered Sostre a hero and demanded the kinds of rights and better prison conditions that Sostre had sought: legal representation at parole hearings, better medical treatment, the right to read political newspapers and to form labor unions (Sostre had led strikes at a prison license plate shop) better food, regular showers and more than one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper a month. They asked that Baker Motley be sent as an observer. But Gov. Nelson Rockefeller  —   who had sought the Republican presidential nomination and still had ambitions to the White House —   sent in state troopers to retake the prison, with a deadly hail of gunfire. Rockefeller reacted harshly, says Thompson, in part because he feared what Sostre had started: He had inspired prisoners to stand up for rights  —   whether that meant taking over a prison yard or going to court. Litigation by inmates claiming violations of their constitutional rights would grow sharply  —   until 1996, when Congress passed a law making it harder to bring those lawsuits. Clemency with a catch, In 1975, Sostre’s case was still a cause just on the political left, but there were signs that could change. A key moment came in June, when a federal judge ordered Sostre transferred to a new federal prison in Manhattan, because his life seemed to be in danger after beatings by guards in New York state prisons. Sostre’s move to the city ”electrified everything,” Daniel Berrigan, the activist priest told me then, because it made it easier for nearby advocates to visit him. That summer, Berrigan started ”The Committee to Free Martin Sostre,” with his brother Philip Berrigan and other political activists and civil rights leaders, including Angela Davis, Ralph Abernathy, Julian Bond and Ramsey Clark. Their work started gaining attention. Amnesty International named Sostre one of seven political prisoners in the United States. And in early December, Soviet dissident Andre Sakharov, who had just won the Nobel Peace Prize that year, called for Sostre’s release. And another case  —   across the river in New Jersey  —   helped Sostre. At the time, the idea that sometimes innocent people end up in jail was not widely understood. But the case of Rubin ”Hurricane” Carter was sparking a new national interest in false convictions. Carter was in prison, convicted of a triple homicide in a Patterson, N. J. bar. But he said he had been mistakenly identified by a witness. Carter, an   was a more romantic figure than Sostre, a political radical. Bob Dylan had just released a popular and stirring ballad about Carter and played a benefit concert. (Eventually, Carter’s conviction would be overturned.) New York Gov. Hugh Carey worried that Sostre’s case could get similar attention. And besides, when his staff looked into it, they realized there was merit to Sostre’s claims. Still, it was a surprise when news leaked out in December that Carey was thinking seriously about freeing Sostre. In Buffalo, law enforcement and city officials reacted with anger. Sostre was still remembered there as an instigator of the 1967 uprisings. The judge who had sentenced Sostre wrote to say Sostre was not a political prisoner but a drug dealer and a dangerous political extremist who ”has expressed, time and again, disregard for our laws, public officials and system of jurisprudence.” On Christmas Eve, Carey granted Sostre executive clemency. He used parole and clemency to free Sostre without saying whether Sostre had been falsely convicted of the drug crime in Buffalo. Sostre had spent all but 2   years of the previous 22 in prison, spread over two prison sentences, the last one for nine years. When I spoke to him by phone while he was imprisoned, he worried about whether he would be able to live freely once he left prison. ”Prison is a closed society with   walls and the public can’t see in,” he explained. That made it easy to violate someone’s human rights. But they could be violated outside prison walls, too. ”I consider the outside only a minimum security and inside prison is sort of a maximum security.” Sostre walked out on Feb. 9, 1976. The next day, he held a press conference at the United Nations. Sostre praised the governor’s ”courage” to release him, but explained: ”I know it’s fashionable to say I’m not bitter. Of course I am. I lost nine years of my life. I’m a human being. I’m bitter this sort of thing goes on in a   humane society.” My search for Sostre, My story on Sostre for my graduate school master’s thesis was due a few weeks after he came home. My adviser told me to rip up what I’d already written and rewrite it to tell the story of Sostre’s readjustment to life outside prison. I resisted. It would mean asking for a lot of his time. I doubted Sostre wanted to spend his first days of freedom with me. ”You’re a journalist,” my professor told me. ”And your job is to get the story, even if that means sleeping on his doorstep.” I countered with ”I’m not a journalist. I’m a journalism student. And he just spent nine years in prison.” My professor insisted. So I found ways to be useful to Sostre. He needed an apartment. I looked through the want ads in the Village Voice and reported back to him. He held his press conference, I went. He made speeches. I went. He went to housing court as part of his new job as a tenant advocate on State Assemblywoman Marie Runyon’s staff. I went. Sostre didn’t complain. I think he liked being able to share his views about prison, justice and the legal system, especially with a student. The last time I saw Sostre was on April 8, 1976, a warm spring day when I walked from Morningside Heights to his office on the ninth floor of the state office building at 125th Street in Harlem. From his window, he pointed out the neighborhood he grew up in. He talked about his new apartment and his surprise at the recent verdict in the Patty Hearst case, and that she had gotten any prison time at all, given that ”she had everything going for her” in money and power. He was striking in the uniform he had adopted for himself: a blue denim jacket and jeans, a blue   and hiking boots. His head was shaved  —   as it was in prison  —   and his   goatee was graying. I walked with him to a print shop where he picked up flyers for a fundraiser for his boss. She had advocated for his release. And just a few days after leaving prison, he had eagerly started a job in her office. The prison revolutionary who had described himself as a ”revolutionary anarchist” was now working within the system. He was accepting invitations to visit college campuses and tell his story and talk about prison. And he focused on the chance to do a new kind of civil rights work on behalf of tenants. ”The battlefield has changed from the dungeon to the streets,” he’d told me. ”But the repression is the same.” It was an adjustment to freedom after all those years in prison. He didn’t trust state officials, who he expected would find a way to send him back to prison. (In fact, a state prison official had told me: ”Martin Sostre is going to have to walk a very careful tightrope because they’ll try to slam him for the slightest infraction. ”) Sostre had shown me the copy of his parole agreement he kept in the breast pocket of his denim jacket. He called it ”a blank check . .. a contract with a gun to your head.” He couldn’t marry, buy a car or quit his job without the permission of his parole officer. And some conditions of his parole were open to interpretation  —   like his promise that his behavior would not be a ”menace . .. to society.” He told me he worried that his criticism of government and the prison system  —   when he gave speeches  —   could be seen that way. More recently, over the past several years as I wrote more about false convictions and solitary confinement, I thought more, too, about Sostre. I’d ask prison reform advocates I interviewed if they knew the name Martin Sostre. They didn’t. He hadn’t left much of a trace once he left prison. I found a story from the 1980s about a community education program he had started with a friend in New Jersey. I tracked down the friend, but he had split bitterly with Sostre in a fight over money. I found addresses for Sostre in Florida and in New York. In 2014, I sent him a letter, but I didn’t hear back and didn’t know if the letter even reached him. But last spring, a Facebook post put me back on Sostre’s trail. I went to a reunion of my Columbia Graduate School of Journalism class and, in the library, I looked up my original master’s thesis on Sostre. I took a picture of the opening paragraph and posted it on Facebook. A short time later, a college friend, someone from a totally different part of my life, responded: ”I would love to see your thesis as I am friends with his wife.” That’s how I ended up at a Sunday brunch on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with Liz Sostre, Martin’s widow. Sostre had died just eight months before after a series of small strokes. Liz Sostre lovingly described her husband as a ”very complicated” man. He was smart, funny and principled. He saw widespread injustice in the world, but he was optimistic that it could be fixed. He was a champion of the poor, but he dismissed people who said ”money is evil” as people who usually had it. Money was a good thing, he said. The problem was that not everyone had enough of it. He even liked to play the stock market,   on the computer. He was gregarious and charming. But he also liked to be alone. His past prison activism became a faded part of his identity. Once, a producer wanted to make a TV movie. James Earl Jones would play Sostre. Martin and Liz ended up poolside at the producer’s Hollywood home. But Liz says the project died when Sostre and Jones worried that the screenwriters were ”watering it down too much.” Sometimes people who knew his role in the prisoners’ rights movement, maybe a journalist or an academic, would send a letter. He’d ignore it, maybe not even open it, and just put it on a pile of mail. That’s probably what happened to the letter I’d sent a few years before. He would only ever get back to other inmates he had known in prison. Liz Sostre had been a member of Prairie Fire, the ”aboveground” support group for the Weather Underground. She had been doing prison reform work when she met the famous prisoners’ rights advocate shortly after he was freed. ”I thought we’d still be doing prison work,” she says, ”and he said, ’Nah. I’m out. I’m not in prison now.’ ” For Sostre, she says, the past was the past. His son Vinny says his father talked all the time about politics and current events, cutting out stories from the New Yorker, the New York Times or the free neighborhood paper for him to read. But he didn’t talk much about his own life growing up, or about prison. It’s moving to hear the taped interviews Vinny made with his father a few years before he died. Vinny knows little about Sostre’s prison history  —   or even his importance to the prisoners’ rights movement. He uses his father’s brief Wikipedia entry to ask me about his father’s history. (”You’re associated with, what is it, like Black Muslims or something like that? ”) In the recordings, Sostre seems at moments eager to fill in his son’s knowledge but then bored  —   and sometimes he simply seems forgetful about things so far in his past. But by the time he came home in 1976, Sostre was already becoming a footnote  —   his prison victories and significance already in the past. Solitary confinement and sentencing were no longer the primary focus of East Coast prison activists. They focused on defending the Attica inmates who were facing trial. There was less of a clear role for Sostre. And partly it was Sostre’s own personality. He was ”very, very much by himself,” Liz says. In some ways, it had been easier for him to work by himself, from his prison cell. He had spent nine years in solitary confinement and liked to have space to himself. ”He called himself a ’revolutionary anarchist.’ So he didn’t like groups, committees, meetings,” she says. ”So he didn’t work with any other groups whatsoever.” There was one exception: the groups he organized himself. He helped organize renters, including those in his own building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Liz still lives and Vinny lives in an apartment on another floor. ”We had a terrible landlord and most of the apartments were vacant,” Liz recalls. ”There were a lot of issues in the building. So he organized the building and formed a tenants’ organization and he ran meetings. Then he began to organize other buildings on the block. We formed a block association. So he was doing that kind of organizing.” And with that friend I found in New Jersey, he had bought abandoned buildings and taught neighborhood teens how to do the construction  —   to give them skills and potential housing. As part of the same project, he started a day care program, with an   program for teens. ”It was a very similar atmosphere to his bookstore,” says Vinny. ”He would educate them as to what is really going on, how they could fight injustice, and how they could help their community.” Sostre liked his new life as a father, husband and tenants’ rights advocate. And then he almost lost it all. In 1984, Sostre shot a man, a tenant he was evicting from a building he was managing. Sostre said the man and a friend threatened him and the friend had a gun. Sostre grabbed the weapon and it went off. The tenant suffered a superficial neck wound, but Sostre was charged with attempted murder. Sostre feared if he were sent to prison  —   where he was still a hated figure  —   he’d die there. So he fled New York. Liz, now, was alone, caring for two young sons. Sostre was hiding in Florida. From time to time, the family would go to see him. Assuming the police were watching her apartment, she and the boys would leave carrying large trash bags that disguised their suitcases inside. On one trip the family  —   with the fugitive father —   went to Disney World. After two years, Sostre was caught when he sneaked back into New York City. Someone spotted him in one of his favorite places  —   a law library —   and called police. At trial in 1987, Sostre argued he had acted in  . He was acquitted. Over the last years of his life, Sostre had a series of strokes. His mind stayed sharp but his physical health failed. He could no longer get up and down the steps to his building. Liz worried that her husband had become like a prisoner in his own apartment. But he disagreed. ”I was in the box for years,” he told her. ”Here I can get up, you bring me good food and all the food I want. I can walk around, watch TV. I’ve got my books. I have a bed and a blanket.” Sostre died at home on Aug. 12, 2015. He was 92. No newspaper, TV show or radio program marked the death of a   pioneer of the prisoners’ rights movement. But historian Felber notes: ”No single figure played a greater role in securing legal rights for prisoners in the history of U. S. prisons than Martin Sostre.”"

Please Return to Elise Gravel features what are presented as pages from the Canadian cartoonist’s notebook it’s a bright, colorful and quirky paean to drawing, imagination, and creativity. French cartoonist Anouk Ricard’s Anna  Froga looks like a lot of other powerfully cute,    comics, but it carries a slyly acerbic tinge that keeps things grounded and funny. Finally, an excerpt from Shigeru Mizuki’s Kitaro has one of that manga’s more unsavory characters attempting to peform a good deed. Doesn’t go well. Anything Else? This is the thickest of this year’s FCBD books, and thus the best ”value” for your . .. um . ..  ? And none of it is filler  —   just quality cartooning, from international   that provides an excellent primer to their work. Verdict? If you get no other FCBD book, get this one. If the store runs out of copies, rip one out of some little kid’s hands, if you have to. (Don’t do that.) (I’m just saying though: Them little tykes got lousy upper body strength.) (Kidding ha ha ha.) (. .. Also their little hands’ll probably be slick with like snot or ice cream or what have you, so.) Title: Help the CBLDF Defend Comics, Genre: Educational, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Every year, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund  —   an NGO dedicated to protecting comics from bans and other First Amendment infringements  —   puts together an FCBD book with stories that explore the intersection of comics and free speech. This year’s crop of seven stories is diverse and engaging, and comes at the notion of free speech in oblique and clever ways. Anything Else? One story invites readers to write their own dialogue in blank  . So not so much a story about free speech, and more a story that’s . ..  . No one is forcing you to read this post. Verdict? Yep. Title: Hilda’s Back!  Night, Genre:   Anything I Need to Know Going In? British cartoonist Luke Pearon’s Hilda series, about a headstrong little girl’s adventures through a Nordic mythscape, takes a very odd, and very welcome, turn. Features a wordless passage that’s suspenseful and funny. Also included: Jen Lee’s Garbage Night, a surprisingly melancholy tale of a dog, raccoon and a deer left behind to scavenge food after a human apocalypse. Anything Else? If you like Hilda  —   and if you’ve got two eyes and a heart, you will  —   there are plenty of graphic novels available. But Garbage Night won’t be available until June. I’m eager to see more: Lee’s creating a nice tension by setting her    against the bleakly beautiful backdrop of an empty,   suburbia. Verdict? Definitely. Title: Kid   Genre: Science   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Kid Savage follows the adventures of a mysterious feral boy fending for himself in a hostile world, who’s rescued by human space explorers. Pix is a much sunnier tale of a young teen superhero. Anything Else? Joe Kelly (of I Kill Giants, among several other books) writes Kid Savage, which is why you should trust that the strained lyricism of its opening pages will ground itself eventually. Ilya’s art is visceral  —   literally, there’s a lot of   for an   book  —   and kinetic. Pix feels markedly different, more straightforward, for younger readers. Verdict? Yes. Title:     Genre:     Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Miraculous is based on a French   series about two teenage superheroes. Kid Sherlock is . .. exactly what the name suggests. And Toyetica is a surprisingly dense  —   and, it must be said, densely worded  —   comic about fairies, civil rights and . .. toy manufacturing. Anything Else? These brief excerpts don’t provide a particularly clear sense of each title, though Kid Sherlock is crammed with fun background details that fill out its world. The Toyetica excerpt has a lot of   to do, and its thus crammed . .. with exposition. Verdict? Not one of this year’s standouts. Title: The Overstreet Guide to Collecting, Genre: Educational, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Overstreet produces price guides to collecting comics, comics art, posters, and more. This year, as every year, they’re offering an FCBD book that provides a   tour of the basics of comics collection (how to collect, what’s available, what the various comics Ages and grades mean). Not for nothing, the book also hawks Overstreet’s various guides. Anything Else? Friendly advice, offered  —   literally  —   freely. Verdict? Perfect for those just getting their feet wet. Less so for those already treading the turbid waters of nerdery. Title: Animal Jam, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Based on ”the world’s largest online playground where kids can learn about nature,” this tale introduces us to the   world of Jamaa, where talking animals live and play together. Anything Else? This one’s a bit of a puzzle. The simple characterizations and achingly sweet sunniness of the book feel aimed at very young kids, but the panels are weighed down by dense word balloons filled with concepts that might leave those very young kids mystified (”The portal! It’s becoming a vortex! ”). Plus, it’s loaded with filler  —   nearly half the book’s nothing but ads hyping various other titles. Can’t begrudge them that, of course, but it leaves the book feeling thin. Verdict? If your kids (or, for that matter, you) are familiar with the online world the book’s based on, maybe. Otherwise, skippable. Title: Bad Machinery, Genre: Mystery, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Run, don’t walk. This is just great. Excerpts the opening pages of the latest graphic novel (available this month) in British cartoonist John Allison’s series about a group of friends who investigate mysteries in an around an English grammar school. Allison’s design work is friendly and approachable, and his dialogue exudes a unique energy that feels authentically teen without seeming archly quippy. Anything Else? Allison’s particularly good at capturing the shifting dynamics of school friendships  —   the ephemeral emotions that flare up and cool, the rivalries that turn into friendships, and vice versa. Verdict? Absolutely, yes. Title: Barbie, Genre: Crass Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? At last, the gritty Barbie reboot for which millions have clamored! Everyone’s favorite        chunk of extruded plastic crawls through a ravaged,   hellscape, sustained only by her thirst for revenge and the irradiated flesh of rabid scavenging nah just kidding it’s about fashion. Anything Else? In an excerpt from Barbie: Fashion Superstar, Barbie struggles to create a garment that reflects her unique vision. In Barbie: Star Light Adventures, she’s a planetary princess aided by her friends   ”a hoverboard racing legend” and Sheena and Kareena ”who are gravity geniuses.” Like that’s a thing. Verdict? Star Light Adventures is pretty disposable, but there’s a nice message about trusting yourself in Fashion Superstar. So maybe. Depends on your kid. Title: BONGO Comics   ! Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Yeah, it’s a bunch of different stories, but they’re all squarely in the Springfield of The Simpsons. Anything Else? Standout stories include one in which Homer and Bart try to pull an   and a     spotlight. Verdict? As ever, yes. Title: DC Superhero Girls, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? DC’s ” ” toyline  —   which features Wonder Woman, Batgirl, Supergirl, Bumblebee and others, who attend Super Hero High  —   gets a comic. You are perhaps by now picking up a recurring leitmotif in many of these FCBD books. Like those others, this is determinedly earnest, if a bit blandly corporate. You know how you can read something and know in your gut that at some point, the guys in marketing signed off on it? Anything Else? This issue  —   an excerpt from (sing along, you know the words) one of the DC Superhero Girls graphic novels  —   is Wonder Woman focused, timely enough. Zeus, her estranged father, asks her to spend summer vacation with him on Mount Olympus. Verdict? If you’re looking to have the DC heroes get their hooks into your kid, this’ll probably work. Title: Doctor Who, Genre: Science   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? A satisfying tale that cleverly integrates all four   Doctors. Gets a little needlessly convoluted, but that’s Who for you. Anything Else? Opens with a very basic primer on the Whoniverse, which is helpful if you’re trying to indoctrinate a Normal. Verdict? At one point The Doctor introduces himself as ”your    space uncle.” So, duh, yes. Title: Fresh Off the Boat, Genre:    Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Characters on ABC’s Fresh Off the Boat wrote a comic in the Season 3 episode ”Pie vs. Cake,” and here it is. Synergy doesn’t get more . ..  . Plot: the Huang family gains super powers, and proceeds to fight crime  —   the crime of bad restaurant tippers. Anything Else? Fun book, great pedigree. Written by Gene Luen Yang, with art by the versatile Jorge Corona, who’s working in a Gabriel   Guillory vein here, if that means anything to you. Verdict? Yes. Title: The Loud House, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? The Nickelodeon animated series about a family of 11 squabbling kids gets a   comic. Anything Else? Solid,   gags does a lot with a big cast. Verdict? Sure. Title: Monster High, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Mattel’s   ”  franchise”  —   starring the ”clawesome” ”ghoulfriends” Draculaura, Frankie Stein, Clawdeen Wolf and yeah you get the general idea  —   gets a comic in which the characters  —   imagine if the Bratz dolls worked at Hot Topic  —   prepare for the science fair. Anything Else? Um. Frankie Stein is a         corpse who owns a adorable   corpse puppy named Watzit? Does that . .. does that factor into your decision at all? Verdict? If you or your kid is into 1) Universal Monsters, 2) accessorizing, and 3) the art and science of    then go for it. Otherwise eminently skippable. Title: SpongeBob Freestyle Funnies, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? . .. Seriously? Look, you know SpongeBob, right? That. Pretty much, that. Anything Else? On page one, SpongeBob is asked what ”  Funnybook Day” is, and he answers, ”Why, it’s the day all the graphic literature shops provide gratis samples of their wares in a pathetic effort to bolster an industry which has spent the last two decades in a death spiral brought on by the lethal interaction between the lack of variety and a monopolistic distribution system!” SpongeBob got hard, yo. Turns out it gets awful shaaaaady on the bottom of the ocean. Verdict? Yes. Title: The Tick, Genre:   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Everyone’s favorite bombastic blue blockhead throws himself a birthday party, and attends a presidential debate. Anything Else? Tick comics are a dependably good FCBD staple, though you wont won’t find much in the jokes about the election campaign that seems bracingly fresh. Verdict? Maybe. Title: Time Shifters, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Excerpt from Chris Grine’s graphic novel about a kid who stumbles across a   device that sends him careering into an adventure involving a   a vampiric Napoleon, and much more. Anything Else? Breezy, funny, with an invitingly open design that crams a lot of material onto the page without feeling cramped or weighed down with text. A quick read that’ll leave you wanting more. Verdict? Yes. Title: Underdog, Genre:   Anything I Need to Know Going In? New and vintage   yarns about Jay Ward’s classic doggy   Underdog. It’s all here, everything you’re looking for (if you’re old enough to remember the Nixon administration): Shoeshine Boy, Polly Purebred, rhyming couplets, phone booths (you may need to explain that last one to your kids). Anything Else? Delivers on its promise. Verdict? Yes.   DON’ : Title: 2000 AD, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Year in and year out, Britain’s     comics anthology series contributes some of FCBD’s grittier fare. Anything Else? If you’re not familiar with Judge Dredd or other 2000 AD titles, don’t skip the brief intros to each found inside the front cover. They’re a big help. Verdict? Even with doing that homework, some of these vignettes prove less comprehensible than others. So maybe. Title:   Land, Genre: Science    Anything I Need to Know Going In? James Cameron’s 2009   epic gets a comics adaptation with an excerpt that, if nothing else, serves as a   refresher course for those of us who can’t remember a minute of the damn thing. Brian Wood’s Briggs Land is about a family of secessionists, and despite the fact that it’s a   story, you find that puzzling out what, precisely, is at stake proves an uphill battle. Anything Else? Despite the impassiveness of the Briggs Land story, there’s always something dependably tough and grounded in Woods’ terse dialogue, supported by the way artist Werther Dell’Edera’s   emphasizes the vast and open sky above the character’s heads. It’s oppressive, that emptiness, and it tells you that something bad is bearing down them. Verdict? Yep. Title: Captain   Kitty Die, Genre:   Anything I Need to Know Going In? The Great White North’s own   gets a Year One backstory, and a teenage witch (NO NOT THAT ONE) gets up to some mighty meta hijinks at a beach party. Anything Else? The Canuck excerpt,   by Canadian actor Jay Baruchel, is a dense,         bit of business set in the Pashtun region, soon after the Captain came into his powers. The Kitty story is filled with   and   for classic comics characters, but it holds up on its own. Verdict? Sure. Title: Dragon Ball   Genre: Fantasy   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Goku is a saiyan, see, who really wants to fight Lord Beerus, God of Destruction, but to do so he’ll of course need to transform into the Super Sayan God, duh, but he’s only achieved Super Sayan 3 and you know what ask your kids. In another excerpt, Naruto’s son Boruto seeks to learn the rasengan, a new jutsu and you know what ask your kids. Anything Else? The Boruto story includes a fun extended swordfight full of Shhk! Klak! Thoom! Tmp! Spin! Swishtak! Zlash! and Klang! And the Dragon Ball Super story is written by Akira Toriyama, who created the international phenomenon back in 1984. Verdict? If this is your thing? Sure. Title: Guardians of the   Defenders, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? The     synergy is strong with this one. Writer Gerry Duggan and artist Aaron Kuder have been tasked with producing a book that looks (and sounds and smells and feels and tastes) like the blockbuster film franchise, and they’ve delivered. It’s fun, it’s fast and its characterizations are  . Do you like the film’s interpretation of the Guardians? Because this is the film’s interpretations of the Guardians. The preview of the Brian Michael   Marquez comic about The Defenders  —   the Netflix   (Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil  Iron Fist) coming soon to a streaming device near you  —   looks and feels like those shows, too. Anything Else? Duggan and Kuder have a difficult needle to thread: They need to capture the feel of the Guardians films without producing something that reads like a rote,         . Bendis wrote a stellar Daredevil run, and he essentially created Jessica Jones. He knows these characters intimately. So this Defenders preview, which busts out some of the hoariest ”The rules have changed!” cliches in the   genre  —   which is, to be clear, saying something  —   is so disappointing. Verdict? Guardians is fun, if unsurprising, which is . .. kind of the point. Marvel    won’t be able to read the Defenders preview without playing a game of ”Count The Things You’ve Seen Done Before,” but Free Comic Book Day isn’t for them. So . .. maybe. Title:   of Iraq, Genre: Nonfiction (Memoir) Anything I Need to Know Going In? Last month Drawn and Quarterly published Guy Delisle’s Hostage, which  —   trust me  —   is very, very, very good. The excerpt from the forthcoming Poppies of Iraq, written by Brigitte Findakly and illustrated by the great Lewis Trondheim, recounts Findakly’s experiences growing up in Iraq during the ’60s, a time of political turbulence and several bloody coups. Anything Else? Both excerpts depict grim events  —   a grueling experience as a hostage and brutal political violence, respectively  —   in an open, cartoony style: Delisle’s hostage sweats bullets from his temples when worried in Poppies, hanged soldiers get Xs where they eyes should be. It’s not a distancing device, but a choice that forces us to see the violence of their worlds  —   which is, of course, our world  —   in a chilling new context. Verdict? Definitely. Title: Keyser   Rift, Genre:   Commercial    Fiction, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Yeah, it’s that Keyser Soze. (As if ”Keyser Soze” were a common name like Jess, or Dave, of Jen.) (I’d so read a comic about Jen Soze, Queen of Crime, BTW.) The mysterious underworld figure from the Bryan Singer film The Usual Suspects comes to comic book life, to the relief of all those who’ve spent the last 22 years clamoring. Turns out it’s not bad  —   he shows up to a drug deal things go south. In The Rift, a boy and his mother go for a drive things go south. Anything Else? Some nice characterization and action in The Rift the Keyser Soze story is atmospheric, even if the notion of following the exploits of an infallible,       villain seems . .. less than compelling. Verdict? Maybe. Title: Secret   Parker: The Spectacular   Genre: Superhero, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Maybe you’ve heard about the controversy over Marvel’s latest event? In which it’s revealed that Captain America, Scion of All That Is Good And You Know American I Mean Come On It’s Right There In The Dude’s Name, is secretly the head of HYDRA, Marvel’s resident    ? This preview is all   but it’s your chance to see what’s getting so many noses out of joint for yourself. The   preview is a return to Spidey in quippy, classic,     mode. Anything Else? Secret Empire artist Andrea Sorrentino serves up some striking page layouts, and Paulo Siqueira’s Spidey art is big and bold. Verdict? Depends on your personal tolerance for turning heroes into Nazis for fun and profit. Title:     Shot: Salvation, Genre:   Fiction, Anything I Need to Know Going In? This is how you do FCBD. Three tiny(!) but packed vignettes that give a clear sense of the titles in question, introducing a central tension without resolving it. Anything Else? In   Manowar, a   warrior fights for right. In Secret Weapons, we glimpse a world of enhanced humans  —   and the agency that seeks to control them. In Bloodshot: Salvation, another   warrior goes searching for secrets from his past. Granted, there’s not much that’s particularly novel in those premises. But what matters  —   in genre comics, as in anything else  —   is the execution, and these three   have each got a distinct style, reminding you that genre doesn’t have to be generic. Verdict? Definitely. Title: Attack on Titan, Genre: Fantasy, Anything I Need to Know Going In? The hugely successful manga series (and concomitant anime series) from Hajime Isayama  —   about a city of many walls, constantly attacked by grotesque giants  —   is an international phenomenon. This new story by Jody Houser and Emi Lenox, set in Isayama’s world, looks at    life inside the city, far from the front lines. Anything Else? A quieter, sweeter, and sadder tale than the original series, which leans more in an    direction, generally serves up. Verdict? Yes. Title: The Ballad of Franklin Bonisteel, Genre: Crime, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Fun, atmospheric,    tale set in and around an LA motor   in the 70s. Nice character beats, and the    art captures the story’s mood so well you can almost feel the   shag carpeting. Anything Else? Technically, this one’s a sampler, as it includes a (very) brief excerpt from Murder Ballads, though it’s not mentioned in the cover, and is so short it doesn’t give you much to go on. There’s a website listed on the back where you can hear that book’s soundtrack, if that’s a thing that interests you. Verdict? Yes. Title: Betty  Veronica, Genre: Humor, Anything I Need to Know Going In? There’s a spate of     Archie titles and this book reprints the first issue of one of the best: a Betty and Veronica title written and drawn by Adam Hughes. Also features a introduction to the WB’s Riverdale, because fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and intellectual properties gotta  . Anything Else? Don’t be misled by the cover, which features the two young women at familiar loggerheads. True, the story’s about a fight between the two of them, but it’s not over Archie. So that’s good, at least, right? And yes, Hughes is known for cheesecake   art, and the cover sidles up to that, but on the interior he dials back the pulchritude and dials up the dialogue. Like, a lot. Too much, arguably. Fortunately, the dialogue in question is inventive and funny  —   much of it supplied by our narrator Jughead’s faithful pet pooch Hot Dog. Also: this series has been so beset by delays that if you pick up this freebie, you’ll be nearly caught up. Verdict? Yup. Title: Catalyst Prime, Genre: Superhero, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Introduction to a new superhero universe with a familiar premise: we’re dropped in the middle of a superhero melee, then flash back to meet five astronauts sent on a desperate mission to save Earth. You perhaps see where this is going. Anything Else? Nicely distinct characterizations, and an intriguing villain. Verdict? Yes. Title: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? A manga tale that takes place before the events of the 2006 videogame of the same name. Anything Else? Also includes an excerpt from the adaptation of the 1998 Zelda game Ocarina of Time, starring Toon Link, who is much cuter. And whose combos are better than Yoshi’s, but worse than Kirby’s. Verdict? If you ever played a Zelda game and wished it wasn’t so distractingly colorful and not so dang noisy and you didn’t have to push so many  —   well, any  —   dumb buttons . .. then yes. Title: The Looking Glass Wars: Crossfire, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Another comics spinoff of Frank Beddor’s The Looking Glass Wars trilogy, this one focusing on a spy named Ovid Grey hired by the Red Queen to something something something. Anything Else? You don’t need to know much about the dense mythology of Beddor’s ”Wondertropolis” to make sense of this  —   it’s a     caper with entertaining touches of dark magic. Magic eyeballs, missing crystal shards  —   the whole dark fantasy schmear, really. As always, Sami Makkonen’s deliberatley   art will appeal to some (hi!) and not to others. Verdict? Worth checking out, because if you like this, there’s lots more. Title: Grimm Fairy Tales, Genre: Fantasy, Anything I Need to Know Going In? The ”  ” genre? Pfft. Forget it. Yesterday’s papers. So five minutes ago. Here’s four brief excerpts from a publisher who’s proudly staked a claim on the highly specialized, and wildly impractical, ”    ” genre. Anything Else? ”The universe is made up of four realms of power: Wonderland, Oz, Neverland, and Myst.” . .. See now for that last one I was really pulling for Zork. Oh well. Can’t have everything I guess. Verdict? For those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like. Title: Lady Mechanika, Genre: Steampunk Cheesecake, Anything I Need to Know Going In? A   sexy cyborg private investigator who wields hilariously overwrought weaponry  —   and cleavage  —   to fight demons and oh by the way FYI that’s a real sentence I just wrote I’m not just playing nerd bingo with you. But if I were: automatons, gears, alchemy, dirigibles. Which this also includes. Anything Else? ”Steampunk Cheesecake” is not a terrible name for this genre, but it needs something zippier, alliterative. Clockworks and Corsets? Dirigibles and Decolletage? No wait I got it Blunderbusses and Boobies okay cut print. Verdict? For those who like this sort of thing etc. Title: Malika: Warrior Queen, Genre: Adventure, Anything I Need to Know Going In? The first chapter of the forthcoming graphic novel from YouNeek Studios about the brilliant, and formidably kickass, queen of a mythical African nation. Anything Else? Interesting layouts, exciting battle scenes, and a    feminist vibe make this one of this year’s most intriguing FCBD offerings. Verdict? Yes. Title: Rick and Morty, Genre:     Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? A comics adaptation of Cartoon Network’s gleefully reprobate animated riff on Back to the Future, featuring a drunk and wildly irresponsible mad scientist and his preternaturally fearful teen companion. Perfectly captures the show’s look, feel and  —   especially, crucially  —   humor. Anything Else? ”Juice is just an idiot stopping point between fruit and alcohol.” Verdict? Oh, definitely. Title: Riverdale, Genre: Teen Melodrama, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Features two vignettes that serve as prequels to the events of the CW series. We see how both Archie and Veronica spent their summers. Anything Else?    Riverdale’s showrunner, has written many comics over the years, and gets a ”stories by” credit here. (The two tales in question were actually written by Brian E. Paterson and James Dewille, respectively.) The result is solidly soapy, but feels like the dutiful   adaptation it is. Verdict? Unless you’re a watcher of the CW series  —   or have a feeling you might easily become one  —   this one’s skippable. Title: Star Trek: The Next Generation: Mirror Broken, Genre: Science   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Four samples from different new or ongoing Star Trek titles, led by a nifty little intro to the forthcoming Mirror Broken series, set in that mythos’ alternate reality, the Mirror Universe. It’s like the main universe, but more violent. And with a penchant for goatees. And for cinching the waist with kicky gold sashes that add a tres sportif visual pop, for trekking after 6:00. Another thing the Mirror Universe is all about, if J. K. Woodward’s art in this vignette is anything to go by: dumbbell curls. Lots and lots of dumbbell curls. Because this Picard? Is a sleeveless and seriously jacked Picard. Anything Else? Much shorter samples from: Boldly Go, the series set after the events of last year’s Star Trek: Beyond, the second Star   Lantern mashup miniseries, and Waypoint, which riffs on the series’ long history in many different ways. Verdict? I’m sorry . .. did you miss the word ”sleeveless” and ”jacked” and ”Picard” above? Because yes. Very, very yes. Title: Spill Night, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need to Know Going In? A prequel story to Scott Westerfield’s recently published graphic novel Spill Zone, about a mysterious event that destroys a small city in upstate New York. Like that book, this comic’s art is provided by Alex Puvilland. And also like that book, it’s pretty great. Anything Else? Westerfield’s story is moody, creepy, and wryly funny, but Puvilland’s art really shines here, especially when depicting the bizarre and unsettling ways the city is wholly changed by ”The Spill.” Verdict? A big yes. And I dare you not to pick up Spill Zone after reading this. Title: Steam Wars: Strike Leader, Genre:   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? Look, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, here’s all you need to know: ”Steampunk Star Wars.” There. Done. Because you either just made an involuntary   or you found yourself rolling your eyes. It’s instinctual. It’s your body, telling you whether or not to pick this one up. Anything Else? Also: British lady  . Verdict? Listen to your body. Title: Street Fighter V Wrestling Special, Genre: Crass Commercial      Anything I Need to Know Going In? Based on last year’s iteration of the venerable fighting game, this issue pits Dan Hibiki  —   sorry, that should read DAN HIBIKI!!  —   against most of the game’s female wrestling roster, including YOKO HARMAGEDDON! and A MAPLE STORM! (Canadian, attacks opponents with poutine) (seriously) and RAINBOW MIKAAAA! Also includes a brief story about a Haggar vs. Zangrief bout. Anything Else? The dialogue of that first story is just . .. sincerely fun. ”You filthy  ! Eat poo and die, Belger!” ”My eyes! They burn! The poutine buurns!” ”It’s game day,  !” ”RAGING DAN!” Verdict? Lookit, honest to god, no one’s more surprised than me, but . .. yes. Sorry, that should read . .. YYYYYESSSSS! Title: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  Genre: Science   Commercial   Anything I Need to Know Going In? After the Turtles spend a few pages helpfully reminding you of their long laundry list of foes  —   which reads like the comics equivalent of a sitcom clip show  —   their underground lair is attacked by a mysterious presence. Which, you have to admit, is cool, but rude. Anything Else? Nope that’s . .. that’s pretty much it. Verdict? Not essential, but if you’re curious about the current      lay of the land, pick it up. Title: Tex: Patagonia, Genre: (Spaghetti) Western, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Tex is a Western comic strip created in 1948, and it’s been published continuously ever since. So why haven’t you heard of it? Because it’s produced in Italy. Anything Else? This issue excerpts the forthcoming graphic novel, Tex: Patagonia. The storytelling, and the Hal   art, might feel a little   and there’s no getting away from its whole ”       ” premise, but it’s solidly constructed and gorgeously rendered. Verdict? Usually, FCBD selections include one or two issues of reprints of classic strips. Not this year, though. This isn’t that, but it’s close, so yeah, probably. Title: Wonder Woman, Genre: Superhero, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Greg Rucka’s run on Wonder Woman in the early 2000s is one of my favorites. She’s a character of contradictions  —   a Warrior for Peace  —   who’s tough to get right, and he did. He’s recently returned to the character, with art from Nicola Scott. This, DC’s FCBD selection, reprints the first issue of their current run. Anything Else? Yes, it’s another origin story, but there are some nice   as Rucka and Scott cut back and forth between Diana’s life on Themyscira and Steve Trevor’s in America. It’s as good a way as any to prep for the movie. Verdict? Sure. TEEN DON’  Title: I Hate Image, Genre: Humor, Anything I Need to Know Going In? Skottie Young’s I Hate Fairyland follows the adventures of young,   moppet Gert as she attempts to escape the magical realm she’s been trapped in for decades  —   by slaughtering its inhabitants. Adorably. The violence is cartoonish, but real  —   and Young is master of comic timing, character acting, and making the act of disemboweling seem . .. unsettlingly cute. In this issue, Gert makes her way to Image Land, where she cuts a bloody swath through the various characters from Image Comics titles like . .. well, that would spoil it. Anything Else? Free Comic Book Day isn’t meant for comics nerds. It’s pitched at   to give them their first taste of the medium. Consequently,     comics readers have historically had to content themselves with things like Fantagraphics’ FCBD reprints of   classic series to find something new and satisfying for themselves. Not this year. I Hate Image is aimed squarely at the comics cognoscenti. It’s packed with   and asides that will zip past readers who don’t know Image’s books  —   but, crucially, it won’t alienate those noobs.

"As a neonatal intensive care nurse, Lauren Bloomstein had been taking care of other people’s babies for years. Finally, at 33, she was expecting one of her own. The prospect of becoming a mother made her giddy, her husband, Larry, recalled recently —   ”the happiest and most alive I’d ever seen her.” When Lauren was 13, her own mother had died of a massive heart attack. Lauren had lived with her older brother for a while, then with a neighbor in Hazlet, N. J. who was like a surrogate mom, but in important ways she’d grown up mostly alone. The chance to create her own family, to be the mother she didn’t have, touched a place deep inside her. ”All she wanted to do was be loved,” said Frankie Hedges, who took Lauren in as a teenager and thought of her as her daughter. ”I think everybody loved her, but nobody loved her the way she wanted to be loved.” Other than some nausea in her first trimester, the pregnancy went smoothly. Lauren was ”tired in the beginning, achy in the end,” said Jackie Ennis, her best friend since high school, who talked to her at least once a day. ”She gained what she’s supposed to. She looked great, she felt good, she worked as much as she could”  —   at least three,   shifts a week until late into her ninth month. Larry, a doctor, helped monitor her blood pressure at home, and all was normal. On her days off she got organized, picking out strollers and car seats, stocking up on diapers and onesies. After one last   vacation to the Caribbean, she and Larry went hunting for their forever home, settling on a brick colonial with black shutters and a big yard in Moorestown, N. J. not far from his new job as an orthopedic trauma surgeon in Camden. Lauren wanted the baby’s gender to be a surprise, so when she set up the nursery she left the walls unpainted  —   she figured she’d have plenty of time to choose colors later. Despite all she knew about what could go wrong, she seemed untroubled by the normal   anxieties. Her only real worry was going into labor prematurely. ”You have to stay in there at least until 32 weeks,” she would tell her belly. ”I see how the babies do before 32. Just don’t come out too soon.” When she reached 39 weeks and six days  —   Friday, Sept. 30, 2011  —   Larry and Lauren drove to Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, the hospital where the two of them had met in 2004 and where she’d spent virtually her entire career. If anyone would watch out for her and her baby, Lauren figured, it would be the doctors and nurses she worked with on a daily basis. She was especially fond of her   who had trained as a resident at Monmouth at the same time as Larry. Lauren wasn’t having contractions, but she and the   agreed to schedule an induction of labor  —   he was on call that weekend and would be sure to handle the delivery himself. Inductions often go slowly, and Lauren’s labor stretched well into the next day. Ennis talked to her on the phone several times: ”She said she was feeling OK, she was just really uncomfortable.” At one point, Lauren was overcome by a sudden, sharp pain in her back near her kidneys or liver, but the nurses bumped up her epidural and the stabbing stopped. Inductions have been associated with higher   rates, but Lauren progressed well enough to deliver vaginally. On Saturday, Oct. 1, at 6:49 p. m. 23 hours after she checked into the hospital, Hailey Anne Bloomstein was born, weighing 5 pounds, 12 ounces. Larry and Lauren’s family had been camped out in the waiting room now they swarmed into the delivery area to ooh and aah, marveling at how Lauren seemed to glow. Larry floated around on his own cloud of euphoria, phone camera in hand. In one   video, Lauren holds their daughter on her chest, stroking her cheek with a practiced touch. Hailey is bundled in   pastels and flannel, unusually alert for a newborn she studies her mother’s face as if trying to make sense of a mystery that will never be solved. The delivery room staff bustles in the background in the   way of people who believe everything has gone exactly as it’s supposed to. Then Lauren looks directly at the camera, her eyes brimming. Twenty hours later, she was dead. ”We don’t pay enough attention”  The ability to protect the health of mothers and babies in childbirth is a basic measure of a society’s development. Yet every year in the U. S. 700 to 900 women die from pregnancy or   causes, and some 65, 000 nearly die  —   by many measures, the worst record in the developed world. American women are more than three times as likely as Canadian women to die in the maternal period (defined by the Centers for Disease Control as the start of pregnancy to one year after delivery or termination) six times as likely to die as Scandinavians. In every other wealthy country, and many less affluent ones, maternal mortality rates have been falling in Great Britain, the journal Lancet recently noted, the rate has declined so dramatically that ”a man is more likely to die while his partner is pregnant than she is.” But in the U. S. maternal deaths increased from 2000 to 2014. In a recent analysis by the CDC Foundation, nearly 60 percent of such deaths are preventable. While maternal mortality is significantly more common among     women and in rural areas, pregnancy and childbirth complications kill women of every race and ethnicity, education and income level, in every part of the U. S. ProPublica and NPR spent the last several months scouring social media and other sources, ultimately identifying more than 450 expectant and new mothers who have died since 2011. The list includes teachers, insurance brokers, homeless women, journalists, a spokeswoman for Yellowstone National Park, a   of the YouTube channel WhatsUpMoms, and more than a dozen doctors and nurses like Lauren Bloomstein. They died from cardiomyopathy and other heart problems, massive hemorrhage, blood clots, infections and   hypertension (preeclampsia) as well as rarer causes. Many died days or weeks after leaving the hospital. Maternal mortality is commonplace enough that three new mothers who died, including Lauren, were cared for by the same  . The reasons for higher maternal mortality in the U. S. are manifold. New mothers are older than they used to be, with more complex medical histories. Half of pregnancies in the U. S. are unplanned, so many women don’t address chronic health issues beforehand. Greater prevalence of   leads to more   complications. The fragmented health system makes it harder for new mothers, especially those without good insurance, to get the care they need. Confusion about how to recognize worrisome symptoms and treat obstetric emergencies makes caregivers more prone to error. Yet the worsening U. S. maternal mortality numbers contrast sharply with the impressive progress in saving babies’ lives. Infant mortality has fallen to its lowest point in history, the CDC reports, reflecting 50 years of efforts by the public health community to prevent birth defects, reduce preterm birth, and improve outcomes for very premature infants. The number of babies who die annually in the U. S.  —   about 23, 000 in 2014  —   still greatly exceeds the number of expectant and new mothers who die, but the ratio is narrowing. The divergent trends for mothers and babies highlight a theme that has emerged repeatedly in ProPublica’s and NPR’s reporting. In recent decades, under the assumption that it had conquered maternal mortality, the American medical system has focused more on fetal and infant safety and survival than on the mother’s health and  . ”We worry a lot about vulnerable little babies,” said Barbara Levy, vice president for health   at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and a member of the Council on Patient Safety in Women’s Health Care. Meanwhile, ”we don’t pay enough attention to those things that can be catastrophic for women.” At the federally funded   Medicine Units Network, the preeminent obstetric research collaborative in the U. S. only four of the 34 initiatives listed in its online database primarily target mothers, versus 24 aimed at improving outcomes for infants (the remainder address both). Under the Title V   program supporting maternal and child health, states devoted about 6 percent of block grants in 2016 to programs for mothers, compared to 78 percent for infants and   children. The notion that babies deserve more care than mothers is similarly enshrined in the Medicaid program, which pays for about 45 percent of births. In many states, the program covers moms for 60 days postpartum, their infants for a full year. The bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, adopted by the U. S. House of Representatives earlier this month, could gut Medicaid for mothers and babies alike. At the provider level, advances in technology have widened the gap between maternal and fetal and infant care. ”People became really enchanted with the ability to do ultrasound, and then   ultrasound, to do invasive procedures, to stick needles in the amniotic cavity,” said William Callaghan chief of the CDC’s Maternal and Infant Health Branch. The growing specialty of   medicine drifted so far toward care of the fetus that as recently as 2012, young doctors who wanted to work in the field didn’t have to spend time learning to care for birthing mothers. ”The training was quite variable across the U. S.,” said Mary D’Alton, chair of   at Columbia University Medical Center and author of papers on disparities in care for mothers and infants. ”There were some fellows that could finish their   medicine training without ever being in a labor and delivery unit.” In the last decade or so, at least 20 hospitals have established multidisciplinary fetal care centers for babies at high risk for a variety of problems. So far, only one hospital in the U. S.  —       —   has a similar program for     . In regular maternity wards, too, babies are monitored more closely than mothers during and after birth, maternal health advocates told ProPublica and NPR. Newborns in the slightest danger are whisked off to neonatal intensive care units like the one Lauren Bloomstein worked at, staffed by highly trained specialists ready for the worst, while their mothers are tended by nurses and doctors who expect things to be fine and are often unprepared when they aren’t. When women are discharged, they routinely receive information about how to   and what to do if their newborn is sick but not necessarily how to tell if they need medical attention themselves. ”It was only when I had my own child that I realized, ’Oh my goodness. That was completely insufficient information,’” said Elizabeth Howell, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ”The way that we’ve been trained, we do not give women enough information for them to manage their health postpartum. The focus had always been on babies and not on mothers.” In 2009, the Joint Commission, which accredits 21, 000 health care facilities in the U. S. adopted a series of perinatal ”core measures”  —   national standards that have been shown to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. Four of the measures are aimed at making sure the baby is healthy. One  —   bringing down the   rate  —   addresses maternal health. Meanwhile,   practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries  —   and in a few states, notably California  —   have yet to take hold in many American hospitals. Take the example of preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that occurs only in pregnancy or the postpartum period, and can lead to seizures and strokes. Around the world, it kills an estimated five women an hour. But in developed countries, it is highly treatable. The key is to act quickly. By standardizing its approach, Britain has reduced preeclampsia deaths to one in a million  —   a total of two deaths from 2012 to 2014. In the U. S. on the other hand, preeclampsia still accounts for about 8 percent of maternal deaths —   50 to 70 women a year. Including Lauren Bloomstein. ”I cannot remember too many health care employees that I respect as much as Lauren” When Lauren McCarthy Bloomstein was a teenager in the 1990s, a neighbor who worked for a New York publishing firm approached her about modeling for a series of books based on Louisa May Alcott’s classic Little Women. Since her mother’s death, Lauren had become solitary and shy she loved to read, but she decided she wasn’t interested. ”Are you kidding? Go do it!” Frankie Hedges insisted. ”That would be fabulous!” Lauren relented, and the publisher cast her as the eldest March sister, Meg. She appeared on the covers of four books, looking very much the proper   young lady with her long brown hair parted neatly down the middle and a string of pearls around her neck. The determined expression on her face, though, was pure Lauren. ”She didn’t want sympathy, she didn’t want pity,” Jackie Ennis said. ”She wasn’t one to talk much about her feelings [about] her mom. She looked at it as this is what she was dealt and she’s gonna do everything in her power to become a productive person.” In high school, Lauren decided her path lay in nursing, and she chose a   program at Brookdale Community College. She worked at a doctor’s office to earn money for tuition and lived in the garage apartment that Hedges and her husband had converted especially for her, often helping out with their young twin sons. Lauren ”wasn’t a real mushy person,” Hedges said. ”She wasn’t the type to say things like ’I love you. ’” But she clearly relished being part of a family again. ”You can’t believe how happy she is,” Ennis once told Hedges. ”We’ll be out and she’ll say, ’Oh, I have to go home for dinner! ’” After graduating in 2002, Lauren landed at Monmouth Medical Center, a sprawling   complex a few minutes from the ocean that is part of the RWJBarnabas Health system and a teaching affiliate of Philadelphia’s Drexel University College of Medicine. Her first job was in the medical surgical unit, where her clinical skills and work ethic soon won accolades. ”I cannot remember too many health care employees that I respect as much as Lauren,” Diane Stanaway, then Monmouth’s clinical director of nursing, wrote in a 2005 commendation. ”What a dynamite young lady and nurse!” When a top hospital executive needed surgery, Larry recalled, he paid Lauren the ultimate compliment, picking her as one of two   nurses to help oversee his care. Larry Bloomstein, who joined the unit as an orthopedic surgical resident in 2004, was dazzled, too. He liked her independent streak  —   ”she didn’t feel the need to rely on anyone else for anything”  —   and her  . Even performing CPR on a dying patient, Lauren ”had a calmness about her,” Larry said. He thought her tough upbringing ”gave her a sense of confidence. She didn’t seem to worry about small things.” Lauren, meanwhile, told Ennis, ”I met this guy. He’s a doctor, and he’s very kind.” Their first date was a Bruce Springsteen concert five years later they married on Long Beach Island, on the Jersey shore. One of Lauren’s favorite books was Catcher in the Rye  —   ”she related to the Holden Caulfield character rescuing kids,” Larry said. When a spot opened at Monmouth’s elite neonatal intensive care unit in 2006, she jumped at it. The hospital has the   maternity department in the state, delivering 5, 449 babies in 2016. Monmouth earned an ”A” grade from Leapfrog, a nonprofit that promotes safety in health care, and met full safety standards in critical areas of maternity care, such as rates of   and early elective deliveries, a hospital spokeswoman said. Its NICU, a Level III facility for   newborns, is the oldest in New Jersey. ”With NICU nursing, it’s one of those things either you get it or you don’t,” said Katy DiBernardo, a   veteran of the unit. ”The babies are little, and a lot of people aren’t used to seeing a teeny tiny baby.” The NICU staff included nurses, neonatologists, a respiratory therapist, and residents. Lauren, DiBernardo said, ”just clicked.” One of the things Lauren liked best about her work was the bonds she formed with babies’ families. Nurses followed the same newborns throughout their stay, sometimes for weeks or months. She was a touchstone for parents  —   very good at ”calming people down who have a lot of anxiety,” Larry said  —   and often stayed in contact long after the babies went home, meeting the moms for coffee and even babysitting on occasion. She also cherished the deep friendships that a place like the NICU forged. The neonatal floor was like a world unto itself, Lauren Byron, another   nurse there, explained: ”There’s a lot of stress and pressure, and you are in    situations. You develop a very close relationship with some people.” The environment tended to attract very strong personalities. Lauren’s nickname in the Bloomstein family football pool was ”The Feisty One,” so she fit right in. But she could stand her ground without alienating anyone. ”She was one of those people that everyone liked,” Byron said. ”We save more than we lose” Another person everyone liked was   John Vaclavik. He had come to Monmouth as a resident in 2004, around the same time as Larry, after earning his bachelor’s from Loyola College in Baltimore and his medical degree at St. George’s University on the island of Grenada. Medicine was the family profession: two uncles and two brothers also became doctors and his wife was a perinatal social worker at the hospital. Lauren and her colleagues thought he was ”very personable” and ”a great guy,” Larry said. ”She was good friends with my wife and she felt comfortable with me,” Vaclavik would recall in a 2015 court deposition. After his residency, Vaclavik joined Ocean Obstetric  Gynecologic Associates, a thriving practice that counted numerous medical professionals among its clients. Vaclavik was a ”laborist”  —   part of a movement that aimed to reduce the number of   which tend to have more difficult recoveries and more complications than vaginal births. In a state with a   rate of 37 percent, Monmouth’s rate in 2016 was just 21 percent. The neonatal nurses had plenty of opportunity to observe Vaclavik and other   in action  —   someone from NICU was called to attend every delivery that showed signs of being complicated or unusual as well as every  . ”We always laughed, ’They’ll call us for a hangnail,’” DiBernardo said. Lauren was so impressed by Vaclavik that she not only chose him as her own doctor, she recommended him to her best friend. ”She kept saying, ’You have to go to this guy. He’s a good doctor. Good doctor,’” Ennis said. In other ways, though, the NICU staff and the labor and delivery staff were very separate. The neonatal nurses were focused on their own fragile patients  —   the satisfaction that came from helping them grow strong enough to go home, the grief when that didn’t happen. Once Ennis asked Lauren, ”How do you deal with babies that don’t make it? That’s got to be so bad.” Lauren replied, ”Yeah, but we save more than we lose.” Loss was less common in labor and delivery, and when a new mother suffered   complications, the news did not always reach the NICU floor. Thus, when a    special education teacher named Tara Hansen contracted a grisly infection a few days after giving birth to her first child in March 2011, the tragedy didn’t register with Lauren, who was then three months pregnant herself. Hansen lived in nearby Freehold, N. J. with her husband, Ryan, her high school sweetheart. Her pregnancy, like Lauren’s, had been textbook perfect and she delivered a healthy   son. But Hansen suffered tearing near her vagina during childbirth. She developed signs of infection but was discharged anyway, a lawsuit by her husband later alleged. Hansen was soon readmitted to Monmouth with what the lawsuit called ”excruciating, severe pain beyond the capacity of a human being to endure.” The diagnosis was necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as   bacteria two days later Hansen was dead. One of Vaclavik’s colleagues delivered Hansen’s baby Vaclavik himself authorized her discharge. According to court documents, he said nurses failed to inform him about Hansen’s symptoms and that if he’d known her vital signs weren’t stable, he wouldn’t have released her. The hospital and nurses eventually settled for $1. 5 million. The suit against Vaclavik and his colleagues is pending.   Vaclavik did not respond to several interview requests from ProPublica and NPR, including an emailed list of questions. ”Due to the fact this matter is in litigation,” his attorney responded, ”Dr. Vaclavik respectfully declines to comment.”   Citing patient privacy, Monmouth spokeswoman Elizabeth Brennan also declined to discuss specific cases. ”We are saddened by the grief these families have experienced from their loss,” she said in a statement. ”I don’t feel good” Larry Bloomstein’s first inkling that something was seriously wrong with Lauren came about 90 minutes after she gave birth. He had accompanied Hailey up to the nursery to be weighed and measured and given the usual barrage of tests for newborns. Lauren hadn’t eaten since breakfast, but he returned to find her dinner tray untouched. ”I don’t feel good,” she told him. She pointed to a spot above her abdomen and just below her sternum, close to where she’d felt the stabbing sensation during labor. ”I’ve got pain that’s coming back.” Larry had been at Lauren’s side much of the previous 24 hours. Conscious that his role was husband rather than doctor, he had tried not to overstep. Now, though, he pressed Vaclavik: What was the matter with his wife? ”He was like, ’I see this a lot. We do a lot of belly surgery. This is definitely reflux,’” Larry recalled. According to Lauren’s records, the   ordered an antacid called Bicitra and an opioid painkiller called Dilaudid. Lauren vomited them up. Lauren’s pain was soon 10 on a scale of 10, she told Larry and the nurses so excruciating, the nurses noted, ”Patient [is] unable to stay still.” Just as ominously, her blood pressure was spiking. An hour after Hailey’s birth, the reading was   an hour after that,  . At her final prenatal appointment, her reading had been just  . Obstetrics wasn’t Larry’s specialty, but he knew enough to ask the nurse: Could this be preeclampsia? Preeclampsia, or   hypertension, is a   condition that affects 3 percent to 5 percent of expectant or new mothers in the U. S. up to 200, 000 women a year. It can strike anyone out of the blue, though the risk is higher for   women with   conditions such as obesity, diabetes or kidney disease, and mothers over the age of 40. It is most common during the second half of pregnancy, but can develop in the days or weeks after childbirth, and can become very dangerous very quickly. Because a traditional treatment for preeclampsia is to deliver as soon as possible, the babies are often premature and end up in NICUs like the one where Lauren worked. As Larry suspected, Lauren’s blood pressure readings were well past the danger point. What he didn’t know was that they’d been abnormally high since she entered the hospital  —     according to her admissions paperwork. During labor, she had 21 systolic readings at or above 140 and 13 diastolic readings at or above 90, her records indicated for a stretch of almost eight hours, her blood pressure wasn’t monitored at all, the New Jersey Department of Health later found. Over that same period, her baby’s vital signs were being constantly watched, Larry said. In his court deposition, Vaclavik described the   reading as ”elevated” compared to her usual readings, but not abnormal. He ”would use 180 over 110 as a cutoff” to suspect preeclampsia, he said. Still, he acknowledged, Lauren’s blood pressure ”might have been recommended to be monitored more closely, in retrospect.” Leading medical organizations in the U. S. and the U. K. take a different view. They advise that increases to   for pregnant women with no previous history of high blood pressure signify preeclampsia. When systolic readings hit 160, treatment with   drugs and magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures ”should be initiated ASAP,” according to guidelines from the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health. When other symptoms, such as upper abdominal (epigastric) pain, are present, the situation is considered even more urgent.  This basic approach isn’t new: ”Core Curriculum for   Nursing,” a widely used textbook, outlined it in 1997. Yet failure to diagnose preeclampsia, or to differentiate it from chronic high blood pressure, is all too common. California researchers who studied preeclampsia deaths over several years found one striking theme: ”Despite triggers that clearly indicated a serious deterioration in the patient’s condition, health care providers failed to recognize and respond to these signs in a timely manner, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.” Preeclampsia symptoms  —   swelling and rapid weight gain, gastric discomfort and vomiting, headache and anxiety  —   are often mistaken for the normal irritations that crop up during pregnancy or after giving birth. ”We don’t have a   test for it,” said Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the Preeclampsia Foundation. ”A lot of physicians don’t necessarily see a lot of it.” Outdated notions  —   for example, that delivering the baby cures the condition  —   unfamiliarity with best practices and lack of crisis preparation can further hinder the response. The fact that Lauren gave birth over the weekend may also have worked against her. Hospitals may be staffed differently on weekends, adding to the challenges of managing a crisis. A new Baylor College of Medicine analysis of 45 million pregnancies in the U. S. from 2004 to 2014 found mothers who deliver on Saturday or Sunday have nearly 50 percent higher mortality rates as well as more blood transfusions and more perineal tearing. The ”weekend effect” has also been associated with higher fatality rates from heart attacks, strokes and head trauma. According to Lauren’s records, Vaclavik did order a preeclampsia lab test around 8:40 p. m. but a nurse noted a   later: ”No abnormal labs present.” (According to Larry, the results were borderline.) Larry began pushing to call in a specialist. Vaclavik attributed Lauren’s pain to esophagitis, or inflammation of the esophagus, which had afflicted her before, he said in his deposition. Around 10 p. m. according to Lauren’s medical records, he phoned the   gastroenterologist, who ordered an   and additional tests, more Dilaudid and different antacids  —   Maalox and Protonix. Nothing helped. Meanwhile, Larry decided to reach out to his own colleagues in the trauma unit at Cooper University Hospital in Camden. In his training, perhaps the most important lesson he’d learned was to ask for help: ”If there’s a problem, I will immediately get another physician involved.” By chance, the doctor on call happened to be a fairly new mother. As Larry described Lauren’s symptoms, she interrupted him. ”You can stop talking. I know what this is.” She said Lauren had HELLP syndrome, an acronym for the most severe variation of preeclampsia, characterized by hemolysis, or the breakdown of red blood cells elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count, a clotting deficiency that can lead to excessive bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Larry’s colleague urged him to stop wasting time, he recalled. Lauren’s very high blood pressure, the vomiting, and the terrible pain radiating from her kidneys and liver were symptoms of rapid deterioration. ”Your wife’s in a lot of danger,” the trauma doctor said. (She didn’t respond to ProPublica’s and NPR’s requests for comment.) ”It’s never just one thing” Earlier this year, an analysis by the CDC Foundation of maternal mortality data from four states identified more than 20 ”critical factors” that contributed to   deaths. Among the ones involving providers: lack of standardized policies, inadequate clinical skills, failure to consult specialists and poor coordination of care. The average maternal death had 3. 7 critical factors. ”It’s never just one thing,” said Roberta Gold, a member of the Council on Patient Safety in Women’s Health Care, whose daughter and unborn grandson died from a   blood clot in 2010. ”It’s always a cascading combination of things. It’s a   train wreck.” The last 16 hours of Lauren’s life were consistent with that grim pattern. Distressed by what the trauma doctor had told him, Larry immediately went to Lauren’s caregivers. But they insisted the tests didn’t show preeclampsia, he said. Not long after, Larry’s colleague called back to check on Lauren’s condition. ”I don’t believe those labs,” he recalls her telling him. ”They can’t be right. I’m positive of my diagnosis. Do them again. ’” Meanwhile, Lauren’s agony had become almost unendurable. The blood pressure cuff on her arm was adding to her discomfort, so around 10:30 p. m. her nurse decided to remove it  —   on the theory, Larry said, ”We know her blood pressure is high. There’s no point to retaking it.” According to Lauren’s records, her blood pressure went unmonitored for another hour and 44 minutes. Larry had given up on getting a specialist to come to the hospital so late on a Saturday night, but he persuaded Vaclavik to call in a general surgical resident. Around 11:55 p. m. according to the nurses’ notes, Lauren begged, ”Do anything to stop this pain.” Vaclavik prescribed morphine, to little effect. Just after midnight, her blood pressure about to peak at   Lauren began complaining of a headache. As Larry studied his wife’s face, he realized something had changed. ”She suddenly looks really calm and comfortable, like she’s trying to go to sleep.” She gave Larry a little smile, but only the right side of her mouth moved. In an instant, Larry’s alarm turned to panic. He ordered Lauren, ”Lift your hands for me.” Only her right arm fluttered. He peeled off her blankets and scraped the soles of her feet with his fingernail, testing her   Babinski reflex in an adult whose brain is working normally, the big toe automatically jerks downward. Lauren’s right toe curled as it was supposed to. But her left toe stuck straight out, unmoving. As Larry was examining her, Lauren suddenly seemed to realize what was happening to her. ”She looked at me and said, ’I’m afraid,’ and, ’I love you.’ And I’m pretty sure in that moment she put the pieces together. That she had a conscious awareness of . .. that she was not going to make it.” A CT scan soon confirmed the worst: The escalating blood pressure had triggered bleeding in her brain.   hemorrhagic strokes tend to be deadlier than those caused by blood clots. Surgery can sometimes save the patient’s life, but only if it is performed quickly.  Larry was a realist he knew that even the   scenario was devastating. Chances were that Lauren would be paralyzed or partially paralyzed. She’d never be the mother she had dreamed of being. She’d never be a nurse again. But at least there was a chance she would live. When the neurologist arrived, Larry asked, ”Is there hope here?” As he recalls it, the neurologist responded, ”That’s why I’m here. There’s hope.” Larry began gathering Lauren’s loved ones  —   his parents, her brother, Frankie Hedges and her husband Billy, Jackie Ennis. On the phone, he tried to play down the gravity of the situation, but everyone understood. When Larry’s mother arrived, the hospital entrance was locked, and Larry and Vaclavik came to meet her. ”The obstetrician just said, ’She’s going to be all right,’” Linda Bloomstein said. ”And Larry was standing behind him, and I saw the tears coming down, and he was shaking his head, ’No. ’” Around 2 a. m. the neurosurgeon finally confirmed what the trauma doctor had said four hours before: Lauren had HELLP syndrome. Then he delivered more bad news: Her blood platelets  —   essential to stopping the hemorrhage  —   were dangerously low. But, according to Larry, the hospital didn’t have sufficient platelets on site, so her surgery would have to be delayed. Larry was dumbfounded. How could a regional medical center that delivered babies and performed all types of surgery not have platelets on hand for an emergency? Vaclavik called the Red Cross and other facilities, pleading with them to send any they had. ”In my understanding, there was a complete shortage of platelets in the state of New Jersey,” he said in the deposition. Hours passed before the needed platelets arrived. The neuro team did another CT scan around 6 a. m. Larry couldn’t bring himself to look at it, ”but from what they’ve told me, it was horrifically worse.” While Lauren was in surgery, friends began dropping by, hoping to see her and the baby, not realizing what had happened since her cheerful texts the night before. Around 12:30 p. m. the neurosurgeon emerged and confirmed that brain activity had stopped. Lauren was on life support, with no chance of recovery. All this time, Hailey had been in the newborn nursery, being tended by Lauren’s stunned colleagues. They brought her down to Lauren’s room and Larry placed her gently into her mother’s arms. After a few minutes, the nurses whisked the baby back up to the third floor to protect her from germs. A respiratory therapist carefully removed the breathing tube from Lauren’s mouth. At 3:08 p. m. surrounded by her loved ones, she died. A private tragedy, In the U. S. unlike some other developed countries, maternal deaths are treated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health catastrophe. A death in childbirth may be mourned on Facebook or memorialized on GoFundMe, but it is rarely reported in the news. Most obituaries, Lauren’s included, don’t mention how a mother died. Lauren’s passing was more public than most, eliciting an outpouring of grief. Hundreds of people attended her wake and funeral  —   doctors and nurses from the hospital, friends from around the country, families Lauren had taken care of. Vaclavik was there, utterly devastated, Larry’s family said. The head of Monmouth’s   department paid his respects and, according to Larry, promised in a private conversation at the wake to conduct a full investigation. In the days after Lauren’s death, Larry couldn’t dwell on the implications of what had happened. He had to find a burial plot, choose a casket, write a eulogy. He was too shattered to return to the Mooresville house, so he took Hailey to his parents’ place, a   apartment they were renting while they renovated their home, and slept with the baby in the living room for the first month. After the funeral, he turned all his attention to his daughter. He knew nothing about newborns, always imagining Lauren would teach him  —   ”What could be better than having your own NICU nurse to take care of your baby?” he had thought. He relied on his mother and sister and Lauren’s friends to guide him. He took time off from his job at Cooper, figuring three months would be enough. But as his return date approached, he knew he wasn’t ready. ”I don’t think I can see a patient that’s on a ventilator right now,” he realized. ”Or even just a hospital bed.” He didn’t want to leave Hailey. So he quit. He sold the house, though he couldn’t bring himself to attend the closing  —   ”I couldn’t stand handing those keys over to someone else.” He took Hailey a couple of times to stay with his sister and her family in Texas, where he didn’t have to answer the constant questions. But traveling with his baby daughter was painful in its own way. People didn’t know what to make of him. ”It’s strange for people to see a father alone,” he said. Wherever he went, he felt disconnected from almost everything around him: ”You’re walking around this world and all these people are around you, and they’re going on with their lives and I just felt very, very isolated and very alone with that.” Back in New Jersey, Larry found a job closer to his parents’ place, performed one operation and tried to quit. His new employers, though, persuaded him to stay. To avoid reliving the funeral, he returned to Texas for the first anniversary of Hailey’s birth and Lauren’s death in late September 2012. In one of his suitcases, he packed a giant cupcake mold Lauren had bought when they first married  —   she thought it would make a perfect   cake for the kids she yearned for. He baked the cake himself  —   chocolate, Lauren’s favorite, covered with sprinkles. ”With our technology, every single time a woman dies, it’s a medical error” Other people in Lauren’s and Larry’s circle had been asking questions about her care since the night she died. ”That was the first thing I literally said when I walked [into the hospital]  —   I said, ’How did this happen? ’” Jackie Ennis recalled. In the next week or two, she probed Larry again: ”’Did they do everything they could for her? ’” He said, ’No, there were warning signs for hours before. ’” Ennis was too upset to dig any deeper. As Larry’s numbness wore off, his orthopedist friends began pushing him as well. Larry was hesitant despite the missteps he had witnessed, part of him wanted to believe that Lauren’s death had been unavoidable. ”And my friends were like, ’We can’t accept that . .. With our technology, every single time a woman dies [in childbirth] it’s a medical error. ’” Lauren’s death, Larry finally admitted to himself, could not be dismissed as either inevitable or a fluke. He had seen how Lauren’s   and nurses had failed to recognize a textbook case of one of the most common complications of pregnancy  —   not once, but repeatedly over two days. To Larry, the fact that someone with Lauren’s advantages could die so needlessly was symptomatic of a bigger problem. By some measures, New Jersey had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U. S. He wanted authorities to get to the root of it  —   to push the people and institutions that were at fault to change. That’s the approach in the United Kingdom, where maternal deaths are regarded as systems failures. A national committee of experts scrutinizes every death of a woman from pregnancy or childbirth complications, collecting medical records and assessments from caregivers, conducting rigorous analyses of the data, and publishing reports that help set policy for hospitals throughout the country. Coroners also sometimes hold public inquests, forcing hospitals and their staffs to answer for their mistakes. The U. K. process is largely responsible for the stunning reduction in preeclampsia deaths in Britain, the committee noted its 2016 report  —   ”a clear success story” that it hoped to repeat ”across other medical and mental health causes of maternal death.” The U. S. has no comparable federal effort. Instead, maternal mortality reviews are left up to states. As of this spring, 26 states (and one city, Philadelphia) had a   process in place another five states had committees that were less than a year old. In almost every case, resources are tight, the reviews take years, and the findings get little attention. A bipartisan bill in Congress, the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2017, would authorize funding for states to establish review panels or improve their processes. New Jersey’s review team, the   in the U. S. includes   nurses, mental health specialists, medical examiners, even a nutritionist. Using vital records and other reports, they identify every woman in New Jersey who died within a year of pregnancy or childbirth, from any cause, then review medical and other records to determine whether the death was ” ” or not. Every few years, the committee publishes a report, focusing on things like the race and age of the mothers who died, the causes of death, and other demographic and health data. In the past, the findings have been used to promote policies to reduce postpartum depression. But the New Jersey committee doesn’t interview the relatives of the deceased, nor does it assess whether a death was preventable. Moreover, like every other state that conducts such reviews, New Jersey ” ” the records  —   strips them of any information that might point to an individual hospital or a particular woman. Otherwise, the medical community and lawmakers would refuse to go along. The goal is to ”improve care for patients in general,” said Joseph Apuzzio, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at   Jersey Medical School who heads the committee. This requires a process that is ”nonjudgmental” and ”not punitive,” he said. ”That’s the best way to get a free discussion of all of the health care providers who are in the room.” Yet the result of   as Larry soon realized, is that the review is of little use in assigning responsibility for individual deaths, or evaluating whether some hospitals, doctors or nurses are more prone to error than others. To Larry, this seemed like a critical oversight  —   or perhaps, willful denial. In a preventable death or other medical error, he said, sometimes the who and the where are as important as the why. ”Unless someone points the finger specifically,” he said, ”I think the actual cause [of the problem] is lost.” ”The facility is not in compliance” Someone eventually steered Larry toward the New Jersey Department of Health’s licensing and inspection division, which oversees hospital and   safety. He filed a complaint against Monmouth Medical Center in 2012. The DOH examined Lauren’s records, interviewed her caregivers and scrutinized Monmouth’s policies and practices. In December 2012 it issued a report that backed up everything Larry had seen  . ”There is no record in the medical record that the Registered Nurse notified [the  ] of the elevated blood pressures of patient prior to delivery,” investigators found. And: ”There is no evidence in the medical record of further evaluation and surveillance of patient from [the  ] prior to delivery.” And: ”There was no evidence in the medical record that the elevated blood pressures were addressed by [the  ] until after the Code Stroke was called.” The report faulted the hospital. ”The facility is not in compliance” with New Jersey hospital licensing standards, it concluded. ”The facility failed to ensure that recommended obstetrics guidelines are adhered to by staff.” To address these criticisms, Monmouth Medical Center had implemented a plan of correction, also contained in the report. The plan called for a mandatory educational program for all labor and delivery nurses about preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome staff training in Advance Life Support Obstetrics and Critical Care Obstetrics and more training on the use of   methods to assess patients and improve communications between caregivers. Some of the changes were strikingly basic: ”Staff nurses were educated regarding the necessity of reviewing, when available, or obtaining the patients [sic] prenatal records. Education identified that they must make a comparison of the prenatal blood pressure against the initial admission blood pressure.” And: ”Repeat vital signs will be obtained every 4 hours at a minimum.” An important part of the plan of correction involved Vaclavik, though neither he nor the nurses were identified by name. The head of Monmouth’s   department provided ”professional remediation for the identified physician,” the Department of Health report said. In addition, there was ”monitoring of 100% of records for physician of record per month x 3 months.” The monitoring focused on ”compliance of timely physician intervention for elevated blood   assessment and management.” The department chairman, Robert Graebe, found Vaclavik’s charts to be 100 percent compliant, Vaclavik said in the deposition. Graebe was asked in a March 2017 deposition if Vaclavik was in good standing at the hospital at the time of Lauren’s treatment. ”Was and is,” Graebe replied. In a separate note, the Department of Health told Larry that it forwarded his complaint to the Board of Medical Examiners and the New Jersey Board of Nursing. Neither agency has taken disciplinary action, according to their websites. Larry’s copy of the DOH report arrived in the mail. He was gratified by the findings but dismayed that they weren’t publicly posted. That meant hardly anyone would see them. A few months after the DOH weighed in, he sued Monmouth, Vaclavik and five nurses in Monmouth County Superior Court in Freehold, N. J. For a medical malpractice lawsuit to go forward in New Jersey, an expert must certify that it has merit. Larry’s passed muster with an  . But beyond the taking of depositions, there’s been little action in the case. Creating ”toolkits” As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U. S. a small cadre of reformers has mobilized. Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California, where more babies are born than in any other state  —  500, 000 a year,   of the U. S. total. Modeled on the U. K. process, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by the experiences of founder Elliott Main, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of   Francisco, who for many years ran the   department at a San Francisco hospital. ”One of my saddest moments as an obstetrician was a woman with severe preeclampsia that we thought we had done everything correct, who still had a major stroke and we could not save her,” he said recently. That loss has weighed on him for 20 years. ”When you’ve had a maternal death, you remember it for the rest of your life. All the details.” Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also   complications and racial disparities in obstetric care. It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years in almost every case, it discovered, there was ”at least some chance to alter the outcome.” The most preventable deaths were from hemorrhage (70 percent) and preeclampsia (60 percent). Main and his colleagues then began creating a series of ”toolkits” to help doctors and nurses improve their handling of emergencies. The first one, targeting obstetric bleeding, recommended things like ”hemorrhage carts” for storing medications and supplies, crisis protocols for massive transfusions, and regular training and drills. Instead of the common practice of ” ” blood loss, which often leads to underestimating the seriousness of a hemorrhage and delaying treatment, nurses learned to collect and weigh postpartum blood to get precise measurements. Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a 21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year hospitals that didn’t use the protocol had a 1. 2 percent reduction. By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100, 000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands  —   a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U. S. ”Prevention isn’t a magic pill,” Main said. ”It’s actually teamwork [and having] a structured, organized, standardized approach” to care. CMQCC’s preeclampsia toolkit, launched in 2014, emphasized the kind of practices that might have saved Lauren Bloomstein: careful monitoring of blood pressure and early and aggressive treatment with magnesium sulfate and   medications. Data on its effectiveness hasn’t been published. The collaborative’s work has inspired ACOG and advocates in a few states to create their own initiatives. Much of the funding has come from a   $500 million maternal health initiative by Merck, the pharmaceutical giant. Originally intended to focus on less developed countries, Merck for Mothers decided it couldn’t ignore the growing problem in the U. S. The U. S. maternal mortality rate is ”unacceptable,” said executive director   Etiebet. Making pregnancy and childbirth safer ”will not only save women’s lives but will improve and strengthen our health systems . .. for all.” But the really hard work is only beginning. According to the Institute of Medicine, it takes an average of 17 years for a new medical protocol to be widely adopted. Even in California, half of the 250 hospitals that deliver babies still aren’t using the toolkits, said Main, who largely blames inertia. In New York State, some hospitals have questioned the need for what they call ”cookbook medicine,” said Columbia’s D’Alton. Her response: ”Variability is the enemy of safety. Rather than have 10 different approaches to obstetric hemorrhage or treatment of hypertension, choose one or two and make it consistent . .. When we do things in a standardized way, we have better outcomes.” One big hurdle: training. Another: money. Smaller providers, in particular, may not see the point. ”It’s very hard to get a hospital to provide resources to change something that they don’t see as a problem,” ACOG’s Barbara Levy said. ”If they haven’t had a maternal death because they only deliver 500 babies a year, how many years is it going to be before they see a severe problem? It may be 10 years.” In New Jersey, providers don’t need as much convincing, thanks to a recent project to reduce postpartum blood loss led by the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. A number of hospitals saw improvements at one, the average length of a   ICU stay plunged from 8 days to 1. 5 days. But only 31 of the state’s 52 birthing hospitals participated in the effort, in part  —   perhaps  —   because nurses led it, said Robyn D’Oria, executive director of the Central Jersey Family Health Consortium and member of the state’s maternal mortality committee. ”I remember having a conversation with [someone from] a hospital that I would describe as progressive and she said to me, ’I cannot get past some of the physicians not wanting to buy into this. ’” So New Jersey hospitals are about to try again, this time adopting   created by the   Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health for hemorrhage and preeclampsia. ”We’re at the very beginning” of a   that is likely to take at least two years, D’Oria said. Among those helping create momentum has been Ryan Hansen, the husband of the teacher who died at Monmouth Medical Center a few months before Lauren Bloomstein. Still, as hospitals begin to revamp, mothers in the state continue to perish. One was Ashley Heaney Butler. A Rutgers University graduate, she lived in Bayville, where she decorated the walls of her house with anchors, reflecting her passion for the ocean. She worked for the state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services as a counselor, and served as president of the New Jersey Rehabilitation Association. Her husband Joseph was a firefighter. She gave birth at Monmouth last September to a healthy boy and died a couple of weeks later at the age of 31, never leaving the hospital. It turned out that she had developed an infection late in her pregnancy, possibly related to a prior gastric bypass surgery. She was under the care of several doctors, including Vaclavik. ”She didn’t get what she deserved” The sudden death of a new mother is tragic to everyone around her. ”When you take that one death and what that does, not only to the husband, but to the family and to the community, the impact that it has in the hospital, on the staff, on everybody that’s cared for her, on all the people who knew them, it has ripple effects for generations to come,” Robyn D’Oria said. Jackie Ennis felt Lauren’s loss as an absence of phone calls. She and Lauren had been closer than many sisters, talking several times a day. Sometimes Lauren called just to say she was really tired and would talk later she’d even called Ennis from Hawaii on her honeymoon. The night Lauren died, Ennis knew something was wrong because she hadn’t heard from her best friend. ”It took me a really long time not to get the phone calls,” she said. ”I still have trouble with that.” During Lauren’s pregnancy, Frankie Hedges had thought of herself as Hailey’s other grandmother. She and Lauren had made a lot of plans. Lauren’s death meant the loss of their shared dreams for an entire extended family. ”I just feel she didn’t get what she deserved,” Hedges said. Vaclavik’s obstetric practice is ”larger” than in 2011, and he continues to have admitting privileges at Monmouth and two other hospitals, he said in his deposition. ”I will never forget” Lauren’s death, he said. ”. .. I probably suffer some post traumatic stress from this.” Hailey is 5 years old, with Lauren’s brown hair and clear green eyes. She feels her mother’s presence everywhere, thanks to Larry and his new wife Carolyn, whom he married in 2014. They met when she was a surgical tech at one of the hospitals he worked at after Lauren died. Photos and drawings of Lauren occupy the mantle of their home in Holmdel, the bookcase in the dining room, and the walls of the upstairs hallway. Larry and Carolyn and their other family members talk about Lauren freely, and even Larry’s younger daughter,    Aria, calls her ”Mommy Lauren.” On birthdays and holidays, Larry takes the girls to the cemetery. He designed the gravestone  —   his handprint and Lauren’s reaching away from each other, newborn Hailey’s linking them forever. Larry has done his best to keep Lauren’s extended family together  —   Ennis and Hedges and their families are included in every important celebration. Larry still has the video of Lauren and Hailey on his phone. ”By far the hardest thing for me to accept is [what happened] from Lauren’s perspective,” he said one recent evening, hitting the play button and seeing her alive once more. ”I can’t, I literally can’t accept it. The amount of pain she must have experienced in that exact moment when she finally had this little girl . .. I can accept the amount of pain I have been dealt,” he went on, watching Lauren stroke Hailey’s cheek. ”But [her pain] is the one thing I just can’t accept. I can’t understand, I can’t fathom it.”  NPR’s Bo Erickson, and ProPublica’s research editor Derek Kravitz and engagement reporter Adriana Gallardo contributed to this report."
"Wendy Robinson wants to make one thing very clear. As the   superintendent of Fort Wayne public schools, Indiana’s largest district, she is not afraid of competition from private schools. ”We’ve been talking choice in this community and in this school system for almost 40 years,” Robinson says. Her downtown office sits in the shadow of the city’s grand, Civil   Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. In Fort Wayne, a parking lot is the only thing that separates the beating heart of Catholic life from the brains of the city’s public schools. In fact, steeples dominate the skyline of the   City of Churches. Fort Wayne has long been a vibrant religious hub, home to more than 350 churches, many of which also run their own schools. While the city’s public and private schools managed, for decades, to   amicably, that changed in 2011, Robinson says. That’s when state lawmakers began the Indiana Choice Scholarship Program, a plan to allow   students to use vouchers, paid for with public school dollars, to attend private, generally religious schools. Six years later, Indiana’s statewide voucher program is now the largest of its kind in the country and, with President Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos openly encouraging states to embrace private school choice, the story of the Choice Scholarship  —   how it came to be, how it works and whom it serves  —   has become a national story of freedom, faith, poverty and politics. Our story begins in Fort Wayne, where the state now spends $20 million a year on voucher students, more than in any other district. This year, $1. 1 million of that $20 million went to one private,   school: St. Jude Catholic School. The story of St. Jude, St. Jude opened its school doors in March of 1929. By 2011, when the state unveiled its voucher program, the school enrolled 479 students. That first year, a small number received vouchers: just 28. Then something happened to the program that began a remarkable shift, not only at St. Jude but across the state. Father Jake Runyon saw it happening and told his parishioners. ”We’ve been seeing some financial troubles here at St. Jude Parish,” Runyon said in a formal presentation that was recorded in 2014 and posted on the church’s website. The parish was in its third straight year of financial losses. One big reason for the losses: The church was pouring money from its offertory into the school and neglecting repairs to its steeple and cooling system. Then, Runyon shared the good news: After an attempt by the state teachers union to kill the young voucher program, Indiana’s Supreme Court had found it constitutional, allowing families to spend public school dollars in private, religious schools. Not long after, the program was expanded dramatically to include children who had never attended a public school. Suddenly, many St. Jude students qualified. All they had to do was apply. ”The effect on that this year,” Runyon told parishioners in 2014, ”it would have been $118, 000 of money we just left there, that the state of Indiana wanted to give me, and we weren’t able to take advantage of it.” Runyon’s presentation  —   since taken down from the church’s website  —   was a pitch for a new way of distributing financial aid to St. Jude students, one that would maximize the money coming in through vouchers and allow the parish to use more of its offertory elsewhere. When word of the plan reached beyond St. Jude, though, it appeared to confirm the greatest fears of public school advocates: that vouchers were a giveaway to the state’s   religious schools at the expense of struggling public schools. This year, according to state data, nearly   of St. Jude’s students now receive public dollars to help pay for their private school tuition. Runyon, who is still Pastor at St. Jude, declined repeated interview requests. In the beginning, ”Social justice has come to Indiana education,” Gov. Mitch Daniels said in 2011 after the state made several big changes to its education system. Among those changes was the new voucher program, capped at 7, 500 children, to allow   students to use state education dollars to attend private schools. ”The ability to choose a school that a parent believes is best for their child’s future is no longer limited to the wealthy.” Of the children in that first voucher class,   most had two things in common: They were   and had attended public school. ”Public schools will get first shot at every child,” Daniels said back then in a speech to the   American Enterprise Institute. ”If the public school delivers and succeeds, no one will seek to exercise this choice.” Daniels, who is now the president of Purdue University, predicted that the voucher program was ”not likely to be a very large phenomenon in Indiana.” He was wrong. In 2013, Mike Pence succeeded Daniels as Indiana’s governor, and, within months, the   president oversaw a dramatic expansion of the program. Lawmakers added new pathways for students to qualify, making the voucher more accessible to children who had never attended a public school. They also expanded the program’s reach to include some   families. Voucher enrollment doubled in one year. ”It’s actually grown almost exponentially as you look at the numbers,” says the law’s proud architect, state Rep. Robert Behning, a Republican. It’s also popular, according to a 2016 survey conducted by EdChoice, a group that advocates for vouchers and other forms of school choice. Today, more than 34, 000 students are enrolled in Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program  —   3 percent of students statewide. To qualify, parents have to meet certain income limits. For a full voucher, worth 90 percent of what a state would spend in a public school, a family of four can earn no more than $45, 000 annually, but students whose parents earn up to $67, 000 can still qualify for a  . And for children already in the program, their family income can rise to nearly $90, 000 annually. The biggest headline from the program’s growth is this: Today, more than half of all voucher students in the state have no record of attending a public school. Exhibit A: Fort Wayne. ”We’re not losing kids from our schools [to vouchers],” says Superintendent Wendy Robinson. ”We’re now just having the state pay for kids who were never going to come here anyway.” In fact, Father Jake Runyon alluded to this in his 2014 presentation: ”The vast majority of the people who qualify for the Choice Scholarships were already here,” he assured his Fort Wayne parishioners after the voucher program expanded. ”So it’s not necessarily the case that we’re getting tons of new students. But it’s that a lot of the students are here.” Fort Wayne is a microcosm of what’s happening statewide, with tens of millions of state taxpayer dollars paying for children to attend private schools without, as  . Daniels had suggested, giving public schools ”first shot.” Behning, the law’s tireless defender, argues that all parents deserve to choose their child’s school, even those who have traditionally opted out of the public system. ”The intent of the program was to give parents choice,” says Behning. The parents of children in private schools, he says, ”are taxpayers just like the parents in a traditional public school.” This shift in the program’s rules, begun by Pence in 2013, has led to a shift in student demographics as well. White voucher students are up from 46 percent that first year to 60 percent today, and the share of black students has dropped from 24 percent to 12 percent. Recipients are also increasingly suburban and middle class. A third of students do not qualify for free or   meals. While the program was once premised on giving   public school families access to better schools, this year fewer than 1 percent of voucher students used a pathway, written into the law, that’s meant specifically for students leaving failing schools. ”When you look at that trend data, it is alarming,” says Jennifer McCormick, the state’s new Republican superintendent of public instruction, and a former public school teacher. She says of the old narrative that vouchers were largely meant to help   students escape underperforming public schools: ”That’s not necessarily the case” today. Social justice, Kayla   fits the old narrative. And she believes that the voucher she has been using for three years has provided a bridge to new possibilities. Kayla lives with her mother, Pauline Massy, in an apartment on the outskirts of Indianapolis. She attended public elementary and middle schools and wanted to stay in the system for high school, where she could join her neighborhood friends in show choir and color guard. They live near a public high school, but it received a C rating from the state and serves more than 2, 300 students. That was a problem for Kayla’s mother. ”Me being from the Caribbean, I really have a hard time with big,” Pauline says, sitting next to her daughter on their couch. She leans into the last word. ”You know, everything big.” Pauline, who now works in nursing, attended a crowded public high school herself in Brooklyn, and she worried that Kayla, despite being a good student, would get lost in the crowd. So she attended an open house at a small, Catholic school nearly an hour away. For a decade, Providence Cristo Rey has been housed in an old, public elementary school building near downtown Indianapolis. The wood floors creak, and the old water fountains hang at a  ’s height. It’s part of the national Cristo Rey Network, a chain of 32 private, Catholic high schools that serve   minority students. In the case of Providence Cristo Rey,   of those students are not Catholic. Pauline was impressed by the school’s intimacy it’s   the size of Kayla’s   public high school. It also has a better rating from the state, a B. She loved its emphasis on service and college completion and the fact that the school forges partnerships with local businesses and nonprofits to give students   work experience. Annual tuition in excess of $13, 000 made the school seem out of reach, but, with a state voucher and much of the rest of the cost covered by the school’s unique   program, Pauline was told she could enroll Kayla for just $20 a month. She was convinced. Kayla was not. She fought her mother over the move, calling other family members and begging them to change Pauline’s mind. It didn’t work. Because the school is an   bus ride away, Kayla needs to wake up early each morning. And that, she says, requires seven alarms: 5:30, 5:40, 5:45, 5:50, 5:55, 6. ”And then 6:10 is my mom’s phone call,” she says through braces and a broad, infectious smile. Pauline calls from the other bedroom, just across the hall. ”We don’t even talk,” Kayla says. ”I see her picture pop up on my phone, and I’m like, ’Man, it’s 6:10 already?’ But I do wake up.” By 6:30, the    is at the bus stop, ready for the long ride to a school her mother could not afford without the state’s voucher. ”You could have dreamed of this opportunity but just never have it,” Pauline says. After three years of this, Kayla says she’s happy and grateful for the move to private school. As proof, she points out that she is now a student ambassador for Providence Cristo Rey and knows just what to say to prospective students who seem as wary as she once was. ”I didn’t think I would like a small school, but I like how everyone knows everybody,” says Kayla, now a junior. ”You’re more open. You’re more able to relate to somebody and have a    connection with them than if you went to a bigger school.” Kayla is studying business and ultimately hopes to start her own hair salon. If either mother or daughter has regrets now, it’s Pauline. She says she was a passionate booster of Kayla’s public schools and hated to withdraw her. ”I believe in the public school system,” says Pauline. ”But now I have to worry about my child. And that might be selfish. It feels selfish on some days when I think about it. But I have to do what will get her to where she needs to be.” The money question, It should come as no surprise that vouchers have become a cornerstone of Providence Cristo Rey’s finances. Unlike many   private schools, it focuses on   minority students with college ambitions. Nearly every student there receives a voucher. As a result, 31 percent of the school’s total receipts last year came from vouchers, according to its annual report. This year it received $1. 4 million from the Choice Scholarship program. But vouchers have also had an important effect on more traditional private schools  —   and more affluent ones. Roncalli High School, on the opposite side of Indianapolis, is named for Pope John XXIII (born Angelo Roncalli) and receives close to $1 million a year from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Its manicured campus includes a fine arts building and a gleaming stadium for its football team, the Rebels. Roncalli, which received an A rating from the state, currently enrolls roughly 1, 200 students. One in five qualifies for free or   meals. ”The overwhelming majority [of students] are middle class, suburban  —   I call ’em good, suburban rats,” says Chuck Weisenbach, who has been Roncalli’s principal for 22 years. He repeats the line with a smile, making clear he means it affectionately. ”You know, they’re just middle class, suburban rats.” Weisenbach says he fully supports the voucher program. Echoing Daniels, he believes giving   families access to   schools like his is ”one of the greatest social justice issues our country’s facing  —   because we know education is also proven to be the most consistent avenue out of poverty.” While nearly every student at Providence Cristo Rey receives a voucher, a far smaller share of Roncalli students qualify: 30 percent. Still, given the larger size of Roncalli’s student body, that adds up to about $1. 5 million this year. And that money has allowed the school to scale back the financial aid it offers. According to the school’s vice president of finance, Dave Gervasio, the year before vouchers came along, Roncalli provided students with roughly $870, 000 in financial assistance. For next year, it’s budgeted to provide $420, 000. As a result of that $450, 000 savings, Gervasio says, they’ve been able to put more money into teacher salaries, classroom technology and a special emergency fund in case the voucher program ends someday. Today, roughly 40 percent of all private school students in Indiana receive a state voucher. The program has allowed many financially stable schools, like Roncalli, to save and invest elsewhere. For schools that were financially strapped  —   and, with Catholic school enrollment plunging in recent years, there are many of those  —   vouchers have been a lifeline, not just in Indiana but also in Milwaukee, home to the nation’s oldest voucher program. In a recent study of Milwaukee’s program, researchers found ”vouchers are now a dominant source of funding for many churches” and that parishes ”running   schools get more revenue from vouchers than from worshipers.” Also, it’s important to consider not just where the money is going in Indiana’s voucher program but where it’s coming from: a state education budget that, because of its unusual dependence on sales tax, has never fully recovered from the Great Recession. According to Indiana University’s Center for Evaluation and Education Policy, Indiana spends less per pupil, after adjusting for inflation, than it did in 2009. Meanwhile, it’s spending $146 million on private school vouchers this school year  —   compared to a projected $6. 8 billion in its public schools. Rep. Behning points out that the state spends less on a voucher student than it would if that student were in a public school. What’s left, he says, particularly the money a district raises locally through property taxes, ”stays in the public school system.” But, in Indiana, most of a school’s    classroom funding comes from the state. Local money is generally limited to covering things like building maintenance, debt and transportation. Those are not incidental costs, but when a public school loses a student to the voucher program, it loses thousands of dollars that help pay for teachers and classroom costs. The state has also created so much new demand for limited resources that, last summer, its Department of Education, then under Democratic control, released a report that Republican lawmakers dispute. It suggested that in subsidizing so many students who had never attended public school, the voucher program had actually created a $53 million deficit. In the early years of the program ”there was a small savings” to the state, says Molly Stewart, a researcher at CEEP. ”But the last two or three years, since they expanded the pathways, it’s been in the negative $50 million range  —   more state money going to education costs.” The state requires little financial transparency from private schools that benefit from vouchers, and, in rare cases, the lack of oversight has allowed them to mismanage state funds. In   a small, private Indianapolis school was approved to continue receiving voucher payments despite an investigation by the state attorney general’s office and multiple lawsuits alleging it had not paid teachers and defaulted on loans. And in 2014, 80 Catholic schools returned $3. 9 million to the state after a financial review by the Indiana dioceses found errors in calculating the cost of voucher scholarships. They cited ”misinterpreted complex guidelines” for the errors that were not uncovered by the state. Lawmakers also scuttled a recent effort to require   private schools to submit annual financial reports, in part because of Behning’s opposition. ”I look at voucher schools, when it comes to financial issues, in a very similar way that I think the state should look at any vendor we do business with,” Behning told the IndyStar. ”If we receive services, we should give them a payment. How they handle that payment, as long as they’re not doing something illegal, is not in the state’s jurisdiction.” Robert Enlow believes there’s a double standard at the bottom of this transparency debate. ”I will argue that   schools are far more transparent [than public schools],” says Enlow, the president and CEO of EdChoice, a school choice advocacy group. He calls the Choice Scholarship program ”rigorously accountable” and complains that ”just getting a   statement from a traditional public school district is impossible.” Enlow also points out that, when it comes to academic accountability, Indiana stands out among voucher states. Its   private schools are accredited and required to administer the state test. They must also submit to the state’s   system, which grades schools based on various benchmarks, including test scores and graduation rates. Private schools can even be prevented from accepting new voucher students if they receive a D or F rating for two consecutive years, though lawmakers recently agreed to let these struggling schools apply for a waiver that would allow them to continue. Turning kids away, Unlike voucher programs in some other states, participating private schools in Indiana have the freedom to do what they’ve always done: admit or reject students based on their own guidelines, even if those students are using   vouchers. Behning defends that decision, saying it was important that schools retain their ability to be selective. ”The one reason we let schools have some admissions criteria is we did not want to change the very fiber of those schools.” What qualifies as fiber? A spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Education, Adam Baker, says ”a private school can deny a student based on past academic performance or prior disciplinary action,” among other criteria. Some schools post GPA requirements on their websites. Struggling students need not apply. Ditto students with a suspension. This has raised fears among the state’s public school leaders that private schools are  . ”Anecdotally, yes, we hear that schools can ” Baker says, but he insists that the state has ”never received a formal complaint from a parent.” Behning’s ”fiber” isn’t limited to academic performance or behavior. Some private schools also require parents to certify that they are members of the church that manages the school or to sign a statement of faith. In its online admissions packet, Lighthouse Christian Academy in Bloomington lays out its expectations of students. It lists ”behaviors prohibited in the Bible” to include ”homosexual or bisexual activity or any form of sexual immorality” and ”practicing alternate gender identity or any other identity or behavior that violates God’s ordained distinctions between the two sexes, male and female.” The school then makes clear that, ”in situations in which the home life violates these standards, LCA reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student.” Lighthouse received $665, 400 in state voucher dollars this year. The 2011 voucher law prohibited the state from regulating ”curriculum content, religious instruction or activities, classroom teaching, teacher and staff hiring requirements, and other activities carried out by the eligible school.” When it comes to selectivity, private schools in Indiana enjoy considerable freedom  —   so much, in fact, that it might be more instructive to ask: For what reasons can they not deny a student admission? Baker, the Department of Education spokesman, says private schools ”cannot deny children based on race, color, national origin or disability” in accordance with state civil rights law. Yet there is evidence that these protections are limited and open to interpretation. ”They do not have the resources to support the child” Just outside the Indianapolis city limits, Carol Crawn sits at her breakfast table scrolling through Facebook. Behind her, in the living room, the Today show plays quietly on a television over the fireplace. Her    daughter, who is on the autism spectrum, sleeps quietly on the sofa, her hair an explosion of ringlets. Crawn is a special education teacher by training and an advocate for people just like her  —   parents of children with disabilities who are trying to navigate a state education system that doesn’t always have their child’s interests in mind. Case in point: Crawn points out a recent Facebook thread among a community of Indianapolis parents. It begins: ”How do school vouchers work?” ”I’m not clear on the details,” says one commenter, ”but I do know that private schools do not have to provide accommodations for students with special needs.” This, says Crawn, is a common concern among parents of students with disabilities. They’re not sure why the system isn’t working for their children, but they’re sure it isn’t working. A   advocate with Family Voices Indiana, Crawn tries to connect these parents with resources. When she first noticed the Facebook thread, she posted, in part: ”What happens in private schools frequently [is that they] will not accept a child with a disability into their school because they do not have the resources to support the child.” Crawn knows firsthand, even though her family does not qualify for a voucher. ”I had asked for an   meeting to discuss options, and they refused,” Crawn says of one private school where she had tried to enroll her daughter. The school rebuffed her after seeing her daughter’s Individualized Education Program, or IEP, a public school document that outlines a student’s special needs. ”They said, ’Send us her IEP via email,’” Crawn remembers. ”And then they said, ’No, we’re not equipped to handle her. ’” Some schools, like Roncalli High, the Catholic school in Indianapolis, do have the resources and are more inclusive. Among its offerings for   students is what Principal Chuck Weisenbach calls its Life Academy. The program includes academics, work study and time spent in a mock apartment where students cook for themselves, budget and do their own laundry. But it’s a very different story at Kayla  ’ private school, Providence Cristo Rey. ”Public schools can work with a special ed. kid and provide wraparound services because they receive [extra] dollars from the state,” says Emil Ekiyor, a school spokesman. ”Well, we don’t receive that so, if we take that student, we’d be doing an injustice to that family because we just can’t provide all the services they need.” According to state data, Providence Cristo Rey did not enroll a single student this year who requires special education services. Liberty Christian School’s two campuses, in Anderson, received more than $1. 5 million this year in state vouchers but include this caveat in their admissions policy: ”Liberty Christian School may not possess the resources to provide for students who have . .. a physical handicap, which would impair the learning process under normal educational conditions” or ”a learning disability for which our program is not staffed.” This year, 8 percent of Liberty Christian’s 521   students receive special education services. That’s higher than many   private schools but well below the state average, 14. 5 percent. This is key to understanding Indiana’s voucher program. Public schools are required to accept all students, regardless of disability. Voucher schools are not. In many cases, it’s not the students who choose the schools but the schools that choose the students. ”That is discrimination,” says Robinson, the Fort Wayne superintendent. What does the law say? Most students are protected from school discrimination by the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. But private, religious schools are exempt from the ADA, and most voucher schools in Indiana are religious. Voucher schools argue that they’re not discriminating they’re simply being honest. And the state appears to agree with them. The Indiana Department of Education says it encourages these schools to be upfront with families about their limitations. If they don’t believe they can serve a student with special needs, they should say that. The parent doesn’t have to choose that school. When NPR pointed out that some private schools are, indeed, discouraging and even turning away special education students, the department said it has never received a formal parent complaint of discrimination. Baker, the Department of Education spokesman, wants to be clear, though: The state’s new, Republican superintendent, Jennifer McCormick, would like to see change. Her administration believes any school ”that receives public dollars should be held to the same standard. We’ve made that known,” Baker says. ”Unfortunately, that’s not in our hands to make that change. That’s a legislative decision.” In other words, lawmakers created the program. Only they can change it. In the meantime, Robinson, the Fort Wayne superintendent, says state data prove that special education students are being turned away: ”Just look at the records. The gen. ed student is in a private, parochial school. The special ed student’s [in public school].” NPR did look at the records. Here’s what we found: In Fort Wayne, Robinson is right: Students who receive special education services are much more likely to attend public schools, where federal law guarantees they will get a free, appropriate education. More than 15 percent of the city’s public school students are considered special education. But the average special education rate at private schools now being used by Fort Wayne voucher students is less than half that, 6. 5 percent. And Fort Wayne is the rule, not the exception. Seventeen percent of public school students in Indianapolis receive special education. In private, voucher schools used by Indianapolis students, the rate is 7 percent. It’s the same story in Evansville (16 percent in public schools vs. 7. 5 percent in voucher schools) and Gary (14. 5 percent vs. 3. 5 percent) and, in fact, most other school districts across the state. It’s easy to forget that these data are built of human stories, like Ashley’s. She’s a mother in the Indianapolis area who used vouchers to enroll her two daughters in a local, private school affiliated with their church. ”Without the voucher,” Ashley says sitting at her kitchen table, ”we wouldn’t have been able to do that. And we’re really grateful that we had that choice.” Her    son, Isaac, who is on the autism spectrum, giggles in the other room. He loves being tickled by a visiting therapist who specializes in what’s known as applied behavior analysis. Out of concern for her children’s privacy  —   and because Ashley wants to maintain a cordial relationship with her church and daughters’ school  —   we are using her first name only. Ashley hoped that Isaac could attend private school alongside his sisters, and she reached out to the principal of her daughters’ school. ”But [the principal] didn’t feel that she could offer Isaac what he needed, and so that was kind of, uh, where that stopped,” she says, clearly hurt but also not wanting to hurt the school her daughters love. ”I think every   parent goes through periods of grieving, sometimes when your expectations don’t meet reality. Or you don’t have the opportunities that you had hoped to have for your child. And I think, in my mind, I had a very optimistic view of him being alongside his sisters.” ”I don’t think there’s any question that private school choice programs are not set up to take students with disabilities,” says Julie Wright Halbert, legislative counsel for the Council of the Great City Schools. ”And I think it’s extremely concerning.” This phenomenon even came up earlier this year, in a heated Senate hearing: ”Many of us see this as the potential for turning our public schools into warehouses for the most challenging kids with disabilities or other kinds of particular issues,” said Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, whose son has cerebral palsy. Enlow, of EdChoice, argues that the way Indiana funds its voucher program, giving private schools less money per student than it gives to public schools, makes it difficult for voucher schools to serve   students. ”If we’re really talking about equity here,” Enlow says, ”we’re actually saying that you should fund a kid based on what they need, not worry about what school it is.” He also questions the expectation that every school be able to serve every child. ”One size fits all doesn’t actually fit anyone,” Enlow says. ”We need to have a fairly honest conversation about how do we serve all kids at the school that serves them best  —   not, how does every single school serve all kids.” Choice desert, To understand school choice in Indiana, it’s also important to look where choice isn’t available. In central Indiana sits the small, rural town of Eminence. It’s home to a gas station and convenience store where farmers gather each morning for coffee and conversation, a post office, bank and Indiana’s   school district. Here, life revolves around the district’s only school. ”Everything starts at the school,” says Sarah Finney, Eminence Community Schools’ PTO president. ”We have community events there. People who can’t afford to have funerals, have funerals there.” Memorials to former students ornament the school’s walls. A cabinet packed with basketball trophies sits across from class photos dating back to 1901. Finney always planned for her sons, ages 5 and 8, to attend the   district with about 375 students, from   through 12th grade. Her husband’s family has for generations. ”Our kids know everybody,” Finney says. ”The parents know everybody.” While much of the state focuses on private school choice, this tiny district fights its own battles. Chief among them? Enrollment. About 1 in 6 students has left in the past five years. When an Eminence student leaves, so does roughly $6, 870 in state funding. Officials say a recent property tax hike, grants and a new     program have kept them from going in the red. Yet dropping enrollment can’t be chalked up to private school choice, like elsewhere in the state. There are no private schools nearby. ”I’ve never come across one family looking for a voucher for private,” says Corey Scott, Eminence principal. ”Most of them are in this community just trying to stay afloat.” It’s a common sentiment across rural Indiana. Small populations mean few private schools  —   and little incentive for new ones to open. The closest private schools that accept vouchers are a   drive from Eminence. Pushes from state and national politicians for private school choice aren’t relevant to the area, Scott says. ”To be completely honest, I just ignore everything they say and do,” she says. ”They’re going to make decisions regardless of anything that we have to say.” Indiana lets students hop borders to attend other public schools. That has created some problems for Eminence, a   district, though students aren’t leaving because of academics. According to several school officials, the main reason parents cite for leaving is sports. Eminence is too small to field a football team. Still, Scott worries that decisions made on the national stage could trickle down to her district. As the Trump administration’s education priority centers on school choice, she has one question: ”What do you do with the rest of us?” What the research says, While it’s clear that many children have been left out of Indiana’s voucher program  —   because of geography, grades or special needs  —   34, 000 students are now enrolled. For them, it’s important to ask: Are they better off academically? Researchers Mark Berends of Notre Dame and R. Joseph Waddington of the University of Kentucky have spent years studying Indiana’s voucher program and its impact. While they’ve not yet released their statewide results, they have published a narrower view  —   of Indianapolis kids in grades  . The numbers aren’t promising. Students in Indianapolis who left public schools to attend private Catholic schools, for example, experienced no benefit in reading but ”moderate and statistically significant average annual losses in mathematics compared with the gains they experienced while attending traditional public schools,” the report says. Berends adds that’s ”roughly like students moving from the 50th percentile down to about the 44th percentile” in math. And, he says, that’s the effect over the course of one year. ”So, if this continues over multiple years,” Berends warns, ”you can see that that’s a pretty dramatic drop in achievement. By analyzing additional years, we’ll be able to see if further losses occur or not.” While it’s not yet clear whether students performed similarly statewide, Berends says his Indianapolis results are consistent with studies of voucher programs in Louisiana and Ohio. A new review of the only federally funded voucher program in the country, in Washington, D. C. also found academic declines among students who used a voucher to attend a private school. In 2015, Dennis Epple, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, helped lead a bird’s eye survey of voucher research. Of the ”tightest” studies he reviewed, ”the evidence from those studies with respect to achievement is something of a disappointment for people who are strong proponents of vouchers,” Epple says. ”Overall, the achievement effects . .. were limited. There is some evidence that   students benefit from vouchers, but that evidence is quite limited and not robust.” As a result, Epple and his fellow researchers wrote that, while vouchers appeared to improve outcomes for some students in some settings, ”the empirical research on small scale programs does not suggest that awarding students a voucher is a systematically reliable way to improve educational outcomes.” A 2017 review from the   Economic Policy Institute came to a similar conclusion. Martin Carnoy of Stanford University writes, ”extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.” One small, potential benefit from vouchers has shown up in multiple studies: a bump in public schools’ performance as they compete with private schools. ”That is one of the more robust effects,” says Epple. ”Competition improves the performance of the public schools that are most closely threatened, for want of a better word, by the voucher program.” Epple points to public school improvement in Florida and Milwaukee. Researchers found similar evidence of a bump in Ohio. Ironically, this suggests that one of the most consistent benefits of vouchers is enjoyed by students who choose not to use them. What’s next? ”I think Indiana is in an interesting situation right now,” says Jennifer McCormick, the state superintendent. ”Because we have six years that we’ve had the program. Our charge right now is, what is that next step?” Her answer: Review the program and whether it’s a wise use of taxpayer dollars. ”You know, we’re spending roughly $146 million on a program and not really reviewing it,” McCormick says. ”That is irresponsible.” Superintendent Wendy Robinson, in Fort Wayne, doesn’t need a review. She is emphatic that vouchers are ”an assault on public education.” The program’s architect, Rep. Behning, pleads patience. Six years, he argues, is still not enough time to judge the state’s school choice experiment. What’s more, student performance is just one measure of vouchers’ success or failure, Behning says. ”Parents choose for a variety of reasons. It’s not always academics . .. I think the best judgment is parental choice.” In other words, for the program’s defenders, choice isn’t just the vehicle, it’s the destination. An EdChoice survey of voucher parents, conducted last summer, is instructive. Among the   reasons parents cited for enrolling their child in a private school, ”better academics” ranked second, not first. At the top of the list was ”religious  .” ”It is not the government’s responsibility to tell me where to educate my children,” says Weisenbach, principal of the private Roncalli High in Indianapolis. ”That’s not only my right, it’s my duty. And I shouldn’t have the government telling me based on some random, geographic location that I have to go to this public high school.” And Behning argues that the program can be judged a failure  —   or unnecessary  —   when parents stop choosing to use vouchers to leave the state’s public schools. The problem with that standard is that more than half of this year’s voucher class didn’t leave a public school  —   because they’ve never attended one. What Gov. Mitch Daniels said in 2011, that ”public schools will get first shot at every child,” is simply not true anymore. And this gets to the question at the heart of the debate over school choice in Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Eminence and nationwide. What is the purpose? If it’s to give parents more options, then Indiana can check that box. After all, 34, 000 students are now using the voucher program. If the purpose is to help   children find schools where they’re more likely to learn, grow and succeed, that’s happening for some of those 34, 000, to be sure. Just ask Kayla  . But research suggests that vouchers may also be doing more harm than good for many students  —   and are not opening doors for children with expensive special needs or low grades or who don’t have parents like Pauline Massy to make sure they catch the bus every morning and finish their homework every night. As the nation looks to Indiana as one model for private school choice, one thing is clear: Choice is in the eye of the beholder. Peter   covers education for Indiana Public Broadcasting.

"Is music an escape from the world or the key to it? Over and over, when we began considering the best music of the first half of 2017, politics seemed to intrude, whether in moments that echoed headlines or ones that spoke individual truths too often drowned out by that other, noisier machine. Maybe that’s the case every time the calendar turns over. Probably not.  Rather than attempt to come to a consensus about the best albums or songs from the first six months of the year, we opted to select music that was meaningful to us as individuals, music that washed away all the background noise, songs and albums and performances that made sense to us, whether or not they made sense of the world. Moments like that are blessings, not to be taken for granted. Here are nearly four dozen blessings selected by NPR Music staff and our partners from around the public radio system. Let’s count them.  Like many people I know, this year’s deluge of real world news has conjured an   anxiety simmering just below the skin. So when I need a musical reprieve and a      few artists are as satisfying as Charly Bliss. A debut with sunny melodies and blistering guitar riffs that would make Weezer proud, Guppy is a taut,   thrill ride. But there’s more to its charm than meets the eye: Embedded in Spencer Fox’s powerful hooks and Eva Hendricks’ bubbly voice is a wounded vulnerability and blunt honesty that imbues these songs with heartfelt meaning. That’s especially true of the throttling   anthem ”Glitter,” in which Hendricks unfurls     that take aim at anyone who’s mistreated her while owning up to her   behavior. ”Am I the best? Or just the first person to say yes?” she sings  —   one of the year’s best      —   with equal parts   adolescent wonder, introspective regret and   sneer. It’s this sweet and sour combo that makes Guppy one of those immediately   albums that’s guaranteed to enliven even your most   days.  —  Mike Katzif, Wayne Shorter, the illustrious saxophonist and composer, has led his current quartet for the better part of two decades. I’ve seen the group  —   a magically cohesive unit with Danilo Pérez on piano, John Patitucci on bass and Brian Blade on drums  —   eight or nine times over the years, and I’ve never witnessed a more transcendent or turbocharged performance than this one. Circumstances may have played a role in that remarkable outcome. Shorter had returned at long last to Newark, his old stomping grounds, for a   festival in his honor via NJPAC’s TD Jazz Series the quartet played the second half of a concert that began with Shorter in improvised duologue with the keyboardist Herbie Hancock. There was also the thrill of a new challenge: Shorter had composed a dynamic, suitelike piece, ”Scout,” which the band was performing in public for the first time. But the most important factor was simply the   insatiably curious instinct of the man himself, who at 83 is not only an undiminished force on his horn but seemingly still intent on pushing against every conceivable boundary.  —  Nate Chinen, WBGO, The mythical figure of the rock star was sacrificed on the altar of Generation X’s pessimism long ago. It’s been 26 years since Kurt Cobain ignited the pyre with Nevermind, nearly fifteen since Elliott Smith’s death choked its last ash. Yet this year, another Pacific Northwesterner threw a match. No Shape, the fourth album by Mike Hadreas as Perfume Genius, explodes the   confines of his previous work, reasserting the power of audacious desire and transformative expressiveness. It’s a personal triumph and a challenge to both the misogyny and homophobia that rock performance has often masked, as well as the sexually neutered solution that reformists like Nirvana offered. Hadreas walks through the flame and emerges incombustible, the Khaleesi the rock world needs, and he’s been proving it on tour all year. In May, at Nashville’s   Hadreas wore a corseted gown with Bowie pinstripes and a Castro clone’s muscle tank. As the   band built a roar, he contorted his limbs in rhythm with the music’s crackle. The set peaked again and again. Then, at the encore, Hadreas sat alone at his keyboard to sing ”Alan,” his love song to longtime companion and collaborator Alan Wyffels. ”Though I’d hide, maybe leave something secret behind,” he murmured, dwelling on the diminished expectations of his   star past. But then he put his doubts to rest, and let his falsetto loose to fill the room. ”I’m here, how weird!” he sang. The affirmation went out to both Wyffels and the rapt audience before him. Wyffels emerged and sat next to Hadreas to play an older song, ”Learning” the two men chased each other’s fingers on the keyboard, Hadreas bottoming Wyffels’s arpeggiated runs. It was a perfect moment: an expression of love and security that could take the men offering it to each other somewhere new every night. It was freedom, lighting a way forward in the dark.  —  Ann Powers, My favorite musical experience this year hasn’t necessarily been a favorite song or album. Instead, it’s a ”moment” from the 2017 Folk Alliance International Conference, held in Kansas City in February. The FAI organization brings together folk and roots musicians from around the world for the annual conference, and this year’s theme was ”Forbidden Folk: Celebrating Activism In Art.” M. C. Hansen, from the Danish band The Sentimentals, invited a number of artists who were in town for the conference over to the house where we were staying to record Woody Guthrie’s ”This Land Is Your Land.” It was very impromptu, but Hansen rounded up about 22 artists representing various countries to sing verses of the folk anthem in four different languages. It felt very powerful and positive, and like something we all really needed to hear at the time.  —  Linda Fahey, Folk Alley, It’s weird to say this, but the definitive version of The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band came out in 2017, not 1967. I’m saying this as someone who rarely listens to box set   as someone who values original intent. And oddly, that’s exactly why I love the newly mixed stereo version of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.  In 1967, when George Martin and The Beatles mixed Sgt. Pepper’s, they were caught in a mono world that, unbeknownst to them, was about to become obsolete. And so they spent weeks mixing the mono version, while the stereo mix was almost an afterthought  —   yet the latter is the version the world listens to. I’m one of those geeks that has amassed multiple versions of the mono Sgt. Pepper’s from various pressings around the globe. It’s brilliant. And despite my love for those recordings, hearing Giles Martin’s 21st century mixes based on his father’s careful notes, using original recorded tracks before they had to be bounced to accommodate the   tape machines of the day, I feel that much closer to the four creative souls who made the most important record in my life. The world isn’t going back to mono. And now, having heard these new mixes, I’m never going back to the old stereo version.  —  Bob Boilen, What makes this work so prodigious? Is it the   production? Lamar’s lyricism? (Is it wickedness? Is it weakness? You decide.) Certainly, ancestry plays a role (I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA) along with narratives of social phenomena like political cynicism (I got so many theories and suspicions). One thing is certain: The album’s significance will surely be epic. (Years in the making and don’t y’all mistake it.) With ”Stormy” themes like solitude (Feel like only me and the music, though) and ambition (My resume is real enough for two millenniums) Lamar also reveals his vulnerability (I understand I ain’t perfect). Religious references abound (Nobody pray for me). There’s a touch of romance (Love me, I wanna be with you). One of my favorite lines from ”XXX.” (America, God bless you if it’s good to you) is a sharp political statement. Lamar’s raps about fear (The shock value of my success put bolts in me) gratitude (Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous) and good   storytelling (they say   came circlin’ parking lots) put this album among 2017’s masterworks.  —  Suraya Mohamed, Sometimes, it can seem like there are no more surprises left in the world  —   no ground left unsurveyed, no sonic discoveries yet to be had. And then, along comes the band Bargou 08, with one of the most exhilarating and startling albums of the year. Frontman Nidhal Yahyaoui spent more than a decade collecting the folk music he heard growing up in Tunisia’s Bargou Valley  —   a poor, landlocked and isolated area in northern Tunisia. (The name of the album, Targ, refers to the dialect spoken in the area around Yahyaoui’s home  —   it’s a combination of Arabic and Amazigh, or Berber.) Propelled in part by the energy of the Tunisian revolution in 2011, Yahyaoui and his longtime friend and collaborator, a producer and keyboardist named Sofyan Ben Youssef, transformed those old folk songs into an electronic,   paradise. The result is an intoxicating blend of modern beats, synths, drums, the throaty   gasba flute, a hearty zokra (cousin to the oboe) the   wtar and Yahyaoui’s impassioned vocals.  —  Anastasia Tsioulcas, When I first listened to ”Mary,” I was folding my laundry on a Sunday. Capacity, the latest from Big Thief, has more than its fair share of stunning moments, but when ”Mary” came on, I was transported. The song has a way of hallowing any moment in its even tenderness  —   of ennobling even the tedious matching of socks. It’s a love song to the world and an ode of gratitude to a dear friend. It sounds like a hymn and a lullaby. ”First it sounds and then it means,” Adrianne Lenker, the song’s writer and singer, told me later in an interview. To me, it sounded like my favorite song of the year thus far.  —  Benjamin   The start of 2017 was noisy. It was often hard to hear anything with clarity above the confusing, chaotic and divisive din of news and opinions. This a capella performance by a handful of young women in a crowd of millions felt like the only sound that could cut through that noise. The story goes that L. A.’s Connie Lim, aka Milck, spent years trying to weave her wounds from domestic violence and anorexia into a song that felt true to her experience on ”Quiet”. Lim spent another year shopping around for the right label to execute its perfect release. But in the wake of the 2016 election, Lim threw all planning out the window. She found a group of singers who would be in D. C. on January 21, sent them individual vocal parts over the Internet and met them for one rehearsal before they stood together in pink pussy hats to perform ”Quiet” in cascading harmony at the Women’s March on Washington. The viral video that resulted, the fact that this song became an unofficial anthem for the March and any subsequent attention Milck has received are all   of the purest reason music is made and shared  —   because an artist has something vital to say, and literally can’t keep quiet. The sonic imprint they made on my heart, and I think on a lot of hearts around the country, still pulses well into 2017.  —  Talia Schlanger, World Cafe, I never intended to like this record. I don’t say that to assert my hipster bona fides I rocked out in earnest to ”What Makes You Beautiful” for a good semester and was immediately on board with ”PILLOWTALK” when Styles’ former bandmate Zayn Malik struck out on his own last year. But that was just the problem: Zayn was supposed to be the Timberlake to 1D’s *NSYNC, and I wasn’t ready to entertain a challenge to the throne. Luckily, Styles’ solo debut makes no pass at moody   instead laying bare his   influences. Harry Styles is full of shining moments: Styles soaring over the glorious ”Sign of the Times” coda, the clever poignancy of his best lyrics (”Even my phone misses your call”) the winking,      ’s in ”Woman.” Even the album’s rollout was delightful: At a time when surprise drops are pop’s new normal, Styles’ more traditional campaign included an amiably ridiculous turn as Mick Jagger on SNL and singing ”Landslide” with Stevie Nicks. The trope of the teen pop star hoping to reinvent as Serious Artist is well known Harry Styles strives for artistry without taking itself too seriously.  —  Rachel Horn, In an interview months after the release of Blonde, the album the world thought it would die waiting for, Frank Ocean declared himself free from traditional music strictures: ”Because I’m not in a record deal, I don’t have to operate in an album format. I can operate in    format.” Though not    ”Chanel,” which first emerged on Ocean’s Apple Music radio show in March, is his first foray into this territory of possibility. Where Blonde often meandered through hazy space, ”Chanel” is propulsive, swaggering. ”Can’t you see I am the big man? God level, I am the I am,” he  . For me, the charisma of ”Chanel” comes from the twists of Ocean’s delivery, the rise and fall and rise of his emotive voice throughout the song. When the tenderness that colors ”It’s really you on my mind” gives way to the hoarse,   urgency of a verse about cars, diamonds, cosigns and stealth  —   it’s in those precise moments when Ocean’s assertion that he ”sees both sides like Chanel” and his confident grasp of doubleness are made manifest.  —  Karen Gwee, Beth Ditto doesn’t reinvent pop  —   she reminds us why its basic formula is so effective. Her new album, Fake Sugar, shaved about a minute off my running time. I eventually gave up choosing tracks to add to my playlist and just put the whole album on repeat. If the music feels recognizable, the video for the first single, ”Fire,” reminds us why Ditto is such a radical pop star. She is an unapologetically queer, fat, southern fashionista. And it doesn’t hurt that, like so many beloved divas before her, a single note out of her mouth can blow the roof off a building.  —  Ari Shapiro, I let out a   ”Yes!” at my desk on April 10 when I heard Du Yun’s name announced as the Pulitzer winner in music for her chamber opera Angel’s Bone. The win not only rewards Du Yun’s audacious,   score, but also supports the evidence that   opera is meaningful and thriving. Moments later, I realized that the two finalists  —   Ashley Fure and Kate Soper  —   were also women. Later still, I thought perhaps the Pulitzer jury was somehow listening when composer Andrew Norman spoke to NPR Music last November about diversity in the classical music world. ”The canon is overwhelmingly white and male,” he said. ”But we can use new music to fix that.” The Pulitzer results are a step in the right direction in a musical world dominated by men  —   one where male musicians, such as conductor Yuri Temirkanov, openly declare women unfit to conduct orchestras and where a survey of 85 American orchestras in the   season showed that female composers made up only 1. 3 percent of the music performed. We’ve got a long way to go, but Du Yun’s win made me hopeful.  —  Tom Huizenga, This past year brought on a new wave of feminism, and with it, the most strikingly feminine album I have heard. At 27 years of age, U. K.   Laura Marling has crafted a collection of intimate, emotionally rich songs that seek to explore the female gaze turned on itself. Semper Femina  —   Latin for ”always woman”  —   is Marling’s conscious edit of a cautionary phrase from Virgil’s Aeneid: Varium et mutabile semper femina. (”Woman is ever a fickle and changeable thing. ”) In fact, it is precisely the mutability and complexity of women, in our relationships to each other and to the world around us, that Marling celebrates within these nine vignettes. From the darkly sensual album opener, ”Soothing,” which banishes with love an unwelcome lover, to the coda, ”Nothing Not Nearly,” which concludes ”nothing matters more than love,” she gets to the heart of the beautifully multifaceted nature of women  —   and, indeed, of Marling herself. Personally, I am deeply grateful to her for the gift of this panoramic view of ourselves: We need soothing. We can take away your pain. We need beauty. We cry sometimes. We sing. We put up a fight. We need to be free. We love you. We are the muse, but also the artist. We were wild once, and must remember. Semper Femina.  —  Carmel Holt, WFUV, The show could not be advertised, merely passed by word of mouth and personal text messages. Just four days after the Pizzagate gunman pled guilty to charges, Arrington De Dionyso returned to Comet Ping Pong, the D. C. pizza joint that had been embroiled in malicious and baseless Internet rumors in which the artist himself had also been circuitously implicated. Where his confrontational but stunning visual art once hung, De Dionyso and local improvisers (two drummers and an upright bassist) came to cleanse the space with fervid purpose. The room was nervous, but full and open. With an army of saxophones (both traditional and invented from PVC pipes) De Dionyso inhaled the ghost of Albert Ayler and spewed cathartic fire for over an hour straight, a cyclonic love cry to truth and sonic protest.  —  Lars Gotrich, One of the most important things an artist can do in a time of violent desperation and brazen inequality like the one we’re living in now is to make music that jars, disrupts and intervenes. But throughout the first half of this year, I’ve also found myself craving a salve, and finding it in the willful steadiness of Valerie June’s mystically    opus The Order of Time, her song ”If And” especially. In serene   she reminds us of the consequences of neglecting our most intimate relationships. ”One thing for sho’ one thing that’s fate   If and you don’t show them you love them, it will be too late,” she nudges in her balmy, nasal twang, her melody turning bluesy curls around a droning chord. June doesn’t just sing of trustworthiness  —   she models it vocally, adding syllables for fluidity’s sake and smoothing her phrasing of particular lines into cursive triplets. It feels equally nurturing and insistent.  —  Jewly Hight, This electronic reimagining of the sacred and the secular was like discovering a door into another dimension, a world that is familiar but sounds completely new. Band leader Otura Mun is an     from the Midwest who, through a crazy airline mix up, ended up in Puerto Rico instead of Jamaica. He found a musical and spiritual home in the sacred beats and chants of   Santería music. He and his visionary bandmates attached electronic triggers to traditional percussion instruments and fed their vocals through voice manipulators to create an amazing album that reveals something new with each listen. I have been a fan and student of   music for over 40 years and thought I heard every iteration of the music until I heard this.  —  Felix Contreras, You can’t miss him on the cover of XXL’s 2017 Freshman Issue: He’s the rapper wearing the most tortured expression. XXXTentacion has been knocked out cold during a concert, performed insane stage dives, even   one of his own fans in alleged  . His outlaw record and the hype surrounding his summer tour  —   which he recently cut short after learning his cousin had been shot  —   almost overshadows the fact that he’s behind some of the most unexpected, experimental   released this year. His hardcore Billboard charter ”Look At Me!” is the biggest song to emerge from a scene of     young rappers from South Florida who are stacking up SoundCloud plays by the millions. But as his Revenge EP, released in May, reveals, his sound is boundless, shifting effortlessly from explicit   ballad (”I don’t wanna do this anymore”) to   softcore (”Looking for a Star”) to grunge grinder (”Valentine”) back to punk confessional (”Slipknot”). And when he raps, ”Due to my history   I don’t know what’s next for me,” on the latter, it sounds less like typical   posturing than   premonition.  —  Rodney Carmichael, Sylvan Esso’s spangly   songs can throb joyfully, even ecstatically. But on What Now, even the brashest bashers  —   ”The Glow,” ”Kick Jump Twist,” et al  —   are deepened by the gently reflective ballads that surround them. As producer Nick Sanborn gives weight to the soft static in ”Slack Jaw,” for example, Amelia Meath sings of the way being in love can produce a strangely humbling sense of awe: ”I got all the parts I’ve wished for   I’ve got everything I need   Sometimes I’m above water   But mostly I’m at sea.” As its title suggests, What Now fixates heavily on aftermaths, whether it documents   pressures in the grabby ”Radio” or, in ”Die Young,” faces down a logistical complication Meath hadn’t anticipated: ”I was gonna die young   Now I gotta wait for you.” But the album feels most of all like a celebration  —   of connection, of commitment and acceptance, of movement and sound and the liberation that comes with letting love in.  —  Stephen Thompson, Phil Elverum’s latest album as Mount Eerie, A Crow Looked At Me, deals with the quiet aftermath of his wife Geneviève’s death from cancer. It’s the year’s heaviest album without question, filled with lucid observations about grief, loss and becoming a widowed parent, and all the more devastating for Elverum’s plainspoken delivery. Friends who are obsessive fans have told me that they can’t listen to it, or listened once and put it away. So when Mount Eerie was booked to play at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery this April, you can only imagine that the    songwriter was in on the incredibly bleak joke. There was an air of trepidation in the Masonic Lodge prior to the show, with fans discretely folding toilet tissue into their pockets in the bathrooms. But although it was by no means uplifting, our complicity in being willing to sit through it, and the sheer, unerring horror of Elverum’s lyrics, gave the evening an air of borderline comedic camaraderie. Elverum performed alone with an acoustic guitar. He told us we could expect 13 songs and no encore. A dead Christmas tree stood to his left. ”If you’re wondering what this is here for, it’s so you have something to look at instead of me,” he informed us. On the song ”Swims,” he sang about how, two months after Geneviève died, ”our counselor died,” which elicited choked laughter at the awful inappropriateness of it all. He paused the song: ”It’s true!” I managed to hold it together until the penultimate song, ”Crow,” Elverum’s address to his infant daughter: ”Sweet kid, what is this world we’re giving you? Smoldering and fascist with no mother.” His composure was admirable and horrifying. After the gig, I was surprised to see a line of people queuing to meet Elverum, who was cheerfully shaking hands. But it reminded me that although we use the word ”funereal” to convey unutterable darkness, it’s the people at those sad events who light up the possibility of carrying on.  —  Laura Snapes, This spring, Leslie Feist returned after a   hiatus with the best album she’s ever made. Pleasure, her fifth   is spare, raw and gritty. It’s also intensely intimate, particularly in the spacious way it was recorded, with a sound that feels like you’re sitting in her bedroom as she unspools her grief and emotional upheaval. The album lacks the infectious, carefree joy of songs like ”1234” or ”Mushaboom,” but is still built around inspired melodies and surprising turns  —   like the group chorus that suddenly kicks in halfway through ”A Man Is Not His Song,” or Jarvis Cocker’s dramatic reading toward the end of ”Century.” Every element, from Feist’s vocal performances to the brilliant production, is utterly transfixing.  —  Robin Hilton, It’s hot out. Take a moment to transport yourself to a winter wonderland: a   in the snow. This music video is shot like a scene from The Revenant, with Quavo, Offset and Takeoff decked out in bearskin, head to claw, bopping around in the taiga. It’s at once goofy and gorgeous and entrancing. And if the visuals are hypnotizing, the rapping is an incantation. Pulsating lyrics (”Neck water faucet   Mockingbirds mocking”) and surging instrumentals make you forget that there’s no real reason to be doing what they’re doing: riding snowmobiles, drinking hot chocolate, shooting wooden arrows into the sky. You want to live with them on that mountain anyway.  —  Leah Donnella, ”Timing’s off, and everything’s lost, and I know it. Elixirs wear off and each dose, the cost of a memory,” Taylor Kirk sings at the opening of ”Moment,” a sad, hopeful song with the contours of a wilted flytrap. I really did try to find, to celebrate the   mark, something more upbeat than Timber Timbre’s dour, restrained, frustrated, lush lament of love that’s seen as deeply undeserved, inevitably lost and retroactively repurposed as a spiritual divining rod. Maybe, considering that I’d found a nice, sustainable bit of my own love recently, the fear of its loss and the odd guilt conjoined to its simple existence resonated more deeply into my tectonics than sad songs usually do (and they always do). ”The privilege of you . .. desire deserving of something more true.” Does everyone, once they have it, fear they have not have earned it? Or is that just for us imposters? Are we all entitled to it? Is the gravity and degree of that love meant to be symbolic of the person who holds it, a totem to their worth? Considering all this . .. maybe I’ll just keep my head down and try to stay out of trouble.  —  Andrew Flanagan, Kelli Schaefer is a local musician, so some of opbmusic’s staff had already seen her unveil songs from her album No Identity during a gig several months prior to this session. We thought we knew what to expect  —   but we weren’t prepared for this. Schaefer, who’s known as a talented guitarist, surprisingly opted to front her band without an instrument. Seemingly freed from that burden, she held the stage with a subtle anxiety that added urgency and importance to virtually every word she sang. The centerpiece of the performance was this powerful version of ”Underground.” Driven by a simple but infectious bass line, the song gives Schaefer room to sing  —   and can she ever sing. Through   verses and soaring choruses, she turned in one of the most impressive performances I’ve seen in years.  —  Jerad Walker, opbmusic, The prodigiously gifted Joanna Sternberg is one of the finest young bassists in New York, playing everything from jazz to klezmer with a multitude of artists. But she’s an equally powerful   who makes a virtue of simplicity paired with subtle subversion for maximum emotional impact. ”Don’t You Ever?” is a perfect example. In a voice as appealingly artless as Sara Carter of The Carter Family, Sternberg brilliantly blurs the line between the earnest and the ambiguous over some workmanlike acoustic strumming in this   home recording. Is the implied punctuation at the end of the chorus’s final line, ”Don’t you dare feel like you are alone,” a period or a question mark? Is this a consolation or a query? And is the admission ”I don’t feel right inside my body . .. never felt that I was a lady, never felt like a man” a statement about gender identity, a more broadly existential dislocation or something in between? The best answer would seem to be ”all of the above,” which is part of what makes the song so effective. And it’s Sternberg’s unvarnished expression of compassion and emotional unrest that gives the tune both its universality and its   quality.  —  Jim Allen, This   film by French cousins Jonathan and Guillaume Alric  —   who make electronic music and videos as The Blaze  —   will make you feel . .. something. It’s hard to predict exactly what because the video for ” Territory” is moving on several different levels. This wordless story of an Algerian man’s homecoming touches on generational schisms in Muslim families, modern depictions of Islamic communities, complex expressions of masculinity and the mental toll displacement can take on a person’s psyche. Those   threads are made all the more poignant by the Alrics’ stunning cinematography. Rarely do we encounter musicians so talented behind the camera. With just a   EP to their name, the Alrics are, both figuratively and literally, artists to watch.  —  Otis Hart, Oumou Sangaré is one of Mali’s most recognized singers. She grew up in a polygamous family and witnessed   the struggles of her mother, who was abandoned by her father. Her lyrics draw from her personal experience and often tackle subjects such as women’s rights and arranged marriage. But it is her voice that sets her apart  —   sweet, yet powerful. Sangaré sings in the Mali’s ancient Wassoulou musical tradition, yet her latest album, Mogoya, is an album of today. Layered and infused with electronic beats, drums, electric guitars and   vocals, the songs uplift you, enchant you and are guaranteed to make you dance. Sangare is also a businesswoman and a hotel owner, so she only records music when she has something to say, updating her sound on every album, never driven by demand.  —  Monika Evstatieva, During an    conversation in New York in early June, the electronic composer William Basinski asked Jerrilynn Patton, who produces abstract, highly rhythmic tracks under the name Jlin, about bass. Though her music often gets labeled ”footwork” (Chicago’s     scene) Patton said she actually doesn’t enjoy mixing in   nightclub environments, because the sound gets muddy and takes away from the controlled state she prefers. ”My style,” added the Gary, Ind. native, ”is CPU: clean, precise and unpredictable.” Black Origami, her second album, is full of   music that fits this description. Its   percussion is aimed less at the intoxicated proletariat dancing its pain away on a Saturday night than those who use precise improvisational movement to escape the contemporary world’s psychic gravity. (Patton regularly collaborates with professional choreographers, and her videos, including the incredible new one for ”Carbon 7,” embody the notion of improvised movement.) Compositions like ”Nyakinyua Rise,” ”Holy Child” (made with Basinski) and the title track seem like offspring of Steve Reich’s Ghanaian and gamelan adventures, the long lineage of Chicago’s great   minimalists and   drumlines, while her personal reinvention of the sampler makes tonal rhythm patterns sound like alien mathematics. Bass is often present, but it’s just a   of the larger whole.  —  Piotr Orlov, Few bands feel as vital as Algiers. That was true when frontman Franklin James Fisher and the gang hit the scene in 2012 with their      pastiche and it’s doubly true in 2017 with the group’s sophomore album, The Underside of Power. That vitality isn’t just a product of our current   climate it’s because the message and the music are so bound up together that it feels like an M. C. Escher painting. The weight of the lyrics is reinforced by the cultural and historical significance of the musical forms the musicians draw from. The instrumentation becomes more potent because of the way it serves Algiers’ message. That increases the gravitational field of the lyrics further, which beefs up the music’s virility . .. so on and so forth. Watch the video for the title track of the new album. Sometimes a music video can perfectly capture the essence of a song, but I’ve never seen one capture the essence of a band so perfectly. The moment during the breakdown when Fisher literally breaks down? It gets me every single time!  —  Sean Cannon, WFPK, If you were in your teens when   crossed over at the turn of the millennium, the reality that its classic lineup is probably never coming back feels a little like learning your high school crush is married: It shouldn’t matter, but it does, because the universe where things worked out differently still glows somewhere in your mind. That may not have been what motivated musician Cameron Hurley to arrange and perform a   Enema of the State pastiche, but he certainly carries it off with studied passion  —   enough so that even with one voice doing all the parts, it still reads decisively as a Mark Hoppus number with Tom DeLonge singing backup. Taking as its vessel the    ”Girls” by The 1975 (heirs to some of Blink’s impenitent juvenility) Hurley’s ”remash” as new. wav gets everything right about the source material: the dropout at the top of the chorus, that   blast beat that momentarily throws you out of the groove, the bridge breakdown whose layered vocals never quite work live but shimmer when they come out of a car stereo. We can’t have our youth or the culture that shaped it back, but we can dream.  —  Daoud   The universe where Juana Molina’s   single ”Paraguaya” exists is a very particular one. In the song’s hypnotic music video, disembodied heads coexist among bones stirring   coffee, jagged cake slices are cut, spooky shadow puppets dance at will and utensils levitate. It ends with a languid shot of Molina sitting down with another woman (her mother, Chunchuna Villafañe) for coffee and cake. The wondrous video invites all kinds of interpretations. But no matter what you think of ”Paraguya,” culled from the Argentinian musician’s latest album, Halo, this song is undeniably a deliberate confrontation with one’s own history, past and present. Listening to ”Paraguaya,” it’s impossible not to reexamine your own actions. The rhythmic quality of Molina’s music, reverberating with the low lull of a drone, ghostly electronic embellishments and the sparse plucks of a string section, suggests that this less a song than it is an incantation, both an inward and outward gesture that beckons towards healing. It’s also evident in Molina’s brilliant, alliterative wordplay, in which she invokes burning the herb rue and prepares a potion and prayer to recite on a moonlit night. Unsurprisingly, this challenging and centering song has become part of a ritual for me: Not a night goes by that I don’t listen to it before drifting off to sleep.  —  Paula Mejia, This year, Gabriel   released his debut album after several brushes with greatness. Jardin was three years in the making  —   the result, partly, of procrastination and partly of his analog recording method  —   and represents a gargantuan, brilliantly produced step toward that elite status. Every nook and cranny of songs like ”My Balloon” is occupied with sound, not just for the sake of filling space  —   listen to the way some instruments splash a faint but effective dash of color to the overall composition. On ”Long Ears,” he manages to make the sound of paper ripping sound funky. He performed at the Tiny Desk recently and stripped his entire production down to reveal vulnerability and clever word play. At the halfway mark of 2017, there have been dozens of projects and artists competing for my attention. Gabriel   and Jardin is the one that I continue to revisit and rediscover.  —  Bobby Carter,   years is a long time to wait for a new album from one of your favorite bands, especially a hometown group whose last record was widely declared album of the year when it came out in 2014. I’m talking about the incredible Philly band The War On Drugs. This past Record Store Day, it released the   track ”Thinking Of A Place,” a contemplative,          kind of song. It was a glorious return, though one couldn’t help but wonder: ”Where’s the rock! ?!?” But Adam Granduciel and his crew don’t mess around it was a great tease of a track, followed by ”Holding On,” an instantly anthemic,   classic. Within seconds, it grabs you by your rock and roll heart, giving faith to humankind that rock is not dead.  —  Bruce Warren, WXPN, When Tank and the Bangas performed at a taping of NPR’s Ask Me Another in April, I expected an impressive show. The band had just performed a spirited, emotional Tiny Desk concert a few weeks earlier, after winning the 2017 Tiny Desk Contest. Plus, the AMA show fell on my birthday  —   so my hopes were high. But when the band took the stage that night, it shattered my expectations. Tank and the Bangas commanded every ounce of attention in the room it was so enthralling that I kept sneaking looks at the crowd  —   a mix of public radio devotees and diehard fans of the band  —   just to make sure I wasn’t alone in my rapture. I wasn’t. I watched people cheer, sing and dance  —   even cry  —   but mostly, I watched them watch intently, similarly captivated. The songs ran through a range of emotions, and the band excelled at tapping into the deepest parts of each feeling  —   heartache, celebration,   joy  —   and pulling the entire crowd with it. Throughout the next month, I saw the band six more times on the tour that accompanied the Contest I never lost the sense of wonder I felt that night.  —  Marissa Lorusso, Talk to enough dance music lovers and you’re bound to hear some comparison between the club and church  —   the dance floor as a place to get in touch with something ritualistic, communal and spiritual. House music has a long relationship with gospel, and Karizma continues the tradition of chopping up a song made for praising God into one made for dancing. The influential Baltimore club producer loops the source material, ”Jesus Can Work It Out” by Dr. Charles Hayes  Cosmopolitan Church of Prayer Choir, over rough and ready percussion for a cut that radiates optimism. It’s sure to lift the spirits of dancegoers looking for something holy.  —  Sami Yenigun, The best of part of watching the Tony Awards every June is sneaking a peek at the nominated musicals, and this season was no different. Seeing Josh Groban (in his broadway debut) lead the cast of Natasha, Pierre  The Great Comet Of 1812, it was hard to believe the show did not take this year’s Best Musical prize. The musical (set in a Russian supper club and based on a passage from Tolstoy’s War and Peace) features 37 juggling,   specially skilled performers who leap further beyond the fourth wall than seemingly possible at the completely transformed Imperial Theatre on Broadway. Somehow the intimacy and theatrics of the production translated perfectly in the vastly larger Radio City Music Hall, as well as on network television. Cast members couldn’t resist flirting with audience members Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert and dragging composer Dave Malloy onto the stage to play out the   number, ”The Abduction,” for the rambunctious crowd of 6, 000 spectators. Breaking the fourth wall in a television broadcast is impossible, but this performance comes as close as any ever could. The only thing missing is Nicholas Pope’s immersive surround sound design in the Imperial Theatre, where the hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention on more than one occasion.  —  Josh Rogosin, Last month, John Moreland told a fan on Twitter, ”I ain’t country and I ain’t sad.” While the former can be infinitely debated and parsed, you can forgive the fan for thinking the Tulsa songwriter might be not the happiest guy. Heck, there’s an Instagram account dedicated to cheering him up, complete with images of pugs riding unicorns in space. I’m serious. Moreland’s   lyrics have a way of turning even the biggest and brawniest of us into a puddle of emotions. And his concerts are always a treat because the crowd actually shuts up and listens. Still, hearing the   ”It Don’t Suit Me (Like Before)” is incredibly refreshing. Its disposition differs from most of his prior material, but it’s not a cheery song. It shows a resolute Moreland moving forward, ready to leave the baggage and worries in the past. The accompanying music video follows him around at home and on the road with friends and his wife. You even catch a couple smiles from him in there. While Moreland’s last two albums sounded like he was searching for something, this song signals that he’s finally found it.  —  Ryan LaCroix, KOSU, There are five times in the bridge to The Smith Street Band’s ”25” that make me vigorously start pointing at the ceiling. Four of those times are directly related to the particular way Wil Wagner delivers lyrics with an affect that communicates both ”Punk is fun!” and ”I’m worried about myself.” (Example: ”AND IT SURE. IS. NICE. TO.  . THINGS. YEAH! ”) The fifth time is a production detail. On the drive back into the final chorus, there’s this *pew* sound expertly buried in the mix that seems to say ”Hey, warp speed to the pity party baby! It’ll be a blast!” It’s not wrong.  —  Andrew Limbong, Young Thug released ”Safe” as a single in February, and it didn’t make its way onto his latest album, Beautiful Thugger Girls. Instead, it stands alone  —   which is perfect, because it’s unlike anything else I’ve heard this year. ”I spend more money on security than I make just try to be safe,” goes the hook. And I’m stuck on it  —   because isn’t safety what we all desperately want for the people we love and the communities we care about? The song is best experienced by watching the video Young Thug certainly showed up for this one. It’s actually a   show in which he serves an emotional platter complete with fear, anger, vulnerability and whimsy. He glides around a sparse set, dancing by himself and at times looking directly, intensely at the camera. Like his signature vocal inflections, his movements and facial expressions hold multitudes. My favorite moment? At 2:23, when he skips backwards and fans his arms out over his head.  —  Jenny Gathright, 2017 so far for me is all about a Ralph Towner  . The guitarist, pianist and composer released his latest solo album, My Foolish Heart, in February. And this Friday, the group he   nearly 50 years ago, Oregon, will release what I think is its 30th album (counting a ”best of”). The solo record grabbed my ear from the first note because the playing is so strong  —   it’s all guitar, six and    —   and his finger work is assertive and full of energy. Turns out there’s a reason. A couple of years ago, Towner blacked out during a concert soundcheck. Doctors determined that his heart was beating too slowly, so he had a pacemaker installed. That trauma and its ultimate happy ending seem to have influenced Oregon’s new album, Lantern, as well. Though the only two original members are Towner (who also plays piano and synthesizer here) and woodwind player Paul McCandless, the music is alive and marked by the group’s trademark interactions. And the title tune is a free piece that reminds listeners that Oregon has always played challenging, out music and does not deserve the ”new age” label with which the group is sometimes saddled by jazz snobs. In a group that’s so collaborative, it’s hard to single out any one player  —   though McCandless sounds great. But for me, Ralph Towner’s the man.  —  Tom Cole, Arguably Xiu Xiu’s most   track yet, ”Wondering” from Forget is a collision of shrieking, wobbling synths, an unconventional assemblage of electronic and acoustic percussion, heavily reverberating crashes, and Jamie Stewart’s remarkable, fragile voice. I can confirm the catchiness and danceability by the way the whole room shook when Jamie Stewart  Shayna Dunkelman played it at the Brooklyn Bazaar last April. But what keeps me dancing isn’t the synth pop with syncopated percussion tricks. Stewart sings, ”Alive is anything   Tonight is anything   Outside of anything   Collide with everything . .. Down on your knees   Wondering, maybe?” The reeling synths and reverberant crashes echo his question. Wondering, maybe? To me, the song is about wondering at possibility, but it’s also about being overwhelmed, even floored, by the sheer feeling of wonder, even at life at its most banal. It’s about blinking twice and still being brought to your knees, stopped short, wondering at ”alive,” at ”tonight,” at ”everything.” This song still takes my breath away.  —  Jenna Li, If you hung around Boston’s   scene in the early 2000s, you experienced the phenomenal, yet fleeting solo career of Deb Talan. The writing on her last record, from 2004, cut to the core  —   but she was then becoming very focused on The Weepies, her band with husband Steve Tannen, and the band’s success made the possibility of another Talan solo release seem slim. Thirteen years, three kids, a victory over breast cancer and a bunch of unprocessed feelings later, Talan’s back with Lucky Girl, a project she undertook to regain lost pieces of her identity. Even when she’s pouring herself into emotional songs, Talan shows her lighter, funny side with playful lines like ”Son Volt came to town   I missed them again” (”Son Volt Came To Town”) and ”Daddy will take down Peter Pan from the shelf   And he’ll read it out loud, though you could read it yourself” (”Growing Up”). It’s always a gamble whether a project put down and picked up years later will be as good as your expectations, but Deb Talan has beyond exceeded mine.  —  Cindy Howes, WYEP  Folk Alley, The plaintive ”God In Chicago” appears at the midpoint of Craig Finn’s We All Want The Same Things, his third and most fully realized solo record to date. While it’s got all the characteristics of the best Hold Steady and Lifter Puller songs  —   when push comes to shove, I bet Wayne from Winnetka could hold his own with Charlemagne from ”Separation Sunday”  —   the track feels utterly singular in Finn’s body of work. With unsettling solemnity and uncanny deliberation, ”God In Chicago” befits a Midwestern winter, icy and foreboding. It comes not in hollers, but in hushed tones, hinting at desperation and hiding fresh wounds. It’s a short story of a song that’s fixated on specificity: that Mexican restaurant near Midway, a left turn on Cermak, the Walgreens near the Hyatt. ”God In Chicago” is an attempt at closure amid unfinished business and uncertain future.  —  Lyndsey McKenna, There are so many reasons why I love this multimedia music project inspired by Amazon’s stellar series The Man in the High Castle. Sure, the   compilation itself is grand (there’s virtually no way to beat   covers by Sharon Van Etten and Norah Jones) but it’s more than that. The campaign included a   stream of   radio hosts spinning cuts from the record as if the LP had been freshly pressed in the fictional 1960s of the show’s alternate timeline. Given the mix of contemporary artists playing   music on an Internet stream drenched in postwar   nostalgia, it’s easy to feel simultaneously stuck in the past and living in the present. But isn’t that how many of us feel these days? In 2017 radio can still be our lifeline the voices, our companions and the music, our reminder of the better and brighter (or darker and more haunting) things to come. Needless to say, Resistance Radio continues to give me goosebumps each time I tune in.  —  Joni Deutsch, West Virginia Public Broadcasting, The weeks leading up to the 2016 U. S. presidential election were challenging, to say the least. Tempers snapped. Arguments escalated. Suddenly, small differences of opinion seemed insurmountable. The realization that the nation was on the edge of a gargantuan chasm  —   not to mention the divisive tension he experienced within his own family  —   inspired Raul Malo to write ”Easy As It Seems,” one of the standout tracks on The Mavericks’ Brand New Day. A   with the band’s lead guitarist, Eddie Perez, and Alan Miller, ”Easy As It Seems” has its fair share of The Mavericks’ musical trademarks: it’s a catchy,   dance tune Malo’s voice is as crooningly romantic as ever and the horns and percussion work in perfect harmony. The sound might be comfortingly familiar, but ”Easy As It Seems” is an    —   a reminder that, no matter who you voted for, ”Ignorance is blinding   They tell you that it’s bliss” and ”Building walls between us doesn’t fix a thing.” Hopeful statements, I think, that encourage an   civil conversation with those whose opinions don’t match our own.  —  Elena See, Folk Alley, As ferociously iconoclastic as mainstream pop gets, Lorde’s Melodrama is a rare thing: a   to a huge debut hit that doesn’t just confirm a star’s status but redefines it on her own terms. Like the  ’90s work of Robyn, whom Lorde has cited as an influence, Melodrama (which is perfectly named  —   it’s an album about the   performance of huge emotional moments) is stuffed with extroverted songs about the inner life of an introvert. As a writer, Lorde has taken astonishing steps: She strings a narrative of a single party together over the course of the album’s 11 songs, and is able to draw your focus to crucial small details of personal attraction and betrayal, as well as the way the bright flame of an intense moment can flicker into the past and the future. She manages to stand both inside and outside the action, staring down the closing walls of adulthood, ready to bring her world crashing down before she gets hemmed in insulated by nighttime and justifiable bad choices and proximity to friends that might not be there in the morning or in five years. I don’t live in that place anymore my kids don’t live there yet. But I recognized it instantly, and I bet someday they will, too.  —  Jacob Ganz"
"The first death was on the night of Jan. 9. It was a Saturday. Pele Kristiansen spent the morning at home, drinking beers and hanging out with his older brother, which wasn’t so unusual. There wasn’t a lot of work in town. A lot of people drank. In the afternoon, they heard someone banging on their door, yelling. ”Polar bear! It’s a polar bear!” On the frozen fjord a couple of miles away, they could see the bear. Hunting in the Arctic  —   bears and reindeer and seals and birds  —   is at the core of Inuit life, even today. The polar bear was coming toward the town. A little drunk and really excited, Pele and his buddies fired up the motor on their fishing boat and nosed through the slushy ice in the harbor of their East Greenland village, Tiniteqilaaq, until they were as close as they could get. They got out of the boat, stood on the ice and pointed their rifles at the enormous animal. Among the Inuit, hunting a polar bear is a big deal. The bears have huge territories  —   to actually see one around Tiniteqilaaq was rare. And because of their size and ferocity, they’re not easy to kill. It’s usually a group effort, so according to tradition, the first four people to shoot it share the meat and the glory. That day, Pele shot the polar bear. And he was so happy. That evening, Pele went out drinking to celebrate. The next morning he was dead. He had killed himself. He was 22. Thirteen days later, in the next town over, a    boy named Peter Pilanat killed himself in his grandparents’ home. Peter and Pele didn’t know each other, at least not well, but they had friends in common. In a place with only 3, 000 people, Peter most certainly knew of Pele’s death. Two suicides in less than two weeks. To the people in these small towns, it felt like the beginning of something bad, something sickeningly familiar. Something that had happened too many times in too many towns in Greenland. A cluster of suicides, inexplicable and indiscriminate, tearing its way through the youngest generation in a country that has the highest known suicide rate in the world. When Anda Poulsen was young, he felt lucky. He had been born in a town with great history. Kangeq, Greenland, was a place people told stories about. It was famous for its strong Inuit hunters and good location on a point at the mouth of a fjord. It was where the first Scandinavian missionaries had settled, the first Greenlandic artists had painted and some of the last traditional Inuit kayak hunters had braved the ocean.  Kangeq was a place that made great men. Anda was proud. But Kangeq  —   which had survived a medieval drought and a   Little Ice Age, Vikings and missionaries  —   was about to meet a new and devastating foe. Anda was not going to be the hunter his grandfathers had been, and surviving into adulthood would be more difficult than he imagined. Greenland was a colony of Denmark (it still isn’t completely independent). After World War II, building on American wartime infrastructure on the island, Denmark decided it was time to develop the local economy. Greenland was a perfect place for commercial fishing, and there was potentially a lot of money to be made on halibut and shrimp. The Danish government brought in trading companies and trawlers. Within a few years, it was out with the kayaks and famous hunters, and in with the motorboats and fishing rights. The influx of money and new technology made some people richer, but it undercut the traditional Inuit economy in small villages, which was based on collective hunting and trading of meat and skins. As a child, Anda played near the abandoned kayaks along the shore. ”Wooden skeletons without covers,” he remembers. The new motor boats were only the beginning. Commercial fishing required fish processing factories. And those factories needed workers. Kangeq was too small for a real factory  —   only about 150 people lived there when times were good. Once the fish factories opened up in the capital, people started to leave Kangeq for the jobs, and for education. By 1974, only 50 or 60 people lived in Kangeq. And this is where things really started to fall apart for Anda’s hometown. He was 14 when it happened. By that time, he was living in the capital, Nuuk, where he and the remaining kids from Kangeq went to school. ”I heard that Kangeq was closing,” Anda says. ”Everyone heard. Everyone knew. It was very hard.” Kangeq was being erased. The Danish government was removing the village from the list of towns in Greenland. They were closing the store, shutting off the power, and reassigning the priest. From the government’s point of view, it was a purely practical decision  —   it was difficult to provide basic services like health clinics and schools to every tiny village. It would be much easier if the Inuit people moved to larger towns where the infrastructure was already in place. Anda’s family  —   his mother, his sisters, his cousins  —   had to pack their things and say goodbye to their   clapboard house overlooking the sea. Their new home in Nuuk would be in a concrete apartment block, with hundreds of other families from dozens of other small villages that had also been erased. ”My mother, my sisters and I all lived in a tenement building,” Anda says. It was in a   neighborhood near Nuuk’s growing harbor. The apartment blocks were symbols of progress, the authorities told them, luxurious examples of modern Greenland, with heat and power and plumbing and paved sidewalks outside. But Anda says the apartments didn’t feel luxurious  —   they felt foreign and lonely. The paved roads only separated them from the ocean, a barrier to the maritime hunting life they had depended on for thousands of years. Some tried to ignore the new setting and live as they had before. Anda recalls men hunting seals in Nuuk harbor in the afternoons, next to the Royal Arctic Line cargo ships, and dragging the meat back to their flats on children’s sleds. ”There was culture clash,” says Anda. And, perhaps even worse, ”there was prejudice against the people from the villages. You could feel it in their words, in the way they looked at you.” Anda, who is now 56, turns toward the window of his office in Nuuk. All his life, he has censored his anger and tried to focus on finding solutions. Still, the past hurts. He makes his hand into a fist, then lets it drop to the table. ”They mocked us.” For Anda, there were two choices. He could stay what he was, a village kid who spoke Greenlandic and didn’t fit in, or he could change and become a   city kid indistinguishable from the others. At school the message was clear:   were better than   Danish stuff was cooler than Greenlandic stuff. Village kids were inferior to city kids. ”I was good at integrating into my class.” He sighs. He knew he had to leave parts of his old self, his Kangeq self, behind. Or at least bury them beneath a more Danish exterior. ”That was how I survived.” He forced himself to adjust. But there were those who couldn’t adjust. The first death Anda heard about came shortly after Kangeq closed. The man was young  —   just 20. Anda knew his parents. Shortly after that, another family Anda knew found their teenage son’s body. A few years later, their other son killed himself. From the time Anda was 14 until he finished college, at least 10 people from Kangeq killed themselves. ”It was almost all the young men.” He places a hand over his heart. ”Very few of us survived.” The details blurred into one long, dismal memory of bodies found and parents crying and silent funerals where no one ever asked the question that everyone was wondering. Why? Anda wanted to know not just why the suicides were happening, but why no one was talking about them. And why wasn’t anything being done to prevent them? Who was helping the family members left behind? The only resource for people who were suicidal was a church hotline. Anda leans back in his chair and chooses his words carefully. ”For a lot of people, the priest was not who they want to talk to about their problems.” The church, after all, is an arm of the Danish government. Anda’s grief turned into something more like an obsession. He finished high school, had his first child. He wanted to help, but he still didn’t know how. He applied to college to study family therapy, got in and by the time he got his certificate, he was downright angry. It was unconscionable that Greenland would let an entire generation kill itself. He had to do something. There was one problem: There were no clear answers to any of Anda’s questions about why people were killing themselves or how to prevent it. Like native people all around the Arctic  —   and all over the world  —   Greenlanders were seeing the deadly effects of rapid modernization and unprecedented cultural interference. American Indians and Alaska Natives (many of whom share Inuit roots with Greenlanders) had already seen many of their communities buckle under the same pressures. In Greenland, the problem was only getting worse. Between 1970 and 1980, the suicide rate there quadrupled to about seven times the U. S. rate (it’s still about six times higher). The suicide rate was, and still is, so high that it’s not an exaggeration to say that everyone in Greenland knows someone who has killed himself. Many people I spoke with struggled to explain what that felt like, to live in a place where suicide is so pervasive, and most of them settled uncomfortably on the same word: normal. Suicide in Greenland, I heard over and over, is normal. People don’t mean it’s OK, just that it’s been so common for so long that the next death almost seems inevitable. By 1985, suicide was killing more people than cancer. That year, at least 50 people killed themselves in Greenland. The total population was only 53, 000. In the U. S. it would be as if in one year, the entire population of say, Lincoln, Neb.  —   more than 250, 000 people  —   killed themselves. And no one acknowledged it it didn’t make the papers. At that time, almost no one was studying suicide in Greenland. There were a few psychologists, but they were Danish, so it was impossible for Inuit people to get help in their native language. In therapy, each word matters. Plus, the stigma around suicide was intense. It was shameful. People who had lost children to suicide weren’t even acknowledging that fact to each other, it was so taboo. In the spring of 1989, Atsa Schmidt’s son had been dead for nearly a decade. Ujuanseeraq had loved acting and dancing. He ran a small theater group and was in school to become a mechanic. He had a lot of friends. But there were signs. He started telling his mother he was tired all the time, that everything he did felt too hard. Then, one day, he didn’t come home for dinner. The next day they found his body in the back of the theater. He was 21. Right after it happened, his suicide had been something Atsa discussed only with her closest family. It was a deeply private and painful part of her life. Even today, she doesn’t have any photos of her son in her home. So his death wasn’t really something she expected to come up at the grocery store. ”I was shopping for food at the Brugseni market in Nuuk,” she says, as if the geography of Nuuk in the ’90s is common knowledge. ”You know, the one that burned down.” Atsa was pushing her cart down an aisle when this young guy she knew through her cousins from Kangeq came up to her. ”He said, ’I’d like to talk to you for a minute.’ ” It was Anda Poulsen. There among the canned goods, Anda told her his plan. He was starting a support group for parents who had lost a child to suicide. He wanted her to come to the first meeting. ”I said that’s too much, I can’t do it.” But Anda, young and optimistic, replied, ”Of course you can! Of course you can do it. It will help you. You will see, it will help you. Come to the meeting with your husband.” ”So,” Atsa remembers, ”I didn’t really want to, but I went to the meeting.” At the first meeting, she met a handful of other parents whose sons had killed themselves. And found it was a relief to talk to them. The group met again, and then again. ”It was very clear that people needed help,” says Anda. ”And not just parents. People who were thinking about suicide, too.” Atsa started helping Anda. They hosted events together about suicide prevention, open to everyone. Less than a year after their conversation at the grocery store, Atsa Schmidt and Anda Poulsen decided to expand even further. They opened Greenland’s first national suicide hotline. It was an unconventional idea. They didn’t have the resources to hire professional counselors. Instead, they built on the resources they had  —     women who were good at listening. Atsa has no education at all, let alone a degree in social work or counseling, but she signed up to take the night shift. She knew she would end up with most of the calls  —   people don’t usually call suicide hotlines during the day. She had no idea if she would be able to handle it. ”I didn’t know what would happen,” she says. ”We didn’t know what to expect.” And yet, she felt sure that doing something had to be better than doing nothing. Atsa says her thinking back then was that a lot of people felt very alone. Just by listening, and acknowledging the pain, she hoped she could help. By sheer force of will, the hotline took off. Every night, Atsa kept the hotline cellphone next to her bed. For 18 years, she woke up in the middle of the night and talked to suicidal people. ”There were many people who needed help. That was clear.” Many of the people who called were young men who felt like they had no one to talk to. A lot of them had siblings or parents who had killed themselves. She would always start by telling them she wasn’t an expert, and she couldn’t give them medical advice. But, she would tell them, she had felt some of the things the callers were feeling, and she was there to listen. Sometimes, she’d read a prayer into the phone. The stress of the conversations was nearly unbearable. Her hands shook she fainted without warning. Her son complained she was spending too much energy on strangers. Her husband worried she wasn’t sleeping enough, working all day in a nursing home and answering calls all night. After a serious case of hives landed her in in the hospital, her doctor told her she shouldn’t work at the hotline for three months. She took his advice, but after three months she was back answering calls. ”I’ve talked to thousands of people,” she says. ”Even today, people I don’t know say thank you to me.” They are people who have called the hotline anonymously and recognize her even though she can’t recognize them. Atsa answered thousands of calls during her time on the hotline, and for her, there was a clear pattern behind Greenland’s suicides. Love, she says. Or, loss of it. We’re in her living room in Nuuk, surrounded by photos of her children and grandchildren. She’s 72 now and losing her sight. ”Some people, they are raised with a lot of love,” she explains, ”but some people are not. And these people who didn’t get love in their childhood, when they meet a partner, they try to hold onto him like they own him. They think that this one person, they can only love him and he is the only one who will ever love them. And when they break up, the person feels like their life is over.” Atsa thinks for a moment. ”Maybe I am giving them a little love.” Her observations are in line with something psychologists and sociologists think is fundamental to the causes of suicide in Greenland. When communities are disrupted, like Kangeq was, families start to collapse. There’s an increase in alcoholism, child neglect and physical abuse, all of which are risk factors for suicide. Later, people who didn’t get the love and support they needed as children find it difficult to cope with the routine heartbreak of dating, and a breakup becomes the final insult in a lifetime of hurt. ”There are a lot of negative consequences to rapid modernization,” says Greenlandic sociologist Steven Arnfjord. ”We’re still dealing with a lot of aftermath from policies of the ’70s and ’80s.” There’s also something broader  —   a loss of identity that happens when a culture, in this case Inuit culture, is demonized and broken down. When a culture is largely erased over less than a generation, as it was in Greenland, a lot of young people feel cut off from the older generations, but not really part of the new one. It’s especially difficult for young men, whose fathers and grandfathers were hunters, and who struggle to understand what it means to be an urban Inuit man. Without strong families and communities to help them cope, some of them are so overwhelmed and lost, they take their own lives. Fifty years after the suicide rate started to climb in Greenland’s capital, it appears to have plateaued, although it is still five times higher than in Denmark. For young people in Nuuk, the pain of assimilation and modernization still exists but is less acute. And while mental health resources are far from adequate, there are more than there used to be. But in the smaller towns, remote communities, the situation is as bad as ever. Julius Nielsen was standing right next to Pele Kristiansen on Jan. 9, when Pele shot the polar bear. ”There was so much adrenaline,” Julius says. ”I didn’t have a rifle, and I kept saying give me your rifle!” Julius was older than Pele and thought he’d have a better shot. But Pele kept the gun and shot the bear. Julius drops his head into his hands. ”Pele was so happy.” The two men were from the same tiny settlement of Tiniteqilaaq. Left behind by a rapidly urbanizing society, their home village retained the rhythms and traditions of an earlier time, when hunters were heroes. The polar bear was a rare enough occurrence that everyone in town celebrated well into the night on Saturday. On Sunday Julius woke up early, around 5 a. m. feeling good. The weather looked clear enough for seal hunting. He fed his sled dogs in the morning light and went back home for a cup of coffee. Then, at 8, he got a call from Pele’s brother. ”Stupid, stupid Pele,” he said. ”He killed himself.” ”You’re joking,” Julius said. ”Look out the window,” the brother said. When Julius looked out, he could see Pele’s older brother standing next to his icebound fishing boat anchored in the tiny settlement’s frozen harbor. ”He was just looking at me.” Julius grabbed his jacket and pulled it on as he ran down to the ice. ”We had the best Saturday, and the worst Sunday.” Julius covered his friend’s body with a tarp and called the police. Tiniteqilaaq is 25 miles from the largest town in east Greenland, Tasiilaq. Although families and hunters go back and forth all the time, the route between the two places is nonetheless remote, includes a glacier crossing and can be treacherous. That particular weekend, there was already 3 feet of snow on the ground. It took the police officer, a young Danish man still new to the area, all day to travel from Tasiilaq by snowmobile. When he arrived in the evening, it was already dark and snowing again, and he found he couldn’t communicate with the dead man’s family, who spoke only Greenlandic. Julius had to translate. The police officer told the family that a doctor would need to examine the body before it could be buried. There were no doctors in Tiniteqilaaq, so they’d need to bring one from Tasiilaq. By now the snow was too deep. They’d have to wait for a helicopter. They moved Pele’s body to the health clinic, which also serves as the town meeting house, hotel, post office and church. The nurse there was Pele’s aunt. She couldn’t bring herself to clean the body, so Julius did it himself. He cut Pele’s favorite dress shirt down the back and tucked it around his friend’s stiff body, trying to make it look as neat as he could. Pele Kristiansen was buried on Friday, Jan. 15, 2016. Dozens of people from Tasiilaq went to the funeral. All that next week, people were walking around in a daze, trying to explain the inexplicable to themselves and to their families. Julius’    son had loved spending time with Pele. They went   and played video games together. He kept asking his father how someone who seemed so happy could kill himself. ”It’s just not possible to explain,” Julius says. Pele had never mentioned suicidal thoughts, had never attempted suicide before, at least that Julius knew of. And yet there was no way his death was an accident. He had definitely killed himself. ”I don’t know why and I can’t explain why,” Julius said to his son. ”I’m sorry.” He told him that as much as it hurt, eventually he would learn to live with Pele’s death. A few days later,    Peter Pilanat killed himself. That death brought with it a new fear: Was this the beginning of a suicide cluster?  Sometimes, suicides can start chain reactions. Psychologists call it the contagion effect or suicidal transmission  —   after a close family member or friend kills himself, people who are already having suicidal thoughts are at greater risk for suicide. For that reason, suicide clusters or waves are especially likely in small, isolated communities where everyone knows each other. In one study from Greenland, 60 percent of young people who killed themselves did so within four months of another suicide in the same district. Still, it’s impossible to know why this particular    boy killed himself in Tasiilaq. But whatever the reason, after two suicides in two weeks in a place with fewer than 3, 000 people, a lot of people felt as if a vicious cycle was restarting. It had happened before in Greenland. There was the wave of teenagers who killed themselves in Illulissat around 2004. A slew of deaths that swept through school dormitories in the ’90s. The disaster in Kangeq. ”To be a parent in this case, you feel very powerless, helpless,” Julius says. Two of his children had gone to school with the dead boy. Privately he started to question whether he felt safe keeping his kids in school in Tasiilaq. Despite having the highest suicide rate  —   more than 400 per 100, 000  —   of any town in Greenland, Tasiilaq does not have a psychologist. Nurses and social workers and therapists there do their best to counsel suicidal residents, as do psychologists 500 miles away in Nuuk, who can talk to patients over a video connection. But Greenland’s Ministry of Health acknowledges it does not have adequate resources, and a lot of people in Tasiilaq say that when they report a suicidal friend or family member, nothing happens. Back in the capital, the recent pair of suicides weren’t even on the radar of the Ministry of Health. But the municipal government had heard about them. Kristian Rosing, the coordinator of suicide prevention for the region, started rearranging his schedule in case he had to go to Tasiilaq. It takes a full day to travel from Nuuk to Tasiilaq, first on a small propeller plane, then on a helicopter. The flights are about as likely to depart as they are to be canceled, and in the winter there are only two flights a week. A   ticket costs about $1, 000. ”I had planned to visit Tasiilaq in the fall,” Rosing says, ”but when I heard about the deaths, I thought my boss might send me sooner, to teach the kids how to cope with the suicides. Teach them how to prevent another one.” The first people the regional government sent in, though, were grief counselors, a social worker and a family therapist. Their job was to help families get through the next few weeks. Espen Christiansen, a teacher at the school, remembers the first day back after the    had killed himself. He looked out at the dead boy’s classmates and he didn’t know what to say. Their eyes were red from crying. ”We were mostly silent. They weren’t talking very much. I thought it was most respectful to just be quiet, too.” After lunch, some of the kids wrote down their feelings in letters addressed to their dead classmate. Christiansen helped them make a shrine on Peter’s desk, with candles and ribbon. ”I told them they could go home if they wanted to, but they stayed,” he said. ”I think they didn’t want to be alone.” At this point, it had been about two weeks since Peter killed himself. In Nuuk, Rosing’s boss told him it was time to get to Tasiilaq  —   as soon as possible. Rosing is a constitutionally honest man. He is the first to admit that he is not particularly   for his job. His original training was as a shopkeeper’s assistant, and a few years ago, he took a   course in administration, although at that point he had already been in charge of suicide prevention in a smaller region for many years. He spends most of his time going to different schools and teaching teenagers and people who work with kids how to talk about suicide. He was nervous about the trip. Usually, he follows a curriculum that involves speaking very bluntly about suicide, even to kids. He does exercises where students have to brainstorm reasons a person might kill himself or asks them to pretend to be a suicidal person in a  . He had never used the curriculum with kids who had just lost a friend. ”These kids, they are very fragile,” he said. ”I was worried about how they would react.” He decided to go with what he had, and hope it would help rather than hurt. A full month after Peter died, at 8:30 in the morning, Rosing puttered restlessly around the back of the community hall in Tasiilaq. The    —   the classmates of the boy who had killed himself  —   were due any minute for their first day of suicide prevention instruction. He had bought heaps of bread and cheese and jam for breakfast for the almost 60 kids he was expecting. As they trickled in by twos and threes, he smiled silently and gestured to the table full of food.      Uitsatikitseq was antsy as soon as he walked in. He was still thinking about his friend’s funeral, and he knew he was going to be asked to talk about suicide. He finished his bread, fumbled with his napkin, then pulled out his cellphone. Rosing saw the phone and walked over. ”Put that away, please,” he said. Then, more gently, ”You know this is important.” He put his hand on  ’s shoulder until the boy pushed the phone down into the pocket of his jeans. The first assignment was to get into groups to brainstorm reasons that a person might kill themselves. The other boys in  ’s group messed around with a paper football.   bent over the paper and, in haphazard pencil, scribbled out 10 reasons. The first one said Loneliness. Being lonely for long time. Being lonely in whole life. Number three read simply Love. Not every exercise went as well. In the middle of a video about suicide and child abuse, one girl simply got up and left the building. A teacher went running after her. Another boy refused to write or say anything and just sat in the back of the room staring at his hands. After the first day, about a dozen kids didn’t come back. But many more did. After a few reprimands about wearing earbuds, most of them listened to Rosing. His message was more about life than about death. He talked about how hard it can be to feel alone and sad in a small town. He urged them to talk to each other about their feelings, good ones and bad ones, and then he had them act out those conversations. On the last day, the kids got diplomas that said Suicide Prevention Life Course Participant. It had gone well, he thought. Or, at least it hadn’t gone terribly wrong. A few weeks after his trip to Tasiilaq, Rosing is hunched in his undersized desk chair. When he talks about his time there, he sounds nothing but depressed  —   despite his apparent success helping the kids there talk about suicide. ”I don’t think I can prevent another child from dying in Tasiilaq,” he says. ”I know it will happen again.” Last year, before the suicides happened in Tasiilaq, Rosing almost quit his job. ”I had just had enough,” he says, of going into school after school, town after town, hearing stories about pain and loss and desperation, and then, inevitably, hearing later that another child or young person had died by suicide. It was exhausting and frustrating and isolating. ”For me, it is very lonely work. Even though I have colleagues, I feel alone.” Rosing says that to fix the underlying problems in Tasiilaq  —   the alcoholism and joblessness and poverty and child neglect  —   it’s going to take money and manpower. For a start, the town needs a   psychologist,   teachers, more social workers, and a serious jobs program to employ educated young people who return home after getting their degrees elsewhere. As does every other town in Greenland. All 100 or so of them, sprinkled around the coast of the largest island in the world. ”Twenty years,” he thinks. ”If we do everything we can, it will be 20 years.” That long to get the suicide problem in Greenland under control. Twenty more years before what happened in Kangeq long ago stops happening in Greenland. It’s something Anda tries not to think about in his    life. Between his job as a family therapist and raising his three kids, he’s always busy. ”There are always more families who need help,” he says. ”Plus, I have my own family. My own children to take care of. It’s stressful.” A few years ago, Anda Poulsenfound an unexpected outlet for his stress. More than two decades after he forced himself to assimilate, Anda rediscovered traditional Inuit drum dancing, which celebrates hunting and being near the ocean, and started a group called the Nuuk Drum Dancers. Now, at least once a week, he sings and dances with his sealskin drum. ”When I feel sad or angry, I drum dance,” he says. In his search for a way forward, Anda Poulsen is reconnecting with the past. And he hopes his children will be allowed to express their Inuit identities in a way he was not. ”I think the future will get better and better for them.” In the summer, Anda takes his children back to Kangeq, where the colonial wharf is slowly collapsing and the old store stands empty. Sometimes, while they fish and play among the abandoned houses, he takes his drum up the hill and closes his eyes and dances.

"Free Comic Book Day  Free Comic Book Day, the comics industry’s yearly attempt to bring new readers into the fold, is 15 years old. It’s a peevish teen that smells of Speed Stick and Clearasil and a practiced, performative surliness. It demands that you drop it off a block away from school. For the past eight years, I’ve written a preview of the comics on offer on Free Comic Book Day for NPR. So I’m kind of like Free Comic Book Day’s annoying   little brother, always chasing after him and telling everyone how cool he is. And he  —   it  —   is very cool: Once again, this Saturday, if you walk into your neighborhood comics shop, they’ll give you some free comics. You can find your closest shop by typing your ZIP code into the Comics Shop Locator on the www. freecomicbookday. com page. The usual caveats apply: As someone who has now looked at eight crops of FCBD books over the years, I can say that year’s selection is heartening and reflects the (incremental and  ) progress the comics industry’s been making over the past few years. By which I mean: realizing that there’s an audience besides horny straight fanboys. This year, you’ll find more   titles than ever before, fewer superheroes, and more books featuring female protagonists, practically none of whom are busty   who choose to engage in strenuous melee combat while wearing corsets. (When I say ”practically no,” I mean there’s one.) The  : more books tied to licensed properties, which are always a mixed bag. Publishers approach Free Comic Book Day in a variety of ways. Some FCBD comics offer a   tour though a given publisher’s many titles  —   let’s call these samplers. Others present a   story, or a selection of stories, about one specific character  —   let’s call these singles. Samplers are a canny marketing move, but in casting such a wide net they can offer a    reading experience. Sometimes you want the steak, not the charcuterie board, you know? Singles give you a truer sense of a given comic’s storytelling bona fides  —   what can its creative team accomplish in 23 pages?  —   but there’s more pressure on them to deliver. The FCBD site groups the books on offer every year using a rating system that parents may find helpful, though there’s an awful lot of wiggle room built in. Which makes sense: After all, you know your kids and what they’re ready for better than any publisher could. So if, say, the distinction between a TEEN and a TEEN+ book seems a bit nebulous, here’s a handy guide to clip and stick to the refrigerator: As a general rule:  : It’s fine. TEEN: Don’t worry. TEEN+: Worry a little. MATURE: You let your kid read this? Monster! Got all that? OK. Let’s start with the   comics.     ALL AGES: Samplers, BOOM! 2016 Summer Blast, Genre: Various, Anything I Need To Know Going In? A mix of     (Labyrinth, Mouse Guard, Adventure Time) and excerpted selections (Lumberjanes, Goldie Vance, The Cloud). Anything Else? The excerpt from The Cloud, an upcoming graphic novel, is intriguing if a bit opaque. Like,  ’  ’     ’  . Looks great, though. The excerpt from Goldie Vance (a girl hotel detective) and the Mouse Guard story (a gorgeously wrought tale of a mouse who wants to learn the language of other beasts) are standouts. Verdict? Yes. Dark Lily  Friends, Genre:   Fiction, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Four excerpts: Dark Lily is a gothy moon princess, Monster Elementary has li’l versions of Universal monsters navigating public school, Rocket Queen and the Wrench is the story of a teen   and her male sidekick, and Mage, Inc. features a young woman interning at a magic business. In a canny move, the publisher includes a brief introduction to each excerpt that gives readers the basics. Anything Else? Rocket Queen and the Wrench would be a great name for a D. C. hardcore band. Also, Monster Elementary is a riot. Verdict? Yep. Doctor Who, Genre:    Fiction, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Four short stories featuring four different Doctors. Anything Else? A shining exception to the rule that licensed   comics tend to suck. These stories  —   particularly the first, starring the 12th Doctor  —   really capture the snap and spirit of the show. Verdict?  . (That’s a yes.)    Sports  Genre:   . .. Sports Fantasy? Anything I Need To Know Going In? Hilda is a girl in a Northern European town who has adventures with creatures of Nordic myth. Akissi, set in the Ivory Coast, follows a troublemaking young girl and her brother. Fantasy Sports is . .. just exactly what the title says it is, believe it or not: not leagues and rosters and draft picks, but a melding of wizards and warriors with . .. baseball. Anything Else? Luke Pearson’s Hilda and Marguerite Abouet’s Akissi are both charming. Sam Bosma’s Fantasy Sports is a tougher nut to crack, from this excerpt, but the art can’t be beat. Verdict? Sure.   Howard Lovecraft and the Frozen   Unknowns, Genre: Adventure, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Howard Lovecraft follows a young H. P. Lovecraft, his pet Cthulhu (”Spot”) and his   friends. The Unknowns are a rock band who are secretly alien cops. Anything Else? Both stories feel like the    for animated series that they are, and the publisher makes no bones about that. The Lovecraft tale’s the more visually inventive (there’s a character who speaks in emojis, basically) but the Unknowns story lays out their origin in eight energetic, albeit   pages. Verdict? Yeah, why not?   Legend of   to Train Your   vs. Zombies, Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Comics based on two animated series and a cellphone game, just like Will Eisner always dreamed. Anything Else? The Korra tale reveals how she first met Naga, the Train Your Dragon story features the cast telling campfire tales, but it’s the Plants vs. Zombies vignette that’s the real find here. Inventive and idiosyncratic in a way   comics rarely are, it’s told in a   style and features an ending that’s actually funny. Verdict? Yes.   Overstreet’s Comic Book Marketplace, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? The publishers of a   annual comics price guide produce an   offering every year, and this one seems especially packed: retrospectives on Star Trek, Civil War, The Spirit, Supergirl, Archie, as well as primers on collecting movie posters and other bits of pop culture ephemera. Anything Else? Said retrospectives are quite brief, and are little more than   tours through history, but there’s something for everyone here. Verdict? For the    yes.   Pokemon Pocket Comics, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? ”Your favorite Pokemon from the Unova region like you’ve never seen them before!” Uh . .. I don’t have a favorite? What’s the Unova region? And I’ve never seen them before, period? Anything Else? Look, this isn’t for me. Basically it’s a series of   gag strips featuring different characters from that insanely popular game that slyly indoctrinates preschoolers into the world of  . Includes a quiz with questions like ”Which of the following Pokemon is heavier than a Hoothoot?” (. .. I scored 1 out of 11.) Verdict? Yes, if you or your kids like Pokemon. If you or they don’t, this reads like an urgent pictographic message from an alien race that really enjoys watching cute things whomp the snot out of each other. Sanjay and   Beaks, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Comics based on Nickelodeon animated series. Sanjay and Craig: kid and his pet snake. Harvey Beaks: bird with several animal friends. Anything Else? Both are cute, though Sanjay and Craig has a distinct visual style that sets it apart. Verdict? Yep. Science Comics, Genre: Educational, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Cartoonist Maris Wicks recounts how her lifelong love of the ocean led her to create a comic about coral reefs a young woman on a cold, dead future Earth researches volcanoes in an effort to save humanity. Anything Else? Clever writing and smart design make potentially dry topics engaging by spotlighting the passion of the scientific pursuit (the coral reef story) or placing information in a compelling dramatic framework (the volcanoes story). Verdict? Yes.   Sonic Sampler, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Selections from ongoing comics series about a Hedgehog who runs fast and the surprisingly and astonishingly dense narrative universe around him. Anything Else? No, that about covers it. Verdict? If you’ve ever played a Sonic game and thought, ”I’d enjoy this experience more if it was a series of static images laid out in a grid,” then yes. ALL AGES: Singles, Awake, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Could young Regn, gifted with power to communicate with planets, truly be the one to save the world? (Ya think?) Anything Else? As a question on which to hang a tale, ”Could she truly be . .. The One?” is, let’s just admit to ourselves, getting a bit musty, but the art is appealing and the setup (which is this issue’s job) is interesting. Verdict? Yes.   Bob’s Burgers, Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? A series of vignettes and pinup art based on the excellent TV series. Anything Else? Really nails the show’s voice: ”We can’t go back, Tina! We’re cave people now. We rely on rats for food, warmth, and yes, companionship.” Verdict? Definitely, yes. Bongo    Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Buncha stories about The Simpsons, told in The Simpsons style, set in the world of The Simpsons. Anything Else? Dependably The Simpsons. The FCBD equivalent of an old, comfortable shoe. Or a   glove. Whichever. Verdict? Yep. Bruce Lee: The Dragon Rises, Genre: Martial   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Bruce Lee’s daughter commissioned this new   series ”to introduce my father and his amazing legacy of action and philosophy to a whole new generation.” Anything Else? Can’t speak to the philosophy, but the action is  . Add a central mystery, and some surprisingly solid humorous dialogue, and this is off to a great start. Verdict? Yes. Camp Midnight, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Excerpt from a graphic novel in which a smartass human girl is mistakenly sent to a summer camp for monsters. Anything Else? Lots to chew on here. Expressive art, with distinctive use of color. A main character who finds herself in a putatively terrifying situation and just . .. rolls with it. Grapples with some interesting themes about what it means to fit in, and what our ”true self” is. Makes a nice companion to Monster Elementary, in the Dark Lily comic, above. Verdict? Yep.   DC SuperHero Girls, Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Excerpt from DC’s new line of   graphic novels featuring clever redesigns of their female characters. Anything Else? Stories starring female superheroes you can feel good about handing to a young girl? It’s about damn time. (There’s also a toy line, you will not be shocked to learn. Which may explain the vague,      feel of the book. Even so: Its mere existence is long overdue, and welcome.) Verdict? Yes. Dream Jumper, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Ben’s a kid who dreams about being chased by vampires sporting eyepatches,   doctors, and various other monsters. Anything Else? That’s really all you get from this excerpt, but the art is friendly and expressive. Some nice flashes of humor. Written by actor Greg Grunberg, based on dreams related to him by his son. Soon to be adapted into an animated film. Verdict? Sure. Grumpy Cat (and Pokey!)  Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? We license memes now. Memes are exploitable intellectual property that’s where we are as a society. The Internet sensation known as Grumpy Cat extends her 15 minutes with these tales of backyard adventures with her chipper friend Pokey. Anything Else? Some solid jokes in here, though the shadow of Garfield looms over every frame. Verdict? Better than expected. Yes. Help the CBLDF . .. DEFEND COMICS, Genre: Mixed, Anything I Need To Know Going In? The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is a nonprofit that helps creators, publishers, educators and librarians when they come under fire for comic book content. This issue offers a selection of vignettes that (literally) illustrate the need for comics to be able to tell stories as their creators wish. Anything Else? Unsurprisingly, some sections work better than others. Lucy Kinsley’s recollection of London’s Speaker’s Corner resists seeming   owing to the brightness of her artwork. Other selections fare less well. Verdict? The CBLDF does good work that’s worth supporting. With your  . Junior Braves of the Apocalypse, Genre: Horror, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Excerpt from a new series of graphic novels in which a troupe of boys returns from a camping trip to find the zombie apocalypse in full swing. Anything Else? Zach Lehner’s black and white art straddles the line between cartoony and creepy. Might be a bit intense for very young kids. Verdict? Maybe. If you can still read the word ”zombie” without rolling your eyes, yes. Mooncop, Genre: Science   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Tom Gauld is a brilliantly funny, brilliantly nerdy U. K. cartoonist, and this issue features an excerpt from his upcoming graphic novel Mooncop, as well as a selection of gag comics from his collection, You’re All Just Jealous of My Jetpack. Anything Else? Gauld’s deceptively simple style, which reduces human interaction to affectless stick figures, really works in Mooncop, a graphic novel about . .. exactly what you think. In the future, a   police officer rescues dogs and automatons. And Gauld’s deadpan,   gag strips really shine. Verdict? Highly recommended. Oddly Normal, Genre: Fantasy, Anything I Need To Know Going In?   Oddly Normal, the daughter of a witch and a human who ignore her, is unpopular in school for having green hair and pointed ears. And for being named ”Oddly Normal.” Anything Else? This is how you do FCBD. We get the first chapter of Otis Frampton’s graphic novel, which kicks things off with bang, and he offers glimpses of what’s coming. You’ll definitely want to see more. Verdict? Yes. The Phantom, Genre: Superhero, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Reprints of old Charlton Comics tales of everyone’s favorite Purple Perambulating   the Phantom. Anything Else? Jim Aparo’s art is stunning, propulsive and good    . Usual caveats apply, re: talking to your kids about how our notions of how to depict ”jungle folk” have evolved since these stories were first printed. Verdict? Yes. The Pink Panther, Genre: Humor, Anything I Need To Know Going In? New and classic adventures of Hawley Pratt  Friz Freleng’s cerise jungle cat. Anything Else? A new story, in which Pink inherits the Hammer of Thor, is wordless. In the classic, reprinted tale, however, he’s downright voluble. Also features an ”Ant and the Aardvark” vignette, who it just occurred to me were voiced on the old TV series as Dean Martin and Jackie Mason   respectively. Because ’70s kids wanted cartoon characters that sounded like they could play the Vegas Strip, I guess? Verdict? Some nice, efficient visual storytelling in the new story yes. Spectrum, Genre: Science    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Follow me here: Actor Alan Tudyk wrote, directed and stars in a Web series called Con Man, in which he plays an actor who used to be on a cult   TV series called Spectrum. This book? Which he  ? Is the beginning of a   comics series that adapts that fictional show. Got all that? Anything Else? Given that both this book’s Web series inspiration and Tudyk himself possess some serious comedy DNA, this is a surprisingly grim,   overture to the space opera to come. The story: The Earth has gotten its butt serially handed to it by several alien races and attempts to fight back. Verdict? The events depicted kind of chafe against the ” ” classification, for me. More death and destruction than some parents might be comfortable with. It’s all setup, so it doesn’t so much offer a satisfying read as bait the trap. Which of course is a perfectly valid approach to FCBD. So: Maybe? SpongeBob Freestyle Funnies, Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? The continuing adventures of America’s favorite idiotically chipper and resolutely absurdist bath supply. Anything Else? A nice mix the publishers allow different artists to adapt their distinct styles to the characters, so the five tales avoid looking stiff or  . Verdict? Yes. Strawberry Shortcake, Genre: Cuteness, Anything I Need To Know Going In? You mean besides the fact that Ms. Shortcake owns the Berry Bitty Café in Berry Bitty City? And that her friends Sweet Grapes and Sour Grapes persuade her to throw a party and to go get her hair done at Lemon Meringue’s hair salon? And that high jinks dependably ensue? . .. No, yeah, that pretty much covers it. Anything Else? Young kids may like the bright colors and simple story all others may wish to pour themselves a frosty mug of insulin before venturing in. (Also includes a series of dossiers on Berry Bitty City’s residents, from its resident blogger, Apple Dumplin’ to fashionista Raspberry Torte.) (BTW: According to said dossiers, Sour Grapes ”likes to spice things up with her realistic and zesty attitude!” I feel like Sour Grapes would be great to get a mug of insulin with I bet her life in Berry Bitty City is one long uninterrupted  . Girlfriend has stories to tell, you can sense it.) Verdict? Lookit: Raspberry Torte has a Chihuahua named Chiffon, we learn. If learning this fact stirs something in you or your kid, pick this up. The Stuff of Legend, Genre: Fantasy, Anything I Need To Know Going In? A young boy’s toys  —   including a teddy bear, a     a piggy bank and a toy soldier  —   enter the darkness of his bedroom closet to rescue him from the Boogeyman. Anything Else? The fifth volume of the series will soon be published. If you’ve picked up a Stuff of Legends FCBD book before, know that this year’s edition once again excerpts the first chapter of the first volume of the series. There’s an appealing and very intentional disconnect between the book’s   tone and its   art, and a clever,   central conceit (once they enter the closet, the toys become very real). Verdict? Still a great introduction to a great series. Yes. The Tick, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? He’s big, dumb, blue and indestructible, and his battle cry is an eating utensil. Anything Else? A breach in the multiverse has   versions of Tick rubbing shoulders and antennae with one another, endangering all of existence. Lacks the   of previous FCBD issues, but this is always a dependably solid pickup. Verdict? Yes. Worlds of Aspen 2016, Genre: Fantasy, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Aspen is a comics publisher that, historically at any rate, offered FCBD offerings filled with exquisitely rendered   warrior women given to posing in ways that risked spinal torsion. Thus every year, it managed to introduce itself to new potential readers as a company still stuck in 1993. Here, it dials the cheesecake down a bit (a bit  —   there’s still a completely random bikini shot, because fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly) and the result is heartening. Anything Else? The company’s various titles are converging in a massive crossover of worlds and characters. This makes as good a   point as any. Verdict? For the first time in the eight years I’ve been reviewing Aspen’s FCBD comics: Yes. (Though again, flip through it to see if you agree with the ” ” designation it claims on the FCBD site.) Best Bets,  : BOOM! 2016 Summer Blast Dark Lily  Friends Doctor Who Hilda Science Comics Bob’s Burgers, Bongo Comics    Bruce Lee  —   The Dragon Rises Camp Midnight DC Superhero Girls Grumpy Cat (and Pokey!) Mooncop Oddly Normal The Stuff of Legend, TEEN, TEEN: Samplers, Attack on Titan Anthology, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Attack on Titan is a hugely successful manga series by Hajime Isayama, which became a giant (heh) anime series. In October, a variety of Western artists will contribute to an anthology set in the AoT world. This book features tiny excerpts from that. Anything Else? Attack on Titan is potent nightmare fuel: Humanity defends itself from deeply! creepy! giants by retreating into walled cities. We only get very brief glimpses of the various creators’ takes here, but they evince notably distinct approaches. Verdict? Again, this is the sampler conundrum: not much to chew on, but awfully pretty. Yes. 2000 AD, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need To Know Going In? The U. K,’s     comics anthology series offers new and classic tales with a harder edge than much of what you’ll find on FCBD tables this year. Includes QR codes for more free digital comics and a music file, so in terms of    (  )  this is the best ”value” of the day. Anything Else? As always, 2000 AD offers a decidedly mordant, violent, and dark collection that really leans into the ”   as morality tale” storytelling scheme. Verdict? Yes, if you or your kid prefers a little grit in your gumbo. Comics Lab! !! Genre: Mixed, Anything I Need To Know Going In? A decidedly mixed bag, from bright, peppy Power Rangers pastiche to what looks to be a tale of pets and wildlife fighting back against Lovecraftian horrors to a deeply meditative, True   vignette where Something Goes Wrong in the Desert. Anything Else? As a taste of the widely varied   at publisher Z2 Comics right now, it’s great. As a reading experience, less so. Verdict? The Welcome to Showside superhero parody is a standout. Worth picking up for that. Mix Tape 2016 (Mercy     Relations) Genre: Various, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Mercy Sparx is a girl demon who can take care of herself in a rough city. Badger is a superhero who gets in an MMA match with Vladimir Putin. Squarriors are squirrel warriors (you probably could have figured that out yourself) and Public Relations is about a flack who does crisis management for a firm faced with true, albeit fantastical, crises (like dragon attacks). Anything Else? We’re squarely in Teen territory now. Rougher stuff, in every sense  —   including some cringeworthy Japanese dialect (”Amelican win! Laise hand now! ”) that would shame Breakfast at Tiffany’s Mickey Rooney. But the Public Relations story has some nice moments. Verdict? Mmmmaybe.       Hero Academia, Genre: Superhero manga, Anything I Need To Know Going In?   Man is a bored hero who can defeat any enemy with . .. you know, one punch. My Hero Academia follows a young boy trying to master his powers in a school for the superpowered. Anything Else?   Man is pretty fantastic, really. Even in this brief excerpt, the tightly controlled tone and pacing build to a very funny climax. My Hero Academia manages to distinguish itself from its very familiar setting with smart writing. And also with a kid who shoots a laser out of his bellybutton. So. I mean. Verdict? Of course.      Man, Genre: Science    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Three, count ’em, THREE series based on action figures. ROM the Spaceknight was a hilariously cheap electronic toy of the 1970s who starred in a   if fondly remembered, Marvel comic. Action Man was the U. K. version of GI Joe who starred in a U. K. comic in the ’00s. Both are getting rebooted.  Anything Else? The Transformers component of this FCBD issue is little more than a   infographic that explains how the many Transformers comics relate to one another. Useful? Sure. But as a reading experience, less than compelling. Verdict? Skippable, unless you’re a ROM completist. Typing that sentence just made me want to lie down.      Genre: Science   (s) Anything I Need To Know Going In? The Serenity and Hellboy stories are   vignettes, but the Aliens story seems to be an excerpt. Anything Else? The scripts are the real deal  —   by Chris Roberson, Mike Mignola and Brian Wood, respectively. They’re pros who know how to pack a lot into relatively small spaces a very satisfying read. (The way the issue riffs on Serenity canon is particularly fun.) Verdict? Definitely. Valiant 2016, Genre: Science Fiction, Anything I Need To Know Going In? A selection of excerpts from various titles across Valiant’s publishing line, including the   about series Faith, starring a superhero who is both a woman (which is no big deal) and      (which still really kind of is). Anything Else? Big ideas abound, and the selections from each title are legitimately tantalizing. Faith is charming, as promised the 4001AD title features strong writing and art Divinity boasts a fascinating premise and I’ll definitely be picking up a copy of Archer  Armstrong #1 based on the humor and verve present in this excerpt. Verdict? Highly recommended. Singles, Archie, Genre: Humor, Anything I Need To Know Going In? This is a freshly rebooted, less cartoony ”New Riverdale” version of America’s favorite     teen ginger. (Fear not,   : Classic Archie hasn’t gone anywhere and still lives in the supermarket checkout aisle, as always.) The broad slapstick is gone (as is the    hairstyle) replaced by a more measured, but still breezy, tone. Script by Mark Waid, art by Fiona Staples, so Riverdale’s in good hands. Anything Else? There’s also an excerpt of the excellent new Jughead title, written by the dependably goofy Chip Zdarsky and winning art by Squirrel Girl’s Erica Henderson. Verdict? Run, don’t walk. Yes. Assassin’s Creed, Genre:    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Two stories that spin off the popular video game franchise. A female Assassin in 1791 Haiti, and a Templar (the Assassin’s enemies, in game lore) in 1927 China. Anything Else? The Templar story’s a solid,   (heh) adventure, but the Assassin tale seems a bit talky to serve as an effective introduction. Verdict? For fans of the series, yes. For others, skippable. Avatarex: Destroyer of Darkness, Genre: Superhero, Anything I Need To Know Going In? Two related excerpts from writer Grant Morrison and artist Jeevan J. Kang’s series Avatarex (about the 10th incarnation of a godlike Indian superbeing) and 18 Days (about a prehistoric conflict between clans of superwarriors). Anything Else? It’s Morrison, which means huge, trippy and blithely ambitious. The Avatarex excerpt is boldly realized and easy to follow the 18 Days segment, set in the   to what Morrison, in a predictably Morrisonesque forward, calls a ”  ” is a bit inscrutable. Verdict? Morrison is always worth a look, though not always a deep dive. Pick it up, and see where you land. Lady Mechanika, Genre: See below. Anything I Need To Know Going In? Goggles, gears, hilariously complicated firearms: This is steampunk. But wait: main character’s boobs spilling over the top of her corset like she’s one of those squeezable executive stress toys: This is cheesecake. It’s steampunk cheesecake! (Another good D. C. hardcore band name.) Anything Else? ”Lady Mechanika, the infamous mechanical huntress!” says the villain of the piece, admiringly. She’s had her arms replaced with robot parts, and her memory wiped, and . .. yeah, you get it. Verdict? For those that like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing that they like. Love and Rockets, Genre: . ..   ? Is that a genre? Can it be? Anything I Need To Know Going In? Just in time for a fourth, new series of Love and Rockets books coming this summer  —   only the latest addition to a sweeping tale produced over the past 34 years  —   this FCBD comic provides an excellent sample of what makes the book so influential and unforgettable. Anything Else? The brothers Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez each write separate sagas: Gilbert’s (originally set in a fictional Central American town and now relocated, like its main characters, to Los Angeles) revolve around a woman and her extended family. Jaime’s epic follows the travails of Southern Californian   rockers attempting to hold on to their youth. The characterizations are mature and nuanced, the design spare and effective. A masterpiece of comics storytelling. Verdict? The first book you should pick up. It’ll go quickly.   March, Genre:   Anything I Need To Know Going In? Congressman John Lewis’ early life, and his pivotal role in the civil rights movement, is chronicled in the excellent   graphic novel series March. This issue features gripping excerpts from each book. Anything Else? By turns harrowing and inspiring, Lewis’ story is told with   unsentimental power. Artist Nate Powell captures both the chaos of the times and the resolute spirit of Lewis and his fellow activists. Verdict? Absolutely.   Street Fighter V, Genre: Martial    Anything I Need To Know Going In? Excerpts from the comics starring the various characters in the Capcom fighting game. Anything Else? They show up, they fight one another, they say things like ”Whatever business you’ve got with my friend, just take it elsewhere before you get caught up in a TURBULENT WIND!” Verdict? If you can read the words ”turbulent wind” without snickering, this is probably a book for you.   Suicide Squad, Genre: Super( )hero, Anything I Need To Know Going In? DC supervillains recruited into a   strike force. Implanted with miniature bombs that will kill them if they don’t obey orders. Anything Else? My oh my oh MY but this is unpleasant! Torture on Page 1, burned child corpses on Page 9, electrocution, dismemberment . .. ad infinitum, ad nauseam. The best part? It’s soon to be a major motion picture! Based on an ’80s series I loved as a kid. This? . .. Isn’t that. Verdict? Look, make your own decisions, but just know that in the grand scheme of what comics as a storytelling medium have the potential to achieve, this is pretty repellent. (Why does this get a Teen rating, and not a Teen+? That, friend, is a penetrating and insightful question.)

"Donald Trump laid out a series of campaign promises and leveled a slew of accusations at rival Hillary Clinton on Wednesday. Read more about the speech here. NPR’s politics team (with some help from our colleagues on the international desk) has annotated Trump’s speech, below. Portions we commented on are bolded, followed by analysis and   in italics. We will update further. The speech follows: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Today I’d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this upcoming and very important election. People have asked me why I’m running for president. I built an amazing business that I love. And I get to work side by side with my children every single day. We come to work together and turn visions into reality. We think big, and then we make it happen. We absolutely make it happen. I love what I do. And I’m grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it. So when people ask me why I am running, I very quickly answer: I’m running to give back to this country, which has been so very good to me. When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, for that matter, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton. Only by me. The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can’t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created the problems themselves. We’ll never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who have rigged it in the first place. The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money. That’s why we’re asking Bernie Sanders’ voters to join our movement. So together we can fix the system for all Americans. So important. This includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals. And they are disastrous. They are destroying our country. Because it’s not just the political system that’s rigged, it’s the whole economy. It’s rigged by big donors who want to keep wages down. [Trump himself has said during this cycle that wages are ”too high.” He said it in a November debate in response to a question about raising the minimum wage, then repeated the point the next day on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Since then, he has walked that comment back, telling Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd in May, ”I have seen what’s going on. And I don’t know how people make it on $7. 25 an hour.” He added that he would like to see an increase, but that states  —   not the federal government  —   should do it.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] It’s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the United States with absolutely no consequences for them. [Trump has expressed great outrage over trade deals leading to the offshoring of American jobs. But when it comes to his own   products, the vast majority are made overseas.  —   Tamara Keith] It’s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools. It’s rigged against you, the American people. Hillary Clinton, and, as you know, most people know, she’s a   liar. Just look at her pathetic email server statements, or her phony landing. Or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack. And the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers. A total and so  —   look, this was one of the beauts  —   a total and   lie.  [The Washington Post Fact Checker did an excellent piece on this. And, yes, it was a   whopper. In AP video from the time, she does appear to be holding a bouquet of flowers.  —   Tamara Keith] Brian Williams’ career was destroyed for saying less. [Brian Williams did lose his post as anchor of NBC Nightly News, the network’s signature program. He’s now an anchor on MSNBC. Their inaccurate claims about being under fire in aircraft were remarkably similar.  —   Tamara Keith] Just remember that. Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. [True, she did.  —   Tamara Keith] But here, and this is the way it is, is the bottom line. I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion.  [It depends on your definition of small. Trump says the loan was $1 million, which by most standards is not small. Additionally, the Washington Post Fact Checker finds that Trump benefited from significantly more help than that from his father, a successful real estate developer.  —   Tamara Keith] And that’s the kind of thinking we need in our leadership of our country. I’ve always had a talent for building businesses, and importantly, for creating jobs. That’s a talent our country desperately needs. I’m running for president to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first. It’s about time. We’re going to put America first. And we’re going to make America great again. This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people or by the politicians. Here is my promise to the American voter: If I’m elected president, I will end the   monopoly in Washington, D. C. Very important. [Trump has said that he loves ”the idea of campaign finance reform” and regularly decries the influence of money in politics, but he has yet to outline how he would ”end the   monopoly in Washington, D. C.” His website does not list campaign finance reform, money in politics or checking the influence of lobbyists in the section devoted to issues. His campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was formerly a partner in a successful lobbying firm.  —   Tamara Keith] The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests. And, I will tell you, she’s made plenty of money for them. And she’s been taking plenty of money out for herself. Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft. She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund, doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, and, really, many, many others, in exchange for cash. Pure and simple, folks. Pure and simple. Then, when she left, she made $21. 6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests. And, in less than two years, secret speeches that she doesn’t want to reveal under any circumstances to the public. I wonder why. Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001. [According to CNN, the Clintons did earn $153 million in speaking fees since 2001. Bill Clinton earned the bulk of that money. Hillary earned $21. 7 million TOTAL. According to CNN it was just $1. 8 million  —   still not tiny  —   which came from big banks. It’s unclear where the rest came from (Trump would argue it was all some sort of ”special interest”) but it seems the bulk was not from Wall Street, as Trump is clearly implying.  —   Will Huntsberry] They totally own her. And that will never, ever change. Including if she ever became president, God help us. The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering, really, the last scrap of independence to the total and complete control of people like the Clintons. Those are the stakes: Hillary Clinton wants to be president. But she doesn’t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders said very strongly, the judgment to be president. She does not have the judgment. She believes  —   She believes she’s entitled to the office. Her campaign slogan is ”I’m with her.” You know what my response is to that? I’m with you, the American people. Thank you very much. She thinks it’s all about her. I know it’s all about you. I know it’s all about making America great again for all Americans. All Americans. Our country lost its way when it stopped putting the American people really first. We have to go back to putting our American people first. We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, focusing on what’s good for America’s middle class, to a policy of Globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries, all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy itself. We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. They get punished. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats. This is a wave of globalism that wipes out our middle class and our jobs along with it. We need reform, and we have to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together and America can become rich again. We have to make America rich again. And that’s what I mean by America first. Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again. Bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to the shores. [According to a report from Michael Hicks, Ball State professor, 9 out of 10 manufacturing jobs have been lost to mechanization, not trade policies. ”No matter how you measure it, 2015 was the record year for manufacturing production in the USA. Right now manufacturing in Indiana and the USA is at record levels. There’s no ambiguity on this. . .. To be sure, our trade deficits have cost us manufacturing jobs. The   estimates are that today we have 1. 5 million fewer manufacturing jobs across the nation because of foreign trade. All the other 6 million or so lost manufacturing jobs are due to mechanization, better technology and better production practices. Today’s typical factory workers make twice as much ’stuff’ in an hour as they did in 1977. For every manufacturing job lost to trade, nearly 9 have been lost to machines. But trade also creates jobs. We have 7 million more transportation and logistics jobs alone, likely attributable to trade, since the 1970s.”   —   Will Huntsberry] I mean, we have to bring our manufacturers back to the United States. Desperately needed. Desperately, we need those jobs. And we need it even from our psyche. One of the really great things and one of the first major bills that George Washington signed was  —   amazing, when I saw this for the first time  —   the encouragement and protection of manufacturing in America. Our first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying: The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people. In other words, we have to protect our country. I have decided and visited cities and towns across America, all across America, and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And it’s total devastation. All over New York. All over Pennsylvania. All over New England. All over the country. Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton’s disastrous and totally disastrous NAFTA. Just like she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. [It’s very hard to tease out the exact effects of NAFTA because of the many economic factors at play. However, by several nonpartisan analyses, it is not ”disastrous.” In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office characterized the 1994 agreement as having a ”very small positive effect on U. S. gross domestic product.” A 2015 study from the Congressional Research Service likewise characterized the effect on the economy as ”relatively small” and also noted that it’s difficult to put exact numbers on the effect. They added, ”In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters.” One additional bit of context: It’s true that trade deals, broadly speaking, are sometimes disastrous on the micro level  —   that is, a trade deal can be disastrous for a person whose job is moved to another country. But on the macro level, trade deals often provide broader, less readily visible benefits (like cheaper goods for U. S. consumers).  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We’ve lost nearly   of our manufacturing jobs since these two   agreements were signed. [U. S. employment in manufacturing has dropped by 27 percent since January 1994 when NAFTA took effect. Since 2010, jobs in manufacturing have seen a slight uptick.  —   Tamara Keith]  Among the worst we’ve ever done. Among the most destructive agreements we’ve ever signed. Our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state. A disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned. [The U. S. trade deficit with China grew by approximately 39 percent from 2009 to 2012, the years that Clinton was secretary of state. However, it would be hard to put much responsibility for U. S. trade policy and the imbalance on the secretary of state.  —   Tamara Keith] As the AP pointed out when Trump attacked Clinton on the U. S.’s trade deficit with China, ”In her role as the nation’s top diplomat, Clinton had no direct control over the difference in the cost of U. S. imports from China versus its exports to the nation.”  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Then she left China  —   so true. Then she left China and what happened is billions and billions of dollars in our intellectual property, and China has taken it. And it’s a crime which is continuously going on and is going on right now. They are stealing billions and billions of dollars of our intellectual property. Hillary Clinton gave China millions of jobs, our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich. The book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America’s expense. She gets rich making you poor. Here is a quote from the book: At the center of U. S. policy toward China was Hillary Clinton. At this critical time for U. S.  relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters. These funds were paid to the Clintons’ bank account directly while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States. Tell me, folks, does that work? She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing. Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the   Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission. Now, because I pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she’s pretending that she’s against it.  [Proving causation here would be nearly impossible. But it is highly unlikely that Trump’s criticisms of the   Partnership had anything to do with Clinton’s movement on the matter. Bernie Sanders was putting pressure on Hillary Clinton to oppose the TPP as well as   authority before Trump even announced he was running for president. Labor unions whose support Clinton sought strongly oppose the deal as well. As a candidate, Clinton resisted taking a position one way or another on TPP until negotiations were completed. Then, in October, one week before the first Democratic presidential debate, her campaign weighed in, saying she couldn’t support it in its current form.  —   Tamara Keith] She’s given, and deleted, as you know  —   and most people have heard about this. Have we ever heard about her deleting anything? No, I don’t think so  —   she deleted the entire record from her book. [This has been widely reported, including here.  —   Tamara Keith] And deletion is something she really does know something about, because she’s deleted at least 30, 000 emails. Which, by the way, should be able to be found. Should be able to be found, because the government  —   I will say, I’ve always heard, you can never really delete an email. So it should be able to be found, if they really wanted to find them. But I don’t think they want to find them. This is the latest Clinton   and it doesn’t change anything. If she is elected president, she will adopt the   Partnership. [Clinton has said she is opposed to the TPP  —   or, more clearly, her campaign has said she’s opposed to it ”in its current form,” and that it needs changes to bolster jobs, wages and national security. However, she wasn’t always opposed to the agreement. As secretary of state, she had characterized it as ”the gold standard” of trade agreements. In October 2015, when she came out against the deal, CNN counted 45 instances in which she had previously spoken in favor of the deal.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] And we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She’ll do this and, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career  —   and it will be even worse than the Clintons’ NAFTA deal, and I never thought it could get worse than that  —   we will lose jobs, we will lose employment, we will lose taxes, we will lose everything. We will lose our country. I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and for our workers. We don’t make great deals anymore. But we will once I become president. I promise you that. It’s not just our economy that’s been corrupted but our foreign policy, too. The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions and trillions of dollars and unleashed ISIS across the world. No secretary of state has been more wrong, more often and in more places than Hillary Clinton. Her decision spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims of our late ambassador Chris Stevens  —   I mean, what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. When the phone rang, as per the commercial, at 3 o’clock in the morning, Hillary Clinton was sleeping. Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate, they needed help. Hillary Clinton’s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die. To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about the video being the cause of death, the famous video. [In marathon testimony to a congressional committee last year, Clinton said she had ”lost sleep” and had been ”racking my brain over what more could have or should’ve been done.” But she said she relied on   officials to make determinations about a security presence at the compound and had not personally denied any requests for more security there.  —   Carrie Johnson] All a lie. Another Hillary lie. Here’s what one of the victim’s mother had to say: I want the whole world to know it. She lied to my face. And, you know, this person cannot be president. She cannot be president. In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world. Libya was cooperating. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, believe it or not. Syria was under control. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty Israel. Something very nice because, by the way, Israel has been totally mistreated by the United States. ISIS wasn’t even on the map. Fast forward to 2013. In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost   destabilize the entire Middle East. Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS  —   the barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton’s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen, while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West. [The Arab uprisings of 2011 included peaceful demonstrations in Syria. But President Bashar Assad’s security forces began attacking protesters, and the clashes rapidly escalated into a civil war. President Obama was extremely wary of direct U. S. involvement, and his administration was criticized for not taking stronger action in the first few years. U. S. forces began bombing the Islamic State in Syria in 2014, well after Clinton left her post as secretary of state. Clinton has generally supported similar, if slightly tougher positions, than Obama has. She has called for intensifying the current bombing campaign and has advocated measures such as a   zone. She has opposed sending U. S. ground troops. The Islamic State began emerging in its current form in 2013  —   as Clinton was leaving office  —   and made its most spectacular territorial gains in Syria that year, and in Iraq the following year.  —   Greg Myre] She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt, and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control. But Clinton has opened the Pandora’s box of radical Islam. Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS and the ISIS killers. ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama. ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality. And who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety. In short  —   In short, Hillary Clinton’s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another. One by one, they’re all bad. She’s virtually done nothing right. She’s virtually done nothing good. It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the war in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war. And, yes, even before the war ever started. [Politifact has rated this claim as False, saying it ”didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began.” In fact, in September 2002, he told Howard Stern, ”Yeah, I guess so” when questioned as to whether he supported the invasion of Iraq.  —   Jessica Taylor] But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq. Because when she got into power, she couldn’t wait to rush us off to war in Libya. She lacks the temperament and the judgment and the competence to lead our country. She should not be president under any circumstances. In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office, somebody that saw her a lot . .. [According to a Politico report, the Association of Former Agents of the U. S. Secret Service has put out a statement questioning whether that agent could possibly have been stationed where he said he was stationed, and whether he could have seen what he claims.  —   Tamara Keith] . .. and knows her probably better than almost anybody: ”She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.” Her leadership style, volcanic, impulsive, disdainful, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else, hasn’t changed one bit. Perhaps the most terrifying thing of Hillary Clinton’s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by radical Islam. In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States. And that’s an increase over President Obama’s already high number. [Politifact has rated this ”mostly true”  —   Clinton said during a September 2015 appearance on Face the Nation that she wanted to increase the number of Syrian refugees allowed in to somewhere between 10, 000 to 65, 000 people. In 2015, the U. S. allowed in about 2, 000. So that would be more than a 500 percent increase.  —   Jessica Taylor, As NPR’s Michele Kelemen has recently   the high number of refugees that Trump claims the Obama administration is allowing into the country is described as more of a trickle by activists working on behalf of refugees.  —   Arnie Seipel] Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from. [This repeats a claim that Trump made in his speech right after the Orlando attacks, which was false. There is indeed a lengthy system in place, which begins with the U. N. identifying people as refugees. Their names and fingerprints are then run through criminal and terrorism background checks, and are   with classified material. The entire process takes about one to two years.  —   Jessica Taylor] Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the United States. [A 2015 Migration Policy Institute study found that just three resettled refugees had been arrested on terrorism charges, though this depends on the definition of ”refugee”  —   for example, it did not count the Tsarnaev brothers of the Boston Marathon bombing because they had been brought to the U. S. as kids after their parents had been granted asylum. Politifact found that ”about 140 migrants have been charged with or are credibly believed to have been involved in jihadist extremist activity in the United States since the World Trade Center attacks. Some number more  —   up to a maximum of 184 additional individuals  —   are children of immigrants.” Those are incomplete, so it’s unclear how large the numbers are.  —   Jessica Taylor] The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive   and   regimes on Earth. [In an interview with CNN, the shooter’s father condemned the Taliban, and CNN reported that one of the quotes where it seemed he had sympathized with the terrorist group had been  . He called these groups ”the enemy of humanity.”  —   Jessica Taylor] I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people. Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death. Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1, 000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department. Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States. Thank you. So true. Here is some of really what we learned from the book in addition to what we’ve already discussed: A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran and other oppressive regimes. So, what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750, 000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash. The telecom company escaped all sanctions.  [Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer alleged a corrupt link between a Bill Clinton speech and a State Department decision. Clinton gave the speech in November 2011, and was paid $750, 000 by Swedish telecom company Ericsson. The following week, the State Department said it wouldn’t sanction telecom companies doing business with Iran. Schweizer qualified the allegation on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, saying, ”Is there evidence of a quid pro quo [a felony] in that case? No, I’m not saying that.”  —   Peter Overby] Hillary Clinton’s state department approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton foundation  —   $145 million. Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with   access, even though he had no national security credentials  —   although he did make a very large campaign contribution. Hillary Clinton accepted $58, 000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state, plus millions more for her foundation. [Clinton accepted the jewelry, but it went to the State Department, as required for gifts worth $350 or more that are presented by foreign governments. (It’s in the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.) Brunei gave between $1 million and $5 million to the foundation. Trump’s next two points also refer to foundation money.  —   Peter Overby] The sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment by death and stoning if you happen to be gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiary of Hillary’s   Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. Hillary Clinton’s book, just think of this  —   the book talks about it, but look: Hillary Clinton took $25 million from Saudi Arabia, and much more from others, where being gay is also punishable by death. [Politifact and the Washington Post have reported that the Clinton Foundation took donations from Saudi Arabia and the UAE after Clinton left the State Department.  —   Arnie Seipel] Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and the LGBT citizens. [The Clinton Foundation and the administration drew up a memorandum of understanding that Politifact reports stipulated that ”the foundation would seek approval from the State Department’s ethics office before accepting donations from new foreign interests that hadn’t given in the past, or from past donors who upped their contributions from previous levels.” Kuwait, Qatar and Oman all were allowed by the terms of that memorandum, per Politifact.  —   Arnie Seipel] To cover up her corrupt dealings, Hillary illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server. She’s under investigation, but it seems like nothing’s going to happen. Even though other people who have done similar things but at a much lower level, their lives have been destroyed. It’s a rigged system folks. It’s a rigged system. Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments, perhaps even by her financial backers in communist China  —   sure they have it  —   putting all of America and our citizens in danger, great danger. Then there are the 33, 000 emails she deleted. While we may not know what’s in those deleted emails, our enemies probably know every single one of them. [The FBI and Justice Department are investigating the security of Clinton’s private server but have made no public determination about its legality. The State Department inspector general recently concluded Clinton had not sought permission for the server, and officials would have denied it had she asked. There’s no evidence the server has been hacked by foreign governments, although emails contained in the IG report reflect at least two attempts by hackers to infiltrate it.  —   Carrie Johnson] So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be the president of the United States. This fact alone disqualifies her from the presidency. We can’t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies. Can’t do it. National security is also immigration security. And Hillary wants neither. Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States. She’s pledged to grant mass amnesty and, in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement and . .. [Depends on your definition of amnesty. From the Clinton website: ”she will focus enforcement resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and work to ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U. S. have a fair chance to tell their stories.”  —   Tamara Keith] . .. thus create totally open borders for the United States. [Clinton is not calling for totally open borders. From her website: ”As president, Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a full and equal path to citizenship, treats every person with dignity, upholds the rule of law, protects our borders and national security, and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy.”  —   Tamara Keith] Totally open borders. And, by the way, 16, 500 border patrol agents have endorsed Donald Trump. First time in the history that they’ve endorsed a presidential candidate. The first victims of her radical policies will be poor   and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They’re also the ones that she will hurt the most by far. Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Anne Mendoza. She lost her amazing son, police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of open borders and policies supported by Hillary Clinton. Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate. Here’s an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza’s letter: Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harm’s way. An   policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I. She’s only concerned about the power of the presidency and the power that it would bring. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes that she’s already committed against our country. That’s from Mrs. Mendoza. Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to settle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States on top of the current record level of immigration that we already have. [Per the Migration Policy Institute, granting of legal permanent resident status is way down from its peak in the late 1980s. According to Pew, illegal immigration had leveled off as of 2014. And specifically, Mexican immigration fell dramatically from  .  —   Sarah McCammon] For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America. Hillary’s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans totally out of work. She can’t claim to care about   and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new   earners to compete against them and win against them. Because the system is rigged against our people. Here are a few things a Trump administration will do for the Americans, and for the American people, but for our country. No. 1, the first 100 days, I’ll appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution of the United States. Hillary Clinton’s radical judges will virtually abolish the Second Amendment. Can’t let that happen. I will change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good, really   jobs. We don’t have good jobs anymore. These will be   jobs. We’ll stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many. We’ll cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas and everywhere else but our country. We’ll lift restrictions on energy production. We will repeal and replace   Obamacare. It is a total disaster. We’ll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone. And we are, by the way, the highest taxed nation in the world. Please remember that. [Not true. Out of 34 OECD countries, the U. S. has the   top marginal income tax rate. As a share of GDP, this doesn’t stack up, either. U. S. tax revenue equals around 26 percent of the nation’s GDP. The OECD average as of 2013 was around 34 percent. If Trump is talking about corporate taxes, he is closer to correct. The U. S. has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, according to the Tax Foundation, a   tax policy think tank. As of late 2015, the U. S. had the   top marginal corporate tax rate in the world, behind Chad and the United Arab Emirates (though the UAE has discretion on which businesses pay that tax rate, per the Tax Foundation).  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We’re going to impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the office of the secretary of state. There is one common theme in all of these reforms. It’s going to be America first. This is why stakes in November are so great. On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people. The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don’t need or want another Clinton or Obama. We just can’t take it anymore. So bad for our country and our people. Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity and sold out their country. And I mean totally sold out their country. They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda, with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people. Hillary Clinton’s message is old and tired. Her message is that things can’t change. My message is that things have to change, and that this is our one chance and maybe our only chance to do that change, and if we don’t do it now, folks, I don’t know that we’ll ever, ever have another chance. We have to have change, but real change, not Obama change. Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system, that built the great dams and so much more. Then we really started thinking small. Something happened. Something happened to our mentality. We started thinking small. We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people and other institutions. We lost our sense of purpose and daring. But that’s not who we are. Come this November, we can bring America back. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before. We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet Earth. The roads and railways and airports of tomorrow. Our military  —   Our military, which has totally depleted, will have the best technology and the finest equipment. We will bring it back to the way that it must be. Strong, strong, strong. Massive new factories will come roaring into our country, breathing life and hope into our communities. Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally, finally, finally be rebuilt. Construction is what I know. I say nobody knows it better. The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years. [Trump appears to be talking about median household income here. As of 2014, it was $53, 657, a sizable drop from 1999’s $57, 843. That 2014 figure is the lowest median household income has been since 1996.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] But these wages will start going up along with new jobs, jobs, jobs. Hillary’s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone. And that’s what’s been happening. And that’s why you’re seeing so many people coming to our rallies and so much unbelievable support. We’re also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement. We can never forget the great job they do. Thank you. I’m also going to appoint great Supreme Court justices, so important, one of the most important factors in this election. Going to have many appointments. Could be as many as five, could be three, could be four. One of the really big factors in this election, we are going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will be outstanding. Outstanding. So important. Our country is going to start working again. Jobs. People are going to start working again. Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again, including parents in our inner cities. Americans, Americans, the people that we love, Americans. America first. Make our country great again. Americans are going to start believing in the future of our country. We are going to make America rich again. We are going to make America safe again. We are going to make America great again. And great again for everyone. Everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it."
"Do we even need July through December? For a year just reaching its midpoint, 2016 has already been the most. Heartbreaking, surprising, idiotic, ecstatic,   exhausting. With apologies to whatever happened in the first week of January, the wild mood swings of the last six months started for music lovers the weekend when David Bowie released his final masterpiece, Blackstar, and then disappeared into eternity two days later, leaving us all gasping. The music world, as it has done for four decades, attempted to follow in his footsteps, and even if that feeling of whiplash was matched only once (R. I. P. Prince) or twice (Lemonade or, maybe, the conversation about Lemonade) loving music in 2016 has meant wrestling with more than the sound itself. But there has been plenty to love. Enough that we had to expand this list, our annual     from 25 to 30 albums. We present them to you in alphabetical order, as a gift, an offering, an occasion to take a moment and catch up with something you may have missed before we turn the corner and barrel headlong through summer, toward November, December and whatever in the world lies beyond. LANGUAGE ADVISORY: Some of the songs on this page contain profanity. At the start of the year, in the dead of winter, Anderson . Paak released a flawless summer album. If the young rapper made a wave with his   features on Dr. Dre’s Compton in 2015, he caught it on his sophomore solo release. In a deep rhythmic pocket, . Paak forged 16 songs that belong as much to Dr. Dre’s   as they do to Kendrick Lamar’s California conscious rap, but they’re unmistakably . Paak’s own. This is an auteur’s album, with his stamp on every part of it. Rapping, singing drumming and producing, he pulls from the histories of RB, rap, pop (he even namechecks Hall  Oates) and old surf movies for an ecstatic, immersive toast to the West Coast. These lucid grooves owe a debt to Motown especially, bringing Marvin Gaye to mind with grooves at once   in their assemblage and effortless in their flow (”The Waters” features BJ the Chicago Kid, who’s breathing new life into the storied label). This is irresistible pastiche, and the glue is Anderson . Paak’s irrepressible will to celebrate  —   a spirit bright like summer, and deep like the ocean off Malibu.  —  Benjamin   Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, On Antony And The Johnsons’ albums, Anohni infused her songs with a kind of brittle warmth, marked by notes of hope and a belief in survival. On her appropriately titled Hopelessness, however, love and the darkest possible world affairs are conflated to form a fatalistic worldview in which devastation is not only inevitable, but practically fetishized. Here, the weight of the world’s cruelty and injustice is so much to bear, Anohni can’t help but approach it from odd and unexpected angles: In ”Watch Me,” the surveillance state is cast as an obsessively watchful lover for whom she pines in ”Execution,” she begs, ”Please don’t have mercy” in ”4 Degrees,” she wants to watch the world burn in ”Drone Bomb Me,” the pleas are evident in the title. Set against harsh, gnarled electronics, her words don’t go down easily. But that’s the farthest possible thing from the point.  —  Stephen Thompson, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Amazon   Bandcamp   Tidal, In Israel, the music, language and culture of the Mizrahi Jews  —   whose family roots are in   countries of the Middle East  —   has long been overshadowed. But with their debut album, the three sisters of   (Tair, Liron and Tagel Haim) celebrate the legacy of their ancestors from Yemen, with their distinct culture and   dialect of Arabic. Even the band’s name is a callback to that shared culture aywa means ”yeah” in Arabic. But the trio isn’t looking to just preserve old sounds: instead, these Haim sisters catapult this roots material with bracing, quirky,   harmonies that float over electronic beats. Aywa!  —  Anastasia Tsioulcas, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, The synergy between music, words and performers rarely rises to the extraordinary level found here in Danish composer Hans Abrahamsen’s   song cycle, let me tell you, which features soprano Barbara Hannigan with Andris Nelsons conducting the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The text, by Paul Griffiths, adopts all the words (about 480 of them) Shakespeare allotted to Ophelia in Hamlet, shuffled to create a fresh, confident character with cracks of fragility. Sung by the fearless Hannigan, Ophelia divides her story into past, present and future, speaking of a time without music, the inadequacy of language and a transformative love. When she sings ”you have   me,” the orchestra shatters into twinkling shards of sound. The final scene finds Ophelia calmly walking out into the falling snow. Hannigan’s high C, plucked from the frigid air, might be the most beautiful note you’ll hear all year.  —  Tom Huizenga, Who but the Queen of Fierceness could have released an album whose impact on public discourse would exceed that of any other recent   event  —   sorry, LeBron and Captain America  —   this year, when the album is supposed to be dead, its encompassing magic disabled by the streaming economy and our shattered attention spans? Lemonade is Blonde on Blonde for the women who know how to get that perfect shade, Exile on Main Street for the communities of color who’ve felt the effects of internal American exile their whole lives. From the minute the deeply complex ”visual album” version aired on HBO, fans claimed Lemonade as the culmination of a  ’s worth of   women’s   connecting Toni Morrison’s visions to the striking imagery in films like Daughters of the Dust to the subversive celebrity of current icons like Serena Williams. It’s the music, however, that sustains Lemonade’s influence. The latest chapter in Beyoncé’s   plan to conquer all genres while remaining unstintingly loyal to   and soul, this album shows Beyoncé dispatching hard rock, country (with a Mardi Gras Indian assault!) indie art snobbery and wimpy SoundCloud RB, even as her   heels remain planted in the   style she essentially invented. She’s done so much here, all in service to   women’s stories. The blues stream that extends from Lemonade’s central storyline about marital betrayal and forgiveness opens up into so many tributaries (concerning paternal inheritance, maternal fortitude, cultural and real reparations, economies built on women’s labor, artistic lineages grounded in women’s fun) that to say these songs are ”personal” is to miss the point. Yet, as the joy of recognition this album inspired makes clear, Beyoncé’s version of the ”personal” has always been communal, from her highly collaborative artistic process to the way that even her most private stories offer themselves to others as testaments. Lemonade is her liberation theology.  —  Ann Powers, Listen: Tidal, Big Thief is muscular and frail. Its songs revolve around singer and guitarist Adrianne Lenker and her musical partner, guitarist Buck Meek. They’re storytellers as much as song makers and their distorted   music is a powerful underpinning to vivid and stark imagery: ”I’ll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine. I’ll be your record player baby if you know what I mean. I’ll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath. I’ll be a killer and a thriller and the cause of our death” Masterpiece is one of the strongest debut albums of 2016. It’s an album on being human, finding compassion, being a lover or just a friend. ”Cry like a bird, fly like a babyMama got drunk and daddy went crazy. If your speech slurs, if you feel shakymeet me out back, I’ll be there waiting.” Masterpiece shakes off the trite relationship cliches that are trappings of so much rock music. It’s a special world they’ve created and it lives in my head on repeat.  —  Bob Boilen, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp, Albums are rarely this ambitious or executed this brilliantly. Before its release, Car Seat Headrest frontman Will Toledo had already proven to be a gifted and ridiculously prolific songwriter, putting out nearly a dozen inspired albums in the span of five years. But Teens Of Denial is his masterpiece. Epic in its vision and execution, each track mumbles and roars with life, building monumental guitar noise and intricate,   wordplay before receding again to more ruminative shadows. It sounds at times like the ramblings of a mad genius as a song suddenly (and repeatedly) careens in multiple directions depending on whatever thought or observation or labyrinthine melody pops into Toledo’s head. Teens Of Denial is the kind of album future   will obsess about.  —  Robin Hilton, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, Carrie Rodriguez has recorded the pefect bicultural album in Lola. It is the album she was born to do, what with her mother’s west Texas roots and her father’s Mexican American background, but she arrived at this point by collecting her own identity along the way: first classical violin, then Americana fiddle and country vocal duets with Chip Taylor. The beauty of this album is in the details. ”Llano Estacado” is an emotional examination of the effects of a broken immigration policy set to what she calls a ”cowboy shuffle” that she delivers by she switching between Spanish and English accented by her beautiful west Texas drawl. I don’t think I have ever heard anything express so powerfully the kind of bicultural existence so many of us live.  —  Felix Contreras, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, A songwriter’s songwriter with a trembling, tearful larynx, Corinne Bailey Rae gifted us in 2010 with The Sea, a heartrending sophomore turn in the aftermath of the untimely death of her husband Jason, but followed it with meandering misstep The Love EP. The Heart Speaks in Whispers  —   her third album and first   studio effort in six years  —   soars ebulliently on recharged emotionalism and the surging promise of ”up jumped spring” new love. What a   group of collaborators, including the likes of Moses Sumney, Esperanza Spalding and RB trio KING: They show up to magically lift tunes like the     ”The Skies Will Break,” sunkissed ”Hey, I Won’t Break Your Heart,”    ”Been to the Moon” and   intoxicating ”Green Aphrodiasic.” Black women sporting guitars and writing their own tunes, from Rosetta Tharpe to Joan Armatrading to Lianne La Havas, have always received the shortest end of the stick: Bailey Rae almost surely might be playing larger venues if she was white   a man making music this mellifluous,   and artistically confident. But just as the heart speaks in whispers, sometimes music’s   secrets deliver when they operate under the radar, too.  —  Jason King, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, I listened to Bowie’s astonishing 25th studio album Blackstar on the Friday in January it was released, which also happened to be his 69th birthday. I spent that weekend working through the album’s somber horns and   experimentalism, the mystical, indecipherable allusions on tunes like ”’Tis a Pity She’s a Whore” and those multipart, Tony   arrangements such as the   challenging title track. Two days later, Bowie suddenly died and we were all were forced to     the album’s most curious, WTF lyrical moments like, ”Look up here, I’m in heaven” (on ”Lazarus”) and ”Where the f*** did Monday go?” (on ”Girl Loves Me”).   eccentric songs like ”I Can’t Give Everything Away” as existential commentary turned Blackstar into more than the final bit of punctuation on Bowie’s   career  —   made a   rock album a melancholic rumination on death, on identity boundaries, on stardom, on the universe and astrology, on love, religion and on the limits of the pop machine. Blackstar also happens to be a richly musical offering, more sonically generous and full of   ideas than one might ever expect to hear from any terminally ill musician. As much or more than Kanye’s Life of Pablo, Blackstar is the 2016 album that refuses closure: It becomes something new every time you deeply listen. It’s the most powerful parting gift David Bowie could have ever given us. What did we do to deserve such a creative genius in our lifetimes?  —  Jason King, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Amazon   Tidal, It was pretty obvious early on that Odd Future’s Domo Genesis could     not only his affiliates, but also more than a handful of the prominent rappers out when he first popped in 2010. Six years later and he’s mastered the art of   on his   and painstakingly created debut album, aptly titled Genesis. It’s a peek into the crossed wires of Domo’s mind, where he thrives on different forms of confidence. He flosses alongside the greatest regenerating rapper of our time, Juicy J, and the affable and omnipresent Wiz Khalifa over Tyler the Creator’s Kill   ”Go (Gas).” He flexes alongside Anderson . Paak on the   ”Dapper.” He also takes ample time to acknowledge the causes (and effects) of the growth he’s shown over the years, using tracks like the bare open ”One Below” to rightfully attribute much of his development to his own patience  —   and his mother’s. With nary a glimmer of uncertainty in sight, Genesis is what it sounds like to truly find, trust and believe in oneself.  —  Kiana Fitzgerald, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, Esperanza Spalding’s talents are obvious on stage: her exceptional bass playing, her conceptual imagination, her tendency toward the compositionally ornate, her   command of her vocal instrument. That jigsaw hasn’t always fully assembled for her records, which seem to summon an editor for concision, or something to scuff up the sheen, or some better translation of the   to the  . Surprise: This record is her best yet. Forced to classify, you’d call it art rock, for    electric power trio asked for touchstones, you might throw out St. Vincent, or Laurie Anderson, or Janelle Monae. There are   vibes throughout, with unexpected harmonic twists, asymmetric phrasing,   beats, an alter ego or persona (the titular Emily) even a choreographed stage show. But the trick of Emily’s D+Evolution is that ”that’s kinda weird” becomes ”that’s really catchy” on repeated listen. There’s a depth here that wouldn’t be possible without a broad musical vocabulary (and Matthew Stevens’ guitar). But for all the inputs, what emerges is eminently singable, kinks and all.  —  Patrick Jarenwattananon, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, You could enjoy this record without knowing any of the tunes, or the players, or their history. You’d get spacious slow numbers that eventually reveal georgeous melodies. You’d get the energy turned up, sometimes with raw abstraction, other times with a dark funk groove. You’d get a drummer who doubles on piano, an electric bassist who doubles on atmospheric electronics, a tenor saxophonist who doubles on other saxes. Texturally and intellectually, it’d be a little bit elusive and mysterious, a lot of coloring outside the beat. But you can add meaning knowing that Ravi Coltrane (saxes) and Matthew Garrison (bass) are the sons of John Coltrane (saxes) and Jimmy Garrison (bass) and that drummer Jack DeJohnette has known them since they were kids because he played with John Coltrane and Jimmy Garrison. Some of these tunes salute DeJohnette’s heroes like Jimi Hendrix (”Two Jimmys”) Maurice White of Earth, Wind and Fire (”Serpentine Fire”) and bandmate Rashied Ali (”Rashied”) others were famously performed by John Coltrane (”Alabama,” ”Blue In Green”). The roots run deep, and you can read whatever interpretive intentions you wish from that. Or you could just enjoy the music.  —  Patrick Jarenwattananon, Cynicism has predisposed us to assume that when legendary musical figures, a few years beyond their best work, come together for one more project, they’re doomed to stylish mediocrity. Well, Transport trumps cynicism. The second album by Borderland, the recent union of Detroit techno’s godfather and the primary architect of Berlin’s techno sound, is a wonder, out of place and out of time. It is seven tracks of     funk that is expertly textured (with von Oswald, that’s a given) but also incredibly playful and nuanced in its rhythms, an exploration of the contemporary electronic groove that has little in common with the   chaos of most modern dance music. (Though, as ”Lightyears” can attest, it isn’t too precious to pack a   wallop.) Transport is the best example yet of techno aging gracefully  —   and what could be less cynical than that?  —  Piotr Orlov, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, For all the talk about the eternally   nature of The Life of Pablo (and its ongoing saga of various titles and tracklists and covers and formats and late addendums) Kanye was the one who this year showed he best understands what an album is nowadays. He is transparently pragmatic when it comes to the ways an LP  —   this weighty serious thing made by people who transcend radio, who are the real deal, and which also acts as a key for certain doors, much like publishing a book, any book at all, confers legitimacy, at least for a little while longer  —   can be used to leverage influence and attention into sales of other products with better margins. He’s also a   romantic, who reads the historical moment and wrings from it   disconcertingly ambivalent songs, most of which grow on you, though lately their seams never disappear, and all of which boil over from a named group of feelings and a specific experience, each helping decode the others. Although he’s remained on message for over a decade, you can’t swap a song from one Kanye album onto another. This time he’s become ever more relatable, as one consumer to another, ratifying with his masterful   (also called making art) what it’s like to have a voracious, indiscrimate cultural appetite, to speak in a vernacular that has become hyper visual, broadly referential and dependent on gossip. TLOP feels transitional and unreliable so did all the other mess that happened in the past six months. It wouldn’t have made sense last year and we’d dismiss it if we heard it for the first time tomorrow. It’s   tougher than it looks, and prescient.  —  Frannie Kelley, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, I discovered 99. 9% on a mellow, rainy Sunday afternoon this spring. I put the album on after reading an emotional and honest profile on the    . I immediately had one of those, ”whoa, what the heck did I just listen to?” moments and had to sit down to process (after, um, dancing alone in my living room). It’s hard not to notice that Kay loves spiky   funky soul,   disco,     and a welcome flourish of bumpin’ Chicago House, but what makes this debut album so noteworthy is that he  —   like his innovative brethren Anderson. Paak and Syd The Kid, who both show up as guests  —   is challenging what it is to be making modern, youthful Black music. Energetic, pensive, yet   Kaytranada has created one of the most beautiful, solid albums of the year.  —  Saidah Blount, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, Music critics tend to be drawn to country acts they see as rebelling against a cautious music industry  —   except in the case of Maren Morris. Hero, the      singer and songwriter’s   national debut, is the fruit of her savvily gaming the system, stockpiling burnished   tracks that anticipated mainstream country’s next shift and spurred swift movement from a major label. First single ”My Church” delivered an addictive hook with thoroughly breezy bite, and that tone of voice, coloring both her writing and her vocal delivery, serves as an appealing   on her album. She’s funny when she rolls her eyes at a   beau in ”Rich” and a pushover friend in ”Drunk Girls Don’t Cry” and frank about being resistant to romance in the     ”I Wish I Was” and the airily rueful ballad ”I Could Use a Love Song.” Morris is an astute student of current popcraft, at ease with the cadences and postures of RB and   as casually chameleonic as any country artist to date. And beneath the artful slouch of her singing is a powerhouse voice and a compelling perspective.  —  Jewly Hight, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Amazon   Tidal, In 1921, the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a sonnet about a cigarette the old form proved ideal for capturing the ambiguities of a changing modern world. In 2016, Margo Price made a   album about trying to survive in the world of country music now, as gentrification makes life for artists tough, and the classic sounds she loves  —   not just hard country, but Southern soul and 1960s pop balladry  —   have been pushed off the radio by   guitars and   beats. Midwest Farmer’s Daughter never sounds like a museum piece, because its tales of hard drinking, sad loving and outlaw behavior are all as true as they are carefully crafted to honor the traditions Price means to extend. As a songwriter, Price is disarmingly honest, owning her bad luck, her mistakes and the courage she cultivated to overcome them. The crucial element, holding together the brilliant band of young Nashville cats she’s assembled, is her voice  —   sumptuous and raw, strong as burlap and sweet as cornsilk, wild and blue.  —  Ann Powers, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, I don’t know how to write about Mitski, not the way I know how to write about rap musicians and rap songs. I don’t know who her peers and predecessors are. I don’t know her lexicon. I have no way of knowing if she’s making allusions, or teasing somebody, or paying her respects. I assume that much is flying right past me. I’ll tell you what though, I recognize these songs. On Puberty 2, Mitski is voicing a person trapped in the detritus and insinuating perpetuations of misogyny (buttressed by racism and homophobia) reasonably disaffected, lied to, painfully aware, casually exploited, implacably refusing to be victimized by all that (”When I find that a knife’s sticking out of my side, I’ll pull it out without questioning why,” she sings on ”Fireworks”) and nonetheless creative. When I listen to her songs back to back with contemporary rap songs I traverse related emotional terrain. She’s verbose, rhythmically astute but cavalier with meter, switching her flow as needed. Her songs are polished and lived in, funny and economical and graceful. ”I want to see the whole world,” she says on ”My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars.” ”I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent.” Puberty 2 is accurate, perilously close to home, like it might make you cry in public. And then you’ll feel better.  —  Frannie Kelley, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, Christopher Rouse can make even a modestly sized orchestra roar, shriek and nearly explode  —   he is, after all, a composer who wrote a piece about thunderous Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. This album, a testament to the vital partnership of the New York Philharmonic and outgoing music director Alan Gilbert, has plenty of that energy and murky subterranean rumblings, but it also glows while spinning out a series of gentle melodies and enigmatic ideas. It is a collection of more tributes: The overture Prospero’s Rooms is a sketch of fellow Baltimorean Edgar Allan Poe’s ”Masque of the Red Death.” The radiant Odna Zhizn (A Life) pays homage to an unnamed Russian woman very close to Rouse. The Third Symphony is based on the architecture and force of Prokofiev’s little known Second Symphony. And the meaning of the Fourth Symphony, skittering then extremely bleak, is known to Rouse alone.  —  Mark Mobley, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, The   beat tape is no longer the trendy commodity it once was. Most   producers won’t release their bare instrumentals, fearing unwanted exposure, unless those beats are proven hits. Oddisee has never been afraid. In May, he released The Odd Tape, the best instrumental album of his career. These projects have always incorporated storytelling, channeling feelings of the seasons or expressing personal struggle through beats. The Odd Tape is a day in the life of Oddisee. The   excursion wakes you with the opening dings of ”Alarmed” and gently soothes with the closing lullaby, ”Still Sleeping.” The pride of P. G. County’s sound has blossomed from once flipping beats built around samples to now making the sample sound as if it was catered to the live instrumentation. Fortune still favors the brave.  —  Bobby Carter, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, I think of Paul Simon as our greatest living songwriter. His songs are portraits, thoughtful snapshots on the human condition and, more often than not, on Americans and American culture. His consistency as an artist is unparalleled, going back fifty solid years to those early Simon and Garfunkel records. From its opening track, his masterful 2016 album Stranger to Stranger explores our fears as a culture  —   of the future, of the unknown. Every instrument, every sound effect, every vocal is finely detailed and crafted to serve the song. And those songs are more often created not from the usual three chord acoustic guitar repertoire but from the feet of flamenco dancers and electronic beats, then sculpted and changed and polished beyond recognition into these memorable musical jewels, each one shining so clearly.  —  Bob Boilen, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, A Moon Shaped Pool doesn’t have the brooding guitar noise of Radiohead’s earlier records, or the vast conceptual scope and studio alchemy of the band’s more recent work. What it does have is a tremendous amount of heartache, informed, in part, by the end of singer Thom Yorke’s   relationship with the artist Rachel Owen. But A Moon Shaped Pool isn’t a breakup album. It’s more of a reflection on where the band finds itself after reaching middle age with 30 years of making music behind it. The songs are more restrained, more introspective and certainly among the most beautiful and deeply affecting of anything the band has ever done. A Moon Shaped Pool feels like the right album at the right time for this band and will likely, in time, be considered one of Radiohead’s masterworks.  —  Robin Hilton, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, A master of disguise, Rihanna has been maneuvering within the ”urban” market since her debut, but is somehow always able to morph styles from record to record in ways that magnify her appeal without alienating audiences. (Receipts: See her positions near the top of a handful of Billboard’s   charts, plus her dedicated Internet coalition, The Navy.) This year’s ANTI feels like the first time the entertainer has opted out of   and instead focused on creating a full body of   work that doesn’t necessarily belong in either the urban or the pop charts. She clasps her identity tight immediately with the opening track, ”Consideration,” alongside Top Dawg Entertainment’s SZA, stalks through the damaging   and Travi$   ”Woo” and slithers through the Tame Impala cover ”Same Ol’ Mistakes,” which stands out dreamily from the rest of album like northern lights. Meanwhile, the bonus tracks (shouts to ”Sex With Me” and ”Pose,” in particular) cushion her aura, bringing her irresistible and iridescent nature full circle.  —  Kiana Fitzgerald, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, Robert Ellis’ fourth solo effort is a road album and a breakup album, summed up no better than Ellis himself does on ”Elephant,” a quiet and desperate song that nonetheless sparkles with a Texas twang: ”Oh, my heart   It’s torn in two   one half’s on the road and other remains with you.” Where previous records played with Ellis’ country and Americana roots, here he’s more wont to apply a thoughtful songwriter’s touch to his musical whims. Just as he can pick an acoustic guitar with the best of them (especially with   man Kelly Doyle on the   ”Drivin’”) Ellis bares his soul with dramatic soul and pop music deftly (and sometimes lushly and outrageously) arranged to pick apart his guilt, jealousy and hurt. Heartbreak shouldn’t be this fun or uplifting, but maybe, as Ellis sings, it’s ”just survivin’.”  —  Lars Gotrich, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, From the start, this album can seem an exercise in trampling your expectations. Rather than the edgy   Sturgill Simpson honed on Metamodern Sounds In Country Music, the first taste of A Sailor’s Guide To Earth is a gruffly sweet greeting for Simpson’s young son, all the awe of a new parent orchestrated in strings and steel guitar. But three minutes in  —   perhaps you’ve adjusted by now  —   well, The   kick in, Simpson’s   baritone rises to a soulful shout and you realize that maybe the sly nod to Otis Redding’s ”Dock Of The Bay” in the track’s first few seconds wasn’t mere coincidence. Playing neatly into Simpson’s reputation for contrarianism is the fact that, as everyone else in Nashville clamored to work with his collaborator Dave Cobb, Simpson chose to   this record, which notably features a Nirvana cover lodged amid his own wry,   writing. Yet for all its defiance, A Sailor’s Guide has at its core something more vulnerable. Simpson knows from experience that navigating life is tricky, and that even the best charts can’t guarantee a ship will avoid every squall. But at the album’s emotional peak, the gorgeous soul ballad ”All Around You,” his message to his son is clear: Love will be there, even when all seems lost. In its earnest optimism, that itself is a subversive notion.  —  Rachel Horn, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Amazon   Tidal, Metal can’t help but look back, its DNA nearing five decades of riffs and wails. We celebrate the keepers of the faith, but some still crave evolution. Vektor, a band that’s long owed its existence to   icons like Voivod and Death, stepped out of its breakneck thrash ’n’ death to make the most gripping metal album of the year so far. True to the band’s   themes, Terminal Redux is a story about an astronaut’s rise to power after discovering a   molecule. The album still has goofy moments of party thrash, but mostly Vektor fearlessly pushes itself into new realms with Philly soul singers,     vast arrangements that imagine Messiaen shredding the cosmos and, it should go without saying, David DiSanto and Erik Nelson’s continuously surprising guitar interplay. Terminal Redux is a dazzling feat of insane musicianship and extended compositions that thrill, but is ultimately a record with real heart, of discovering purpose and struggling with legacy.  —  Lars Gotrich, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, ”I want it all now,” Xenia Rubinos sings on ”Mexican Chef,” her   of a tirade against a service industry that relies upon the skills of   laborers but requires that they stay behind closed kitchen doors. It’s a    —   you can hear her fury in the clattering drums, the getaway guitars, the breathless pileup of injustices in the lyrics  —   but it’s also a celebration of those overlooked workers. That’s typical of Black Terry Cat, which demands plenty, but offers generously in return. At times, especially as the more frantic moments of ”See Them” and ”Black Stars,” give way to a groove, the songs here recall the musical omnivorousness of   or the     sophistication of Erykah Badu’s New Amerykah diptych. Even on the lushly minimalist ”Don’t Wanna Be” or ”Lonely Lover,” Rubinos takes too many left turns, fuses too many styles, jumps from haunted heartache to soft seduction too fast for a listener to absorb the full effect in a single listen. But then every song on Black Terry Cat also has a gorgeous melody, a   synth line, an irresistible rhythmic hook that sinks in immediately and nudges your fingers toward the repeat button. Give her what she asks for. Sooner or later she’s gonna get it anyway.  —  Jacob Ganz, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Bandcamp   Tidal, There are many folks who say you should never tamper with greatness, that you cannot improve on that which starts out as completely original. On the whole, I’d agree, so when the people who own the Fania Records catalog announced they were recruiting dance club DJs and producers to take on the definitive classic 1970’s salsa, I raised one eyebrow in complete skepticism. But when I heard the finished product my other eyebrow shot up in disbelief that the ideas and production not only held its own but it actually moved Latin dance music further along its musical evolution. This album features talents who can take apart the core elements of, say, a Cuban guaguanco and marry it to the power that drives people onto the dance floor. Anything that can do that recognizes that what these styles share is more important than their differences.  —  Felix Contreras, Listen: Spotify   Apple   Tidal, American author and composer Paul Bowles deeply loved Morocco. He was first smitten after a 1931 visit with Aaron Copland. In 1947, he moved there and stayed until his death 1999. He also adored the country’s incredibly varied music, from the   orchestras to the deeply earthy music of the Gnawa community, whose traditions and rhythms fuse the Maghreb firmly to the  . And in 1959, Bowles crammed a    tape recorder into his Beetle and set off to record musicians across Morocco for the Library of Congress in a   sprint. (Bowles wasn’t above crafting his own vision of these field recordings.) Now those recordings have been made available  —   about half of them for the first time  —   in an absolutely gorgeous   set, elaborately outfitted with Bowles’ field notes and extensive liner notes. This set is a portrait of Bowles’ tastes as much as it is a collection of sonic snapshots in newly independent Morocco either way, it’s a treasure.  —  Anastasia Tsioulcas, Listen: Bandcamp"
"House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke with NPR’s Steve Inskeep. Steve Inskeep: We’re sitting down in the middle of a year in which a lot of people, particularly those involved in politics, have expressed distress, have said that they don’t know their party anymore, don’t know their country anymore. And so I’d like to know: What if anything have you learned about the country from the presidential campaign and the events of this year that you didn’t know? Paul Ryan: I’ve learned the country is very distressed. I took this job Oct. 29 before the presidential election got started and worked to get our party in the House to agree that we would assemble an agenda to tackle the big problems facing the country, and take it to the country. And the primary process got underway. Seventeen people  —   it was a big field, a lot of good, quality folks ran. And what I watched in our party was a lot of anxiety. A lot of people really distressed about the direction of the country. I then watched the same thing basically happen on the Democrat side of the aisle, which is a very competitive primary  —   far more competitive than I thought people were expecting. And so, I think we have a country that is kind of  . We’ve had flat wages, anemic economic growth. We’ve got international problems, terrorism, you name it. So people are very anxious. Economically, poverty is very stubborn in that it’s been stubbornly high. So what we’re trying to do is be a port in the storm. The way I describe it to our colleagues is the ship of state is kind of floating all over the place right now. And our job is, we ought to see it and add a keel and a rudder to it to give it some direction. Were you surprised by extent of the anxiety? Was I surprised by what? The extent of the anxiety. Not really, only because I experience it myself. If you’re a House member, you’re very close to your constituents. You’re very close to the voters. You’re up for election every other year, so you’re always out and about in your community. And because of the role I have, I’m around the country a lot. And I meet with people from all backgrounds and walks of life, and I spent the last four years touring poor communities with my friend [community organizer] Bob Woodson. Learning, listening, not with TV cameras or media. So, it was pretty clear to me that people were pretty, pretty hurting in this country and pretty anxious. So no, I wasn’t surprised. It just  —   it just became [that] the volume and the noise level got much higher. Why is it important for you that the Republican Party make a mark on poverty? You talked about traveling to understand the problem better it’s part of your agenda that you put out. It is a part of our agenda because I think it’s who we are and I think we have better ideas. The way I’ve always looked at these jobs as being problem solvers. And to me  —   I was influenced by certain people and mentors. [Late Republican lawmaker] Jack Kemp was my greatest mentor who I used to work with, and he spent a lot of his time on this issue. So at a young age I became very interested in the issue of poverty and in the issue of outreach. And so what I basically saw after doing a deep dive into just sort of the statistics of poverty and into the economics of poverty and into the policies we have, I then wanted to learn more about it on a personal level. So I asked my friend Bob Woodson, who’s a poverty fighter of many, many decades, to show me poverty in America and let me, you know, teach me. So I spent a number of years doing that and I was  —   I loved it. I loved it in the way that I felt like there are really good answers to be had out here. And I felt like there was a great opportunity for our principles to be applied here to make a huge difference. And so the reason I think we ought to focus on poverty is because it’s been a problem that’s been stubborn and that we haven’t fixed it. We’ve had a big effort. We’ve had a war on poverty. Trillions of dollars spent. Dozens and dozens of programs created. Yet we’ve kind of barely moved the needle. Some things that we’ve done . .. I’ve liked the earned income tax credit. I think there are things that have worked well, but so many things we have done that sort of backfired on us. So I see a problem that can be fixed. But I also see a problem where a lot of people don’t believe in the American idea anymore. The condition of your birth doesn’t determine the outcome of your life. This is America, you can make it. You work hard, play by the rules, you can rise, you can do well. That’s what we’re taught, that’s what we believe, that’s what we think of as America. Problem is, there are just generations of people in this country who do not think that. Do some of the statistics that you quote, like the fact that very few people can get out of poverty if they’re born into poverty, show that it’s actually not the country we believed it was? No, I think that’s right. So we think of the ideal and we think that that is what the country is, and then you actually go look at the country and the conditions. You’re just as more likely to stay poor today as you were if you were born into poverty 50 years ago. And so we have not made the kind of mark we need to make. And so let’s go back and figure out how we can get our country to reach its ideal because it is not there right now. And so, yeah, I think that that’s something a lot of people have to learn. And what I look at is I see problems that can be fixed because I see solutions that are actually occurring. That’s what’s exciting about this issue . .. because there are people in communities who are actually out there fighting poverty eye to eye, soul to soul, in neighborhoods that actually do well, that succeed. But for government, I think in many cases they can do more. And so what I want to do is make sure that in these communities we actually empower these groups, we empower these people. We take their lessons and we reapply them throughout the rest of the country. [The]   zone in Milwaukee is now been applied in Racine, Wis. which is . .. having mentors from former gang members. People who had hard knocks in life got rehabilitated going into schools. They have credibility and they’re helping young people avoid the mistakes that they made. And we’re seeing a huge decline in violence, a big increase in academic performance, and we’re seeing, you know, families kind of put back together because of a homegrown idea, which started in Dallas and then got replicated in Milwaukee and now we’re bringing it to Racine. And it’s just something that people did organically locally. And local government, local people, local churches and community groups came together to put this to work. That’s a good example of something that I think is just very interesting and exciting and inspiring that we want to replicate. Mr. Speaker, you say something a lot of Republicans have said over the years, that some Democrats have said over the years. You’ve argued that welfare is keeping people away from work  —   it disincentivizes work, as you will. One answer in the past has been simply to cut welfare. Is that what you want to do? No, I think the smarter thing to do is to customize the benefits to a person’s particular needs. And that’s what I learned again by traveling the country. Looking at different models that work. I’m a Catholic, full disclosure  —   the Catholic charities model. They do it in Fort Worth [Texas] really well. What you do is you customize a benefit to a person’s particular needs so that you can make sure she has what she needs. Maybe this woman needs addiction counseling, or maybe she needs a GED, or transportation or something. You customize the benefits for her particular needs with the proper accountability: work requirements, time limits or, if she can’t get a job and needs education, education. Instead of having these hard cliffs. So, as you describe it, just cutting off welfare  —   you know, it’s sort of the cold love cutting off cliffs without actually getting a person on a path doesn’t work. But tapering these benefits so that work always pays, it always makes sense to take the next step forward is the way to go. And the only way you can really do that right is to customize a benefit to a person’s particular needs. So, if they get a job, they don’t end up making less than they would on welfare . .. That’s right. So you always want it to pay. So you don’t want to have what we call the poverty trap where if you take a job and you lose 80 cents on the dollar in benefits and you can’t see your kids, you’re not going to take that job. So you can’t make it an   cliff. You can’t make it an 80 percent tax rate to go to work. You have to actually taper these benefits and do it in such a way that it always makes sense to take the next step forward. And the only way you can do that is not micromanage in Washington it is to actually customize benefits. And the way I look at this is: Let’s break up the welfare monopoly, instead of having just the welfare agency at the county level give people their benefits, which they basically  . . .. They don’t actually treat the person. Let other providers also provide these   wraparound benefits. Let the Catholic Church do it. Let Lutheran social services. Let America Works, a   agency that’s good at this. So, have a competition based on evidence, based on outcome, providing these benefits that are customized to people to get them out of poverty and on their way to success. When we’ve done voter interviews we find a lot of people who are working, and they’re making $10 an hour. They’re making a couple dollars an hour as a waitress plus tips. Right. Why not do something that raises wages? Well, skills. So actually, I think, when you raise the minimum wage, we already showed  —   [Congressional Budget Office] tells us you’ll lose over a million jobs in certain proposals. So you don’t want to take away those   jobs that get people the hard and soft skills they need just to learn how to do work. What you need to do is amplify their ability to get a better job by education, by skills training. Maybe it’s technical college. Maybe it’s a GED. That is where I think these benefits and the customization of benefits comes into play. Every person has a different problem. Sometimes a person has an even deeper problem, like an addiction or something like that. So that’s why I think it’s important to not have some sort of     program in Washington, which has downsides, like killing   jobs. But pulling people into the workforce  —   I think a smarter idea than a minimum wage increase is earned income tax credit. I think we should apply it to childless adults . .. Paying people who are working  —   they get a tax credit, a straight tax payment is what you’re saying. Yeah, but I think it should be every month. It should be in the paycheck. Right now, the EITC, good idea, it’s Milton Friedman’s old idea actually . .. The economist. It’s a lump sum at the end of the year, and so you don’t sort of feel the effects of making work pay. I think we should make it a monthly or whenever your paycheck occurs, and you can do this to the Social Security system. And I think we should apply it to childless adults because that’s one of the stubborn problems we have. You look at labor force participation rates, young childless adults 18 to 34 are the people who are really slipping through the cracks in this country and they’re running into these cliffs. And so that’s one of the things I think we could do to improve that. Can your own party deliver the votes for something like that? I’ve talked with people in your own party who are outraged by the earned income tax credit, it’s just a straight payment to people. I think they’re outraged at the fraud rate, which is a problem. It’s $24 billion a year. That . .. means there are mispayments, overpayments, payments to people that don’t qualify or aren’t eligible but still nevertheless get it. That’s why I think you need to do it monthly. I think there are ways of cleaning up the fraud, making it work better and basically making it more of something that people see it makes work pay on a paycheck basis, not on an annual basis. So yes, I think our party can embrace this. I’m the leader of my party and I’m actually one of the people proposing this. But I think ultimately these things need to be bipartisan. Ultimately I think these ought to be bipartisan. And the people we partner with in local communities typically are Democrats. You just passed a bipartisan bill to deal with opioid addiction. It’s a problem that lots of people are concerned about. I have one question about it, though. This bill focuses on treatment, not on criminal punishment. Yeah. Some people have raised questions about that, about whether there’s been a double standard over time. In the ’80s when there was a focus on drugs in the black community, people focused on prisons. Now people are concerned in the white community, and it’s about treatment and public health. What’s happening there? No, I think you need to complement this with criminal justice reform. I agree with that, as well. That’s something we’re working on for September. We’ve got four bills on criminal justice reform already out of the Judiciary Committee. We’re looking at getting two more out. Just this week I set up a working group of members from both sides of the aisle to work on community policing ideas, training ideas, but also finishing the job on criminal justice reform so we can get all of those bills out to the floor in September. So, opioid abuse is an epidemic in America. This was a fantastic effort of Republicans and Democrats coming together to solve this problem which, as you say, it’s about treatment, it’s about intervention, it’s about recovery. In the 1990s, to your first point, I think government, both Republicans and Democrats, overcompensated on our criminal code. And we went too far and there are disparities  —   crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine  —   there are clear disparities and more importantly, I think that we’ve learned there are better ways of dealing with some of these problems than locking up somebody for 20 or 30 years. You end up ruining their lives, ruining their families, hurting communities, and then when they try to   into society, they’re destitute. So I really think there are better methods of dealing with these problems, and I think that is part of criminal justice reform. I think that’s something I put out in the poverty plan that I first authored three years ago. So we intend on bringing these bills up in September. Some people will know that you support broadly free trade and trade agreements. Donald Trump, your party’s presidential candidate, broadly speaking has criticized them. You clearly believe that free trade is better for economic growth. If Mr. Trump is elected, if his policies lead to trade wars, will there be more people in poverty? Well, yeah, I don’t think big tariff  —   I’ve been pretty clear about this  —   I think massive    tariff increases basically just raise the prices on consumers, start trade wars. I think the smart way is to border adjust our taxes, like we’re proposing to do with ”Our Better Way” tax reform. I also think it’s important that if we’re going to lead in the global economy and the 21st century then we have to get the rest of the world to play by our rules in the 21st century global economy. And the only way to do that is to get good trade agreements. I’ve spoken to Donald about this. He says he wants good trade agreements. Well, so do I. I don’t want bad trade agreements, I want good trade agreements. And so the proof is in the pudding. And we have . .. I’m not sure if that means that you agree necessarily on this issue. I don’t know if it agrees, but the fact that he says he wants trade agreements  —   just good ones  —   I think tells me that he’s not against getting trade agreements. It’s just the quality of the trade agreements he wants to get. And that’s fantastic. I want to go get trade agreements, because if America walls itself up, if we address sort of an economic fortress America, we will lose. Look, it’s pretty easy to see why.   percent of the world’s population does not live in this country. We are a mature economy. If we want to have good jobs and faster wage growth, we have to make more things in America and sell them overseas, because 96 percent of the world’s consumers are not in our country. And, oh by the way, all these other countries are going around the world and getting preferential trade agreements among themselves, leaving us on the outside looking in. So that is a problem. If we stand still on trade and do nothing, then Europe, China, and the rest will go around the world and get better trade agreements and freeze us out of those markets that we’re already in today. Let me give you an example: I come from Wisconsin. We pride ourselves on making and selling cheese. Europe is going around the world getting the rest of the world to agree to Europe’s cheese regulations, we call it geographic indicators. Europe is saying you can’t buy Swiss cheese or feta cheese or Parmesan cheese or Gouda if it doesn’t come from those specific areas in Europe  —   meaning the Wisconsin Swiss, Parmesan, and feta and Gouda we make, they’re getting trade agreements that would freeze us out of those markets. That’s ridiculous. And so we have to go around the world and fight to make sure that these rules are clear and fair so that American   in Wisconsin can still have markets. Because I love to say that we eat a lot of cheese in America, but we can’t possibly consume all the cheese we make in Wisconsin. Just an example. But you’re in a situation where Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, Bernie Sanders opposes [the North American Free Trade Agreement] and the   Partnership, Hillary Clinton . .. Hillary Clinton opposes these things, yeah. Well, that’s what I’m asking. Have you lost the country on this one? I think we’re in tough economic times and high anxiety and I think this is an issue that is always very difficult to sell when we have slow economic growth and flat wages. I think we get faster economic growth, faster wage growth, and we have to prove that opening up markets and getting good agreements for our country, for our manufacturers, will help get better jobs. We have more work to do, but it’s really hard to talk about the benefits of opening up trade with other countries when we have a tough economy. And that’s the situation we find ourselves in today. Is it remotely possible that you would approve the   Partnership, which Congress would need to do before there’s a new president that says they’re opposed to it. Well, I don’t know the answer to that question. I really just don’t, because I think the president has to go back and renegotiate some key provisions in it. The provisions as they are drafted now I don’t think are ready to go. So he has to go back and fix a number of the things that are in this agreement before it can be ready to be considered. When Republicans who have endorsed Donald Trump are asked about Trump, it’s common for them to say, well, whatever reservations I may have he’d be a better president than Hillary Clinton. You’ve said that. So let’s take that as a given, that point of view. But let me take Hillary Clinton out of the equation for a moment: Standing on his own, would Donald Trump be a good president of the United States? That’s not the question we have in front of us. We have a binary choice. It is either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. So what’s the point of entertaining hypotheticals that do not exist. That’s not the question we’re facing. We’re facing . .. Well, it’s not a hypothetical. He could be elected. Would he be a good president? We’re facing Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. And I do believe that Donald Trump would be a far better president than Hillary Clinton. I think Donald Trump will pick better Supreme Court justices. I think Donald Trump will sign better legislation into law that gets our country on a better path than Hillary Clinton. That’s the choice in front of us and that is why I’m supporting Donald Trump. What does he need to change to be a good president? Well, you know he and I have talked about this. I think  —   I just think improving temperament and inclusive rhetoric, and an agenda that invites people into our party is something that I think anybody going from a primary to a general election needs a transition. I find what happens is both parties speak to their party bases to win their primary elections, but what I think is necessary to have a national election worthy of being a majority party, we have to sell converts to conservatism. We have to go out and explain why our principles apply equally and universally to everybody and why our ideas are better than the alternatives. This is basically, Steve, by the way, why we have a Better Way agenda. This is why you go to better. gop and you can see the things that we’re talking about to improve this country. To grow the economy. To make us more secure. To restore  . To have   health care. To fix our debt problem. These are the ideas that I think we need to go talk to the country about and we need to do it in a way that people who are not used to voting for us or who have never voted for us are inclined to do so. So, I think better outreach that’s more inclusive, I think that would be something that would be an improvement. You said the word inclusive. I spoke with a thoughtful conservative before coming here  —   someone who likes you very much and who says he believes that you really do care about poverty, you really do care about being inclusive and broadening the Republican Party. And then goes on to say, if you attach yourself to Donald Trump, you sink all that. Yeah, I don’t see that. I don’t  —   I’m the   Republican in the country I’m the speaker of the House. I have certain duties and responsibilities that come with this office and one of the primary political duties with this job is not to   our party and cut it in half and therefore guarantee that the left wins by default. Do you have any assurances from Mr. Trump about his behavior or anything that has concerned you? Look, you know I’ve had disagreements with him. I’ve made those  —   those are fairly publicly known. And he and I have had those same conversations. He knows how I feel about these things. But do you think he’s changing anything? I believe he’s going to endeavor, to try. Let me ask you about something else that gets to being inclusive and to the diversity of the country. You spoke in the House of Representatives after the shootings in the past week  —   very interesting speech  —   beginning with the long pause at the beginning as you seemed to be trying to gather the right words to say. And you talked about the need for unity. That’s the need you discussed. But I want to back up one step to the diagnosis. What is your diagnosis of the problem that needs to be addressed? I think we’ve got communities that are not nearly as successful at merging the community and law enforcement as others are. I think from what I can tell from listening to friends in the minority community who talk about this, as an everyday problem, that there are solutions out there that have to be gotten to that other communities haven’t replicated. I was talking to my friend Buster Suarez, who is a black pastor in Somerset, N. J. [at the] First Baptist Church there. Buster and the other black leaders in Somerset, a   community, worked with local law enforcement to set up a group that has instantaneous communications whenever something wrong occurs. And they’ve got  —   they’ve really basically fused and merged the minority community with the police department in a very effective way and they have a community policing system that works really, really well. OK, that’s not happening in all parts of America. So what I get out of that is: Let’s go learn from those, let’s go look at those solutions and let’s make sure other people know about it and try and replicate these success stories. So what I get out of this is, we need to learn and listen to people who are hurting, who believe just by the very color of their skin they don’t get treated fairly with respect to law enforcement. The fact that so many people believe that is a problem in this country. So let’s understand that, and then let’s go find out where they’ve solved that. And then let’s try and replicate that. That’s one of the reasons we formed this working group this week. Dave Reichert, good example, was a sheriff in Seattle. I talked with members of the black caucus who are representing these views. Who are representing their constituents. So what we’re trying to get are people with law enforcement backgrounds here in Congress, people who represent minority communities, especially young black youth, to come together to say where are we, where can we help with community policing? Where can we help with getting these solutions spread and passed around? And where can we get law enforcement training improved so that we have good training that’s going around the country so that these kinds of problems don’t get out of control? You said that people of color believe they’re less safe, that they feel they are less safe. When you look at the statistics is it clear to you that people of color actually are less safe? Well, yeah, I take them, look at Tim Scott. I take him at his word. I mean, Tim’s a buddy of mine. Did you see that speech he gave on the floor the other day? South Carolina senator, you’re saying. Yeah, sorry, I should’ve explained. That’s OK, go on. Yeah, I think statistics  —   I won’t go into statistics because I don’t have them off the top of my head, but I do believe that this is a problem because people are telling me it’s a problem and I believe them. Here’s something else that I’ve heard about you. Somebody who’s interested in policy was saying, expressing the belief, that you’re a policy guy, that President Obama’s basically a policy guy, and they said if Obama and Ryan could just close themselves in a room, they would work everything out or a lot of things out. Do you believe that that’s true? Well, we differ on so many things from just a core philosophical standpoint. So let’s just take, say, budget. Or entitlements  —   health care, in particular. I don’t think that’s true. He and I have just such divergent beliefs on how the health care system ought to be organized. I think the tax code  —   I mean, I’ve had a lot of conversations with him about these things. I do believe though we have been able to endeavor to find common ground. Look at what we’ve gotten done in the last seven or eight months. Opioids, we just signed that into law today. Or we sent that to the president today. We had the biggest transportation bill since the  . We had the biggest   education reform in 25 years. We rewrote all of our customs laws. We’re in the middle of making great progress on our cancer legislation. The president calls it the ”Moonshot” we call it ”The Cure.” It’s the same thing. So, Puerto Rico’s a good example. Puerto Rico is in dire trouble. The president and I have spoken about this issue many, many times. And we did and we worked together. And he and I talked quite a bit about this, about Puerto Rico legislation to put Puerto Rico on a good track. So where we could find that we could find room for common ground, we’ve done that and we’re doing that. We actually are doing that right now. We just passed mental health legislation here last week. Huge bipartisan vote rewriting our mental health laws for the first time in a generation. I think we’ll get that into law. I see a real chance at that outcome. So what I’ve discovered in this job or I’ve tried to do in this job, go find those places where there can be common ground. He and I have spoken about these things many times. But then there are just going to be issues where we just don’t agree. And I just described a couple of them like health care or tax legislation and others. Criminal justice reform is another one that he and I have talked about where I hope we can get consensus. I think we can, but the Senate’s a tough place to work with these days. But I think that’s another issue. I wanna know if there’s going to be . .. I guess the answer: Sometimes and not other times. Gotcha. Gotcha. I want to know if there’s going to be common ground on guns. There’s a particular detail of this I’d like to know. I know there’s some legislation you’ve discussed that you’ve pushed back to September. I would like to know if there is something on the subject of gun violence that in the interest of unity you’re willing to embrace even though it would be very difficult for you politically or otherwise. I don’t worry about political difficulty I worry about the Constitution. And I worry about due process rights. The proposals that have been sent to us violate the Fifth Amendment rights of citizens. I’m not going to advance legislation that in my mind and in my eyes violates . .. You’re talking about the terrorist watch list denying them weapons. Yeah, anybody can be placed on these watch lists and there’s no due process. So we cannot give the power to bureaucracy to unilaterally suspend a person’s due process rights. That is something that I would like to think people from all sides of the aisle would join us in defending. But having said that, let’s take a look at the fact that if there is someone on a terror watch list and they go try to buy a gun, do we want to make sure that law enforcement has the tools to prevent that sale from occurring if they think it’s a threat, of course we do. I mean, of course we do. That’s what we’re trying to figure out, which is how do we give law enforcement tools they need to stop a person from getting a gun who is on one of these watch lists without denying a person their due process rights. And that’s what we’re trying to get right. What the FBI also tells us is be careful how you do this so that you don’t tip off people that they’re on a watch list in some cases. That’s the other thing we have to worry about, which is there are a lot of terror investigations out there where people don’t know that they’re subject to a terror investigation because they’re trying to get their fact pattern, they’re trying to get the networks figured out. So we want to make sure that we get this right. There was an attempt here to rush something through law and we don’t want to screw up terror investigations, we don’t want to mess with people’s due process rights, we want to get it right. And that’s why I find in all of these issues  —   this is my 18th year in Congress  —   if you move when the issue is so passionate, you often get critical details wrong and you end up doing things that you have to fix later on. So I’d rather just figure out how to get this done right and that’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. One other thing Mr. Speaker, we’re talking as Donald Trump is preparing to announce his vice presidential choice. I presume you don’t know who it is? I don’t. However, you know what it’s like. Yeah, that’s for sure. You’re the last person to do this. If the nominee, the choice, were to call you for advice, what would you ask? What would you suggest? Oh, if it’s  —   you mean, if the running mate were to call me? What is your advice for Donald Trump’s running mate? I would basically say, be yourself. The first wave is, they come and try and sort of  —   what happens is, if you’re going to be picked, you’re going to be a person that vets well. But nevertheless, everybody, they’re going to sort of dig through your life. Just know that’s going to happen, be prepared for that. Get thick skin. As you get thick skin don’t make it impermeable skin. Don’t lose who you are, don’t lose your personality. And then, what you end up doing is you worry, you don’t want to screw up. You don’t want to undermine the campaign. Don’t become too overly scripted. Make sure that you’re actually naturally yourself. And just represent yourself in the way you want to. The one thing that I sort of  —   you know, looking back at it is, I think, so many events are so canned. So many events are so scripted. And, by the way, they’re with just your supporters. I think it’s really important that in presidential campaigns, we try to get a little outside our comfort zones. We get out of just doing rallies. And we get out into the country to speak with nontraditional voters who aren’t used to seeing Republicans and who haven’t heard our message. And that’s the kind of campaign that I think we ought to have, I wish we would have. Not just as Republicans, but just you know, we would see in America. And I would encourage that running mate to do that. What do you mean nontraditional Republicans? Do you mean minority groups? Yeah, going to the minority communities. Go into the inner cities. Go into bastions of Democrats and present your case. Give people in this country a flavor of what our ideas look like. And basically for the running mate, you got a few things you gotta do right. You got to give a good speech at the convention. You got to have a good debate. So you can’t mess those  —   and, oh, you have to have a good launch day. So . .. basically three things: Launch well, good speech, good debate. And then help that nominee  —   and the other thing that actually occurs is there’s a transition occurring in all of this. We have a law that you basically set up a shadow government so to speak, which is our government preparing to govern should you win. I spent a lot of time on that with Mike Leavitt, who was our head of transition. Spend time on that. Once the running mate is done with his or her debate, you’ve got a good month there. And you need to focus on that transition so that if you win you’ve got everything working in the right direction. So I hope he picks someone that is a good conservative that has some experience that can help him govern, that can help him set up a government. And that’s something that person has to put a lot of thought into and some time and attention to. And also just sort of be yourself. That’s the last thing I would say is just be yourself. Mr. Speaker thanks very much. You bet, my pleasure."
"Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out America’s struggles with crime, terrorism and immigration and how he plans to address them. NPR’s politics team has annotated Trump’s speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics. Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States. USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. Who would have believed that when we started this journey    because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed this. Who would have believed this. The Democrats on the other hand received 20 percent fewer votes than they got four years ago. Not so good. Not so good. Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order. [Law and order has become a big theme for Trump in recent weeks, particularly since the killings of five police officers in Dallas.  —   Sarah McCammon] Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country. Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.  Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.  [Policing, public safety and the vast majority of the criminal justice apparatus are controlled by state and local authorities, not the federal government.  —   Carrie Johnson] The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead. It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation. I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore. So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the   lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there. But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.  [Fact checkers might beg to differ. PolitiFact, for instance, has found a number of false statements uttered at this week’s RNC.  —   Tamara Keith]  These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years.  [These data seem to come from a January Washington Post analysis that found homicides were up by 17 percent in 2015 over 2014, and that it indeed was the largest increase since 1990.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben]  [However, violent crime is an intensely local phenomenon and murders were not up in all of those 50 cities.  —   Carrie Johnson]  [And there’s a broader context for crime figures: While violent crime may be climbing this year, rates are far below their peak in the early 1990s.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] [Americans in recent years have said they believe crime is getting worse even though the overall trend is down.  —   Sarah McCammon] In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore. [That same Post analysis found murders up by 54. 3 percent in Washington, D. C. and 58. 5 percent in Baltimore in 2015 over 2014.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2, 000 people have been the victims of shootings this year alone. [Just three days ago, the Chicago Tribune reported that nearly 2, 200 people have been shot in Chicago this year, with 329 of those people dead. The Tribune also reported that that’s 100 more such deaths than at this point last year.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] And more than 4, 000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year.  [The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund says as of July 21, 2016, total fatalities this year compared with the same time last year reflect an increase of five deaths, or 8 percent. Deaths related to firearms are up by 14 deaths, or 78 percent.  —   Carrie Johnson] Nearly 180, 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.  [The number of families apprehended this fiscal year along the Southwestern border thus far (that is, starting in October 2015) is around 51, 000, according to Border Patrol data. That is already over the nearly 40, 000 apprehended during fiscal year 2015. Total apprehensions are also on pace to exceed their 2015 total, as well, according to these data. However, that wouldn’t be a very high number in the context of recent years total apprehensions at the border today are far, far lower than they were in the early 2000s.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such   was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21   and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4. 0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law. I’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.  [America does not have ”open borders.” It has restrictions on immigration and Border Patrol agents who make hundreds of thousands of apprehensions a year.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] What about our economy? Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly 4 in 10   children are living in poverty, while 58% of   youth are now not employed.  [  percent of   under 18 were below the poverty line as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. It’s not entirely clear what Trump means by ”not employed,” which is not technically the same as ”unemployed,” which counts people who aren’t working and are looking for work. However, the unemployment rate for black Americans ages 16 to 19 was 38. 1 percent as of June.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.  [That’s roughly true, by the latest data available. Around 11 million   were in poverty in 2008, compared with 13. 1 million in 2014. The poverty rate makes more sense to compare, though  —   that has grown 0. 4 points since 2008, but it has also declined lately, down by nearly 3 points since 2010. As for whether President Obama is responsible for this, we get to that below.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.  [There’s a lot going on in this statistic. So here goes: Trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force  —   that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). That figure has climbed by 14 million since January 2009 (importantly, this isn’t people leaving the labor force it’s just people not in it, period). But while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing  —   Trump’s 14 million figure might imply that it’s not. And that low labor force participation isn’t entirely about a tough economy  —   a lot of it is simple demographics. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office found that half of a recent   drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. The other half was economic factors.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Household incomes are down more than $4, 000 since the year 2000. That’s sixteen years ago. [That’s true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the Obama administration as he is for the other stats here. If he measured from 2008, the drop was $1, 656. Measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure’s  . [A broader point about all of these economic statistics: A lot of them have been true, but the question is whether Obama is to blame. Higher poverty, for example, doesn’t appear to be Obama’s doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. Moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Our trade deficit has reached an   high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone. We’re going to fix that. The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and   million Americans are on food stamps. Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they’ve lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing  —   it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. [PolitiFact has debunked this  —   that $150 billion is an estimate (and a high one) of the value of Iranian assets tied up by economic sanctions, according to the site.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria  —   and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate  —   the symbol of American prestige around the globe  —   was brought down in flames. [The diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was not a consulate. Here’s how former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell described it in a Politico article: [”The State Department facility in Benghazi has been widely mischaracterized as a US consulate. In fact it was a Temporary Mission Facility (TMF) a presence that was not continuously staffed by senior personnel and that was never given formal diplomatic status by the Libyan government.”  —   Tamara Keith] America is far less safe  —   and the world is far less stable  —   than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy. [Editor’s note: Crowd chants ”Lock her up. ”] Let’s defeat her in November, okay? I am certain that it was a decision that President Obama truly regrets. [President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed Clinton, so it would seem unlikely that he regrets choosing her to be his secretary of state.  —   Tamara Keith] Her bad instincts and her bad judgment  —   something pointed out by Bernie Sanders  —   are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let’s review the record. In 2009,   ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy.  [Attacks on Hillary Clinton and the argument that she is part of the status quo that is making many Americans unhappy in their lives are a common theme at Trump rallies.  —   Sarah McCammon] The problems we face now  —   poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad  —   will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. [Many of these ideas are familiar: making better trade deals, fighting terrorism, putting ”America first,” and the notion that only a dramatic change in the leadership of the country will be able to solve national problems.  —   Sarah McCammon] Tonight, I will share with you my plan for action for America. The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. The respect that we deserve. The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home  —   which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America. A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That’s because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It’s for their benefit. Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings. That is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. Never ever. [Clinton has reams of plans and proposals to change everything from the nation’s immigration system and criminal justice policies to the way people pay for college.  —   Tamara Keith] My message is that things have to change  —   and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the   factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten. But they’re not going to be forgotten long. These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice. I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice   [Editor’s note: Protester interrupts, crowd shouts ”USA”] How great are our police! And how great is Cleveland? Thank you. I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws  —   or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash  —   I am not able to look the other way. And I won’t look the other way. And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33, 000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence  —   I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country. [There was no official determination that the private server was illegal, although the State Department inspector general found it was not approved and would not have been had Clinton asked.  —   Carrie Johnson] When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ”extremely careless” and ”negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.  [FBI Director James Comey had plenty of criticism for Clinton but said ”no reasonable prosecutor” would charge Clinton with a crime for the emails.  —   Carrie Johnson] They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes. In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it  —   especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come. I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me. Which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders  —   he never had a chance. Never had a chance. But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip our country of its jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country. [Sanders had a lot of issues that he was deeply passionate about, including trade, but it wouldn’t be at the top of his list. His campaign revolved most intensely around two things: income inequality and a broken campaign finance system.  —   Tamara Keith] Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans. [A recent Pew poll found that just 9 percent of Democratic and   Sanders supporters said they planned to vote for Trump in the general election. ”85% say they plan to vote for Clinton in the general election, compared with 9% who say they will vote for Trump and 6% who volunteer that they will vote for another candidate or don’t know.”  [Sanders got approximately 12 million popular votes.     calculation, 9 percent of 12 million is a bit more than 1 million, not millions. And that poll was taken before Sanders endorsed Clinton.  —   Tamara Keith] In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy. We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. Which is amazing. He’s a man of character and accomplishment. He’s the man for the job. [Trump is saying that he and Pence will improve U. S. trade deals, but trade is just one of several areas on which they differ. Pence has been a strong proponent of free trade in the past, having approved of NAFTA and the   Partnership, as the New York Times reports.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me. Believe me. I will work with, and appoint, the best and brightest prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done.  [The president does select U. S. attorneys, but those top federal prosecutors handle a small fraction of violent crime cases in the nation. Most murders, robberies and assaults are prosecuted by local authorities.  —   Carrie Johnson] In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.  The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.  [The Brennan Center for Justice says overall crime rates from 2014 to 2015 were ”nearly identical.” Violent crime rose by 3 percent over that period.  —   Carrie Johnson] This Administration has failed America’s inner cities. Remember, it has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them in every way and at every single level. When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have really, in every way folks, the same right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? Any other child. To make life safe for all of our citizens, we must also address the growing threats from outside the country. We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we’re going to defeat them fast. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over  —   at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many many other locations. Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we’re going to stop it. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. [The party is well to Trump’s right on LGBT issues, as NPR’s Brian Naylor has reported. The Log Cabin Republicans have called it the ”most   platform” in GOP history, according to ABC News.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We’re going to win. We’re going to win fast. This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Recently, I have said NATO is obsolete because it did not properly cover terror. And also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the costs. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism. A true step in the right direction. Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don’t want them in our country. My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this. Think of this, this is not believable but this is what’s happening. A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. [PolitiFact ranked the claim about the lack of a vetting system false.  [However, PolitiFact did find that Trump’s number is correct as to the increase in refugee admissions proposed by Clinton. Interestingly, about a month ago, Trump said it would be a 500 percent increase. PolitiFact noted that it actually worked out to 550 percent. Trump has adjusted to the higher and more accurate number. [In 2015, the U. S. admitted (per the State Department) 1, 682 Syrian refugees. That is well under President Obama’s goal. It would be hard to argue that is ”massive.”  —   Tamara Keith] I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be. Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for   and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people. On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve. We have to solve it. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was the sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other, it’s so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents. And will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful. By ending    on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it, it won’t be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect that they deserve. Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied  —   and every politician who has denied them  —   to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say. On January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone. But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. USA. USA. USA.  [Editor’s note: Trump chanted along with the crowd here.] My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they’re going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class. I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. Of which there are many. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office. I have made billions of dollars in business making deals  —   now I’m going to make our country rich again. Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost   third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Remember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country. Or frankly, any other country. Never ever again.  [As we have pointed out in two earlier Trump speech annotations, and as NPR’s Chris Arnold reported this year, it appears that NAFTA didn’t have a huge effect on jobs. As the Congressional Research Service reported in 2015, the agreement neither lived up to proponents’ promises nor caused the massive job losses that opponents claimed it would. Also, Bill Clinton was not solely responsible for NAFTA it was negotiated under George H. W. Bush before it became law under Clinton.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America  —   and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore. My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization  —   another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the   trade deal with South Korea. She supported the   Partnership. Which will not only destroy our manufacturers, but will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it’s not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence. We will never sign bad trade deals. America First again. America First. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long  —   and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations, against any country that cheats. This includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about. They are the greatest currency manipulators ever. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America  —   and we’ll walk away if we don’t get that kind of a deal. Our country is going to start building and making things again. Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year  —   Democrat or Republican.   Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone. I mean everyone. America is one of the   nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it’ll happen and it’ll happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest   of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly. [A few analyses have found that regulation costs around $2 trillion  —   one of the   from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, estimated it at around $1. 9 trillion this year. But as the Washington Post’s Fact Checker has pointed out, in the past this figure has been characterized as a ”back of the envelope” count, and that moreover, it doesn’t make sense to talk about costs without trying to count the benefits of regulation.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in   economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business  —   that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans  —   We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that’s what she’s doing. And that’s what’s she’s done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! Which is a total disaster. We’re going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out in their adult lives. Tremendous problem. We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share. We will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just released 10 point plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days on a line and dying. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal. One more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about this for years, but I’m going to do it. [Editor’s note: Crowd chants ”Yes You Will”] We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution. The replacement of our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe. At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I’ll tell you what. Because the support they’ve given me, and I’m not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing. And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their   status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away. [Here’s an IRS explanation of the rules on churches and taxes, saying that to be   a church may not ”participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements) any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.” This LA Times piece from 2008 is a breakdown of some of the arguments for and against the Johnson Amendment.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much more  —   all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back  —   bigger, and better and stronger than ever before. In this journey, I’m so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka, did they do a job. [There’s also a bit more of the personal in this speech. Trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. This week we’ve seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here.  —   Sarah McCammon] My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight. It’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people. Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and  . She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great great judge of character. She could pick ’em out from anywhere. To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have had a truly great life in business. But now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country  —   to go to work for you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don’t win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics. Remember: all of the people telling you you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn’t stand, I mean they said Trump doesn’t have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance. The same people. Oh we love defeating those people. Don’t we? Don’t we? Love it. Love it. Love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.  [Americans as a whole aren’t fans of the news media, but Republicans dislike the media even more. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 17 percent of Republicans say the national news media ”has a positive effect on the way things are going in the country,” compared with 33 percent of Democrats.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Instead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now. We don’t have much time, but history is watching. It’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I am asking for your support tonight so I can be your champion in the White House. And I will be your champion. My opponent asks her supporters to recite a   loyalty pledge. It reads: ”I’m With Her”. I choose to recite a different pledge. [”I’m With Her” started out as a hashtag and sometimes supporters do chant it at events, but the Clinton campaign doesn’t ask supporters to pledge loyalty by reciting it. The campaign’s current slogan is ”Stronger Together.”  —   Tamara Keith] My pledge reads: ”I’M WITH YOU  —   THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.” I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you. To all Americans tonight, in all of our cities and in all of our towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. God bless you, and goodnight. I love you."
"Editor’s note: This has been updated at 1:25 p. m. ET Friday with additional   information. Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs. NPR’s politics team annotated Clinton’s speech below. Portions commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics. (You can read our fact check of Donald Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week here.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all so so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we’ve had. [A few thank yous at the top of a speech are not uncommon, but look at all the people Clinton thanks here at the top of her speech. This is something she does at every single campaign event. She thanks local elected officials, she thanks her top volunteers and campaign organizers by name. The scale and consistency of the thank yous are a trademark of Clinton’s understated campaign style.  —    Tamara Keith] And Chelsea, thank you. I’m so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you’ve become. Thank you for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world. And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago, it is still going strong. You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us. And I’ve even gotten a few words in along the way. On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my    is still on the job. I’m also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime. For all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight, and to those of you who joined this campaign this week. Thank you. What a remarkable week it’s been. We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. [Bill Clinton grew up in Hope, Ark. and The Man From Hope is the title of a biographical film shown during the 1992 Democratic National Convention. The last line of Bill Clinton’s acceptance speech in 1992 was: ”I end tonight where it all began for me: I still believe in a place called Hope.”  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] And the man of Hope, Barack Obama. America is stronger because of President Obama’s leadership, and I’m better because of his friendship. We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden. He spoke from his big heart about our party’s commitment to working people, as only he can do. And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too. And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine  —   you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator. And he will make the whole country proud as our vice president. And . .. I want to thank Bernie Sanders. Bernie, Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary. [Sanders won 12 million votes in the Democratic primaries, to Clinton’s 15. 8 million, according to RealClearPolitics. And Clinton is right about young people’s devotion to Sanders: As the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake found, Sanders won more   votes this primary season than Clinton and Trump combined.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] You’ve put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong. And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I’ve heard you. Your cause is our cause. [After the speech, I spoke to several Sanders supporters in the arena who appreciated the acknowledgement but still weren’t convinced that she really meant it.  —   Tamara Keith] Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion. That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together  —   now let’s go out and make it happen together. My friends, we’ve come to Philadelphia  —   the birthplace of our nation  —   because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today. We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out  —   and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all. When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king. And some wanted to stick it to the king. The revolution hung in the balance. Then somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That’s what made it possible to stand up to a king. That took courage. They had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together. Now, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together. Our country’s motto is ”e pluribus unum”: out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump’s answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other. He’s betting that the perils of today’s world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He’s taken the Republican Party a long way from ”Morning in America” to ”Midnight in America.” He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: ”The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” Now we are   about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one. And we’ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy! We, we will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism. [Donald Trump initially called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the U. S. following the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack last December. But he now talks about fighting terrorism through a temporary ban on people from countries with a known history of terrorism.  —   Tamara Keith] There’s a lot of work to do. Too many people haven’t had a pay raise since the crash. There’s too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad. But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we’ve ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that those words are associated with us. I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America. So don’t let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We’re not. Don’t let anyone tell you we don’t have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don’t believe anyone who says, ”I alone can fix it.” Yes, those were actually Donald Trump’s words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us. Really? I alone can fix it? Isn’t he forgetting? Troops on the front lines. Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe. He’s forgetting every last one of us. Americans don’t say, ”I alone can fix it.” We say, ”We’ll fix it together.” [In his convention speech, Trump did say ”I alone can fix it”  —   he was referring to the political system he sees as broken. Clinton first used this line of attack the Friday after the GOP convention and it has been   by supporters ever since. Clinton is taking the phrase beyond Trump’s original context, but there are certainly other instances in his convention speech and others where he has portrayed himself as the one who can fix various ills from ISIS to the economy.  —   Tamara Keith] And remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.     years later, we still put our faith in each other. Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. [According to data posted on the Dallas Police Department Facebook page, 467 people applied to the department between July 8 and July 20. That’s more than triple the 136 people that applied between June 8 and June 20.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] That’s how Americans answer when the call for help goes out. Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village. And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, ”What the heck do you mean by that?” This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone. America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart. That’s why ”Stronger Together” is not just a lesson from our history. It’s not just a slogan for our campaign. It’s a guiding principle for the country we’ve always been and the future we’re going to build. A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate. That’s the country we’re fighting for. That’s the future we’re working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America’s promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States! Now, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I’m not one of those people. I’ve been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York. Then I represented all of you as secretary of state. But my job titles only tell you what I’ve done. They don’t tell you why. The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ”service” part has always come easier to me than the ”public” part. I get it that some people just don’t know what to make of me. So let me tell you. The family I’m from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had  —   whatever God gave them  —   and whatever life in America provided  —   and built better lives and better futures for their kids. My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right. My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. Sheended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her   teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: ”Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.” So, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund, going    in New Bedford, Mass. on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school  —   it just didn’t seem possible in those days. And I couldn’t stop thinking of my mother and what she’d gone through as a child. It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities. It’s a big idea, isn’t it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school. But how, how do you make an idea like that real? You do it       sometimes even   . My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage  —   because we changed our law to make sure she got an education. So it’s true. I sweat the details of policy  —   whether we’re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich. the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs. Because it’s not just a detail if it’s your kid  —   if it’s your family. It’s a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too. After the four days of this convention, you’ve seen some of the people who’ve inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine. People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night. I first met Ryan as a   . He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children’s Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country. [CHIP had 8. 1 million kids on the rolls as of 2015. And while Clinton wasn’t in the legislature, she was instrumental in getting it passed, as PolitiFact found earlier this year.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on  . It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of   families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero. I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice. And in this campaign, I’ve met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House. And you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don’t. For all Americans together. Tonight, tonight we’ve reached a milestone in our nation’s march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president. Standing here, standing here as my mother’s daughter, and my daughter’s mother, I’m so happy this day has come. I’m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. I’m happy for boys and men, too  —   because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky’s the limit. So let’s keep going, let’s keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have. But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead. Let’s begin with what we’re going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead. Now, I don’t think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new   jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever.  [The   figure Clinton cites is from the trough, which came about a year after President Obama took office. The insurance figure includes those who gained coverage through new insurance exchanges, expansion of Medicaid, and changes in the private insurance market that allow young adults to stay on their parents’ plan. U. S. auto sales hit 17. 5 million last year, an   high.  —   Scott Horsley]  Now that’s real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot. We’re still facing   problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery. I’ve gone around our country talking to working families. And I’ve heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn’t working for them. Some of you are frustrated  —   even furious. And you know what? You’re right. It’s not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work  —   and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period. Democrats, we are the party of working people. But we haven’t done a good enough job showing we get what you’re going through, and we’re going to do something to help. So tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives. My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures. And here’s what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn’t working the way it should because our democracy isn’t working the way it should. That’s why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. [With this oversimplified phrase, Clinton is effectively calling for   public financing, which is extremely unlikely.  —   Peter Overby] And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.  [Passing a constitutional amendment would very likely be really, really, really hard in the current political climate of gridlock. Proposing one requires either a   vote of the House and Senate or a constitutional convention, which   of the states would have to call for, according to the National Archives. To be ratified, it requires 38 of the 50 states to approve it.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] [And not even advocates of this one can agree on language that avoids other First Amendment issues.  —   Peter Overby] I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren’t. It’s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. And I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of   clean energy jobs. I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be   and inhumane to try to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together  —   and it’s the right thing to do. [The Congressional Budget Office projected the immigration bill passed by the Senate in 2013 would boost the economy and reduce the federal deficit, while slightly reducing wages.  —   Scott Horsley] So, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign. [This is part of Clinton’s occasional outreach to both Sanders supporters and people she once called ”reasonable Republicans.” At the convention Thursday night, speakers included a former Ronald Reagan staffer and a woman who is leading a group of Republican women supporting Clinton.  —    Tamara Keith] If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us. If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us. If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us. If you believe that we should say ”no” to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us. If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions, then join us. And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us. That’s how we’re going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Now, you didn’t hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for   minutes  —   and I do mean odd. And he offered zero solutions. [Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland offered a number of measures to address the various problems he defined. They included Trump’s ban on Muslims entering the United States, which he now describes as a proposal for the U. S. to ”suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.” Trump also reiterated his call for a border wall to combat illegal immigration, new trade policies (in addition to renegotiating ”bad trade agreements”) infrastructure investment and tax reform. Clinton has argued these proposals are wrong or not feasible, and therefore aren’t solutions. But the statement suggests Trump’s speech was devoid of specific proposals, which is not true.  —   Arnie Seipel] But we already know he doesn’t believe these things. No wonder he doesn’t like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine. In my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new,   jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we’ll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs. Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college   for the middle class and   for all! [Clinton originally had a ” ” college plan, which was designed to ensure that people could attend college without taking out loans that meant the student had to work and that the family would contribute what it could. But in July, she moved further in her primary rival Bernie Sanders’ direction, proposing that college tuition at public universities for students from families making $125, 000 or less (a threshold that would be phased in) would be free.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It’s just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can’t refinance their debts. And something we don’t say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a   degree should not be the only path to a good job.  [The income gap between high school and college grads is bigger for millennials than it was for Generation Xers, baby boomers and the Silent Generation, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it. We will give small businesses like my dad’s a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we will help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ”woman card,” then deal me in. Now, here’s the other thing, we’re not only going to make all these investments, we’re going to pay for every single one of them. And here’s how: Wall Street, corporations, and the   are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. This is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that’s where the money is, and we are going to follow the money. [In his convention speech, Bernie Sanders said something similar, saying that 85 percent of the income gains had gone to the top 1 percent  —   a stat that PolitiFact called ”half true” because it was outdated. In 2014 and 2015, they write, the 99 percent’s incomes recovered, and the top 1 percent’s share fell to 52 percent.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we’ll make them pay us back. And we’ll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home! Now, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Well, look at my record. I’ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that’s what I’ll do as president. But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he’s a businessman. He must know something about the economy. Well, let’s take a closer look. In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills. Now, remember what the president said last night: ”Don’t boo, vote.” People who did the work and needed the money, and didn’t get it  —   not because he couldn’t pay them, but because he wouldn’t pay them. He just stiffed them. [True. Specifically, she is referring to the losses suffered by contractors on the Taj Mahal casino. The Associated Press found that Trump owed $70 million to 253 contractors when the casino opened. After the casino filed for bankruptcy about a year later, many contractors got just 33 percent of what they were owed. As a result some went out of business.  [It’s unclear whether Trump could have paid those bills, as Clinton argued. He was deeply overleveraged on the project, with extensive debt, and both his corporate and personal finances were in relatively poor shape at the time.  —   Matt Katz, WNYC] And you know that sales pitch he’s making to be president? Put your faith in him  —   and you’ll win big? That’s the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag. He also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of ”America First” leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again  —   well, he could start by actually making things in America again. Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security. You know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we’re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated. So, it’s no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority. I’m proud that we put a lid on Iran’s nuclear program without firing a single shot  —   now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel’s security.  [Experts believe the agreement has lengthened the time Iran would need to develop a nuclear bomb from weeks or months to at least a year. However, the deal has had little effect on Iran’s nonnuclear troublemaking elsewhere in the region.  —   Scott Horsley] I’m proud that we shaped a global climate agreement  —   now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves. And I’m proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia. I’ve laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won’t be easy or quick, but make no mistake  —   we will prevail. Now Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ”I know more about ISIS than the generals do.” No, Donald, you don’t. He thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ”a disaster.” [Trump said, ”Our military is a disaster,” in a debate in Charleston, S. C. hosted by the Fox Business Network on Jan. 14, 2016.  —   Arnie Seipel] Well, I’ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death. A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country  —   including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines. So just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump can’t even handle the    of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he’s gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he’s challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally. Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can’t put it, I can’t put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with   and restraint, but by little men  —   the ones moved by fear and pride. America’s strength doesn’t come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. And that’s the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be. And if we’re serious about keeping our country safe, we also can’t afford to have a president who’s in the pocket of the gun lobby. I’m not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I’m not here to take away your guns. I just don’t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn’t have a gun in the first place. We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass   reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm. You know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage. You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals. I refuse to believe we can’t find common ground here. We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more. And that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other’s shoes. So let’s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job. We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. And we will defend, we will defend all our rights  —   civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women’s rights and workers’ rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities! And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from. You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump’s comments  —   excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show. They thought he couldn’t possibly mean all the horrible things he says  —   like when he called women ”pigs.” Or said that an American judge couldn’t be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain  —   a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect. Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn’t believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom  —   that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that. But here’s the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it. And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn’t get: that America is great  —   because America is good. [After Clinton’s speech, there were claims on Twitter that this quote was lifted from Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America. Interestingly, the Weekly Standard found in 1995 that it is a line of unknown provenance, often misattributed to de Tocqueville. Reagan used it (by way, his speechwriters said, of Eisenhower) as well as Pat Buchanan and Bill Clinton, the Weekly Standard wrote.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump’s not offering real change. He’s offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country  —   to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve. The choice is clear, my friends. Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger. None of us ever have or can do it alone. I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we’ll ever pull together. But I’m here to tell you tonight  —   progress is possible. I know, I know because I’ve seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up. And I know it, I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I’ve had to pick myself up and get back in the game. Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. ”Go back out there,” she said. And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies. You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce. We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what. That’s what we need to do together as a nation. Though ”we may not live to see the glory,” as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ”let us gladly join the fight.” Let our legacy be about ”planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.” That’s why we’re here . .. not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since. They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight. Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America’s destiny is ours to choose. So let’s be stronger together, my fellow Americans. Let’s look to the future with courage and confidence. Let’s build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. And when we do, America will be greater than ever. Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!"
"Editor’s note: NPR will also be   Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s planned economic speech this Thursday. Donald Trump is coming off a week of disastrous headlines and cratering poll numbers. His major economic speech on Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, a vision described by his campaign as ”Winning the Global Competition,” was a chance to turn the page. During an address of just over an hour  —   which was interrupted multiple times by protesters  —   the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a new iteration of his proposal to reshape America’s tax system. It has just three tax brackets (one fewer than the tax plan he released in September, which was removed from his website in the past 24 hours) would limit taxes on all forms of business income to 15 percent, would end the estate tax and would ”exclude childcare expenses from taxation.” Other highlights include a proposed moratorium on all new federal regulations and would ”remove bureaucrats who only know how to kill jobs [and] replace them with experts who know how to create jobs,” according to a preview released by his campaign. It’s unclear exactly what that means or how it would work, but there are currently about 2. 7 million civilian federal employees. As for trade, which has been a centerpiece of his economic agenda, Trump reiterated calls for the U. S. to pull out of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and for NAFTA to be renegotiated. He said would appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to ”win for America,” and he would apply tariffs on countries that cheat. Economists have raised concerns in the past that such tariffs could lead to a trade war that would ultimately hurt American interests. Speaking at a rally later Monday afternoon in Florida, Hillary Clinton didn’t pass up the opportunity to criticize Trump’s economic speech. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while Trump’s could cost the country more than 3 million. She also accused Trump of ”scrambling to do damage control” by listing a new group of economic advisers. ”He’s got, I don’t know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named: Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently. And so they wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. Now, they tried to make his old tired ideas sound new. But here’s what we all know, because we heard it again. His tax plans will give super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech, right,” said Clinton. ”He wants to basically just repackage   economics.” Below is Trump’s speech in its entirety, with annotations and   from NPR’s team of political and economic reporters. Thank you everybody, thank you very much. Thank you. Such a crowd   beautiful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Please. Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s wonderful to be in Detroit. I’ve been here many times. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It’s a conversation about how to make America great again   for everyone, especially and I say especially, for those who have the very least. The city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families and lived out, totally, lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished. [One measure of Detroit’s decline: As of 1950, it had more than 1. 8 million residents. Today, it’s fewer than 700, 000.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities in the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair. Yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15K   about half of the national average. [True. Detroit’s per capita income, which includes retirees and children, is $14, 810 per year. This is roughly half the national average of $28, 889. The median household income in Detroit is $25, 769, roughly half the national average of $53, 657.   Huntsberry] 40% of the city’s residents live in poverty, over two and a half times the national average.  [This is true. The most recent figures show Detroit’s poverty rate is 39. 3 percent, which is more than the double the national average of 15. 5 percent.   Huntsberry] The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. [This is technically true. Detroit city proper has an unemployment rate of 11. 6 percent, which is twice the national average of 4. 9 percent. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics often figures these numbers by metro area. The Detroit metro area has an unemployment rate of 5. 8 percent.   Huntsberry] Half of all Detroit residents do not work. [It is true, according to the most recent data, that less than half of Detroiters have a job, but this figure includes small children and retirees. The ’  ratio,’ as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that 43. 9 percent of Detroiters had a job in 2014, while 59 percent of people in the United States had a job the same year. A more often cited statistic, which removes people younger than 16 from the calculus, is the ’participation rate.’ It was 53. 4 percent in Detroit and 62. 9 percent for the United States.   Huntsberry] Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime. [Recent FBI data do show that among major cities, Detroit has the highest violent crime rate. However, the FBI also cautions against comparing cities’ rates, as many factors, like population density, can affect a city’s rate.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] These are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton. But victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent’s failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton. [Detroit’s decline began more than 50 years ago, decades before NAFTA and other trade deals. Hillary Clinton wasn’t in elected office or even first lady then.   Keith]  She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe. And the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future. This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. One hundred percent. [Mayor Mike Duggan is a Democrat, and they city’s mayors have been Democratic since 1962. But Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder is a Republican.  —   Jessica Taylor] Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out (protesters interrupt) . ..thank you everybody. This is what happens when you go from thirty five people to close to two thousand people, I guess.  —   in the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website. Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that. If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn’t do better than Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. And that’s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart. My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like. First, let’s talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton  —   who has spent her career voting for tax increases  —   plans another massive   $1. 3   tax increase. Big increase   one of the biggest ever. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent. Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton     you know this, you’ve heard this one   Hillary Clinton   again  —   to use a now famous term  —   when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class. [Politifact has rated this claim ”pants on fire,” but Trump continues to say it at events, including in this highly scripted speech. Clinton has campaigned extensively on not raising taxes on the middle class. His campaign has circulated a misleading video with a caption saying she said she wants to raise taxes on the middle class, but you can hear she says ”we aren’t going to raise taxes on the middle class”   Tamara Keith] I am proposing an    income tax reduction, especially for   Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really   jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction, a   deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. [Many politicians argue that streamlining the U. S. tax code is a good idea. However, cutting the number of brackets doesn’t do a whole lot to simplify things.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.  [Last September Donald Trump released a tax plan with four tax brackets: 0, 10, 20 and 25 percent. It was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive. The new proposal eliminates the 0 percent bracket, thus making this line from Trump’s original tax plan null: ”If you are single and earn less than $25, 000, or married and jointly earn less than $50, 000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households  —   over 50%  —   from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, ”I win,” those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1, 000 each.”   Keith] [UPDATE: In an interview with Fox News Wednesday morning, Trump said the zero bracket is in there ”big league. ”] For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero. While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in all or in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. We will Make America Grow Again. In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and most importantly your family. It will present a    contrast to the         agenda. So important   the State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton’s failed leadership. The Washington Post just published today a devastating article on Hillary Clinton’s broken promises.  [Here is that article.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] She pledged 200, 000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator. But what happened? What happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: ”upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging   levels, plunging nearly 25 percent. ..the former first lady was totally unable to pass big ticket legislation. .. Many promised jobs they were all promised, I remember it so well. ..”Vote for Hillary   she’ll bring back your jobs” many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run which also was a disaster. Data shows that upstate actually lost jobs a lot them during Clinton’s first term. In other words, she was all talk, no action, upstate New York is a disaster. What’s happened to upstate New York. And NAFTA, which her husband signed, is a very, very big reason. [Bill Clinton did sign NAFTA, but it’s misleading to attribute that policy entirely to him. In fact, it was negotiated under George H. W. Bush, who signed it in 1992, as the Washington Post’s Fact Checker has pointed out. After Congress passed it, Clinton then signed it into law in 1993.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, ”How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,” the paper writes that I  —   and this is a direct quote in other words, it’s not from me (crowd interruption) thank you. ..it’s all very well planned out  —   and this is a direct quote that basically Donald Trump ”waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the   mugging ground that was Central Park so dangerous and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out. ..then almost by sheer force of will  —   [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead.” True. Have to say. I didn’t say it. They said it. It’s true. This is what I want to do. ... We all remember New York City was a disaster. We made it great. We made it great. This is want I want to do for our country  —   I want to jumpstart America. And it can be done. And it won’t even be that hard. Now let’s look at what the   policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1. 2% growth, the weakest   recovery since the Great Depression, it’s been written about all over, it’s a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the Obama years. There are now 94. 3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80. 5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people. [His numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13. 8 million, according to the Labor Department). However, this statistic alone is misleading. The number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since January 2009. It’s true that the labor force participation rate  —   the share of Americans in the labor force  —   is low in recent years. However, as of 2014, the Congressional Budget Office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] The   agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years. [Homeownership recently hit a   low, as the Associated Press recently reported. However, the homeownership rate can be deceiving, as Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko wrote in 2014 at the New York Times. For some young adults who live with their parents, renting their own apartments could be a sign of economic progress. But as they go out and create their own households in those rented apartments, that could push down the homeownership rate (measured as a share of all households) even while their situations are improving.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] (More protesters interrupt) Thank you. ..I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit, I will say. Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp and, these people are growing and growing so rapidly, since President Obama took office. [According to annual totals, more than 12 million more people were receiving SNAP benefits in 2015 than in 2009. However, Trump is wrong that the total is ”growing and growing so rapidly.” The total number of recipients has fallen every month since December 2015, according to the USDA. And by the annual numbers, participation has been falling since 2013.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Another nearly 7 million people, great Americans, are right now living in poverty. [The number of Americans in poverty grew by 6. 8 million from 2008, the year before Obama took office, through 2014, the latest year of data available. The poverty rate (a better measure here, though it’s still very flawed) is up by 1. 6 percentage points, to 14. 8 percent, though it is down from a high of 15. 1 in 2010. Numbers aside, though, it’s hard to blame President Obama for all these increases  —   for example, poverty was already rising when he took office.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades. [His numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate  —   the share of people working or looking for work  —   right now is at 62. 8 percent. That rate hit a recent low of 62. 4 percent in September 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. The last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. However, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. As we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i. e. Baby Boomers retiring) so the decline in the rate isn’t entirely a bad thing.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben]  58 percent of the   youth are either outside the labor force or not employed. [Trump pointed to this table from the Labor Department, and the data do show that 58. 5 percent of   age 16 to 24 aren’t in the labor force or are unemployed. It’s true that the unemployment rate is higher among black youth than among whites and  . Still, this figure seems high because many      Americans (of any race) aren’t in the labor force (for example, because they’re in school). Around 49 percent of African American youth aren’t in the labor force, by these data, compared to around 45 percent of all     .  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] One in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. Not a single member of a household. These are the real unemployment numbers  —   the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.  [Earlier in the speech, Trump used Labor Department measures of unemployment for Detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. His son, Donald Jr. has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. PolitiFact gave that claim a ”pants on fire” rating.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] [Aside from that, it’s true that the current unemployment figure  —   4. 9 percent  —   is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. In fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the Labor Department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. However, that doesn’t make the headline unemployment rate a ”hoax.” As for the 1 in 5 figure, Trump is working off of a BLS report that found that 19. 7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. That’s different from ”in the labor force,” and it’s also an incomplete measure  —   the Labor Department’s definition of family would include retired couples, for example.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4, 000 think of that, $4, 000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. The average worker today pays 31. 5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. Very grim picture. The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It’s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and in many states, it’s much higher than that. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America  —   but let them ship products into the United States   if they move overseas. This, ladies and gentlemen, is backwards, it’s backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. In other words, we’re reducing your taxes from 35% to 15%. [While the federal corporate tax rate is 35% the Congressional Research Service found in 2014 that the average effective corporate tax rate was around 27% and the Government Accountability Office calculated in 2010 that profitable businesses were paying federal income taxes amounting to about 13% of their total global income.  —  Arnie Seipel] [Independent budget analysts have raised concerns that the 15% business rate would cause many people to quit their jobs and become independent contractors to pay lower taxes. This could cut into revenues severely.   Keith] Thank you. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton’s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won’t be able to start  —   you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. We’re going to end it. I am going to cut regulations massively massively. Our lower business tax will also end   corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country  —   and by the way into cities like right here in Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than    income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. [Tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy Americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. Lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn’t be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. Trump’s campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: ”Mr. Trump’s plan would better help struggling families. Current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. The deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. We provide credit to    caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. To provide benefits to   taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes —  increasing their paycheck income each week. ”  —   Trump campaign, The campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks.  —  Tamara Keith] We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that are now parked overseas they can’t bring their money back into our country. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying only a 10 percent tax. This money will be   in states like Michigan, states like Michigan which are having serious problems. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death  —   it’s just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it. [The death tax, or estate tax, applies this year to estates with combined assets exceeding $5. 45 million.  —   Peter Overby ] [That applies to very few people  —   around 1 in 500 estates were subject to the tax last year, according to the Tax Policy Center.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Next comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want t jobs and I want wealth to stay in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world. The U. S. economy today is   percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current   is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year  —   that’s money taken straight out of cities like Detroit. So many of our cities are suffering so gravely, right out of Detroit and others. The federal register is now over 80, 000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2, 000 new regulations  —   each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down, and that’s what it’s doing   it’s dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, and by the way, a great guy, signed a similar order when he became and when he worked so hard in Indiana as its governor. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring new jobs, and expanding their businesses. So important. That’s what it’s about. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill many many jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated quickly. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. We don’t win anymore. But when I am president, we will start winning again, big league. One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We’ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We’ve seen it in Iran. We’ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in   cash as a ransom payment. [Trump is referring to the $400 million dollars flown to the Iranian government by the Obama administration in January, at the same time American prisoners were released from Iran. The money was part of a settlement of a   legal dispute, involving military sales before the Shah was overthrown in 1979. The State Department said it is ”completely false” to say it was a ransom payment, though it coincided with the release of American prisoners. The payment was made in foreign currencies because it’s illegal to conduct a transaction with Iran in U. S. dollars under current law.  —  Arnie Seipel] But we’ve also seen the terrible   judgment right here for everybody to see in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA, she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported   trade deal and that was a really bad one with South Korea, and she supports the   Partnership. Not now, but very soon if she wins and we can’t let her win. Cause that will be a disaster for Detroit and everybody else. Let’s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual   experts who’ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion  —   resulting in some 70, 000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton’s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70, 000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100, 000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven’t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion  —   more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. What else is new? It’s happening with everyone. The next betrayal will be the   Partnership. Hillary Clinton’s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have been saying, and this is from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. As sure as you’re sitting there. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP  —   and it’s also a vote for NAFTA. [Clinton and Trump alike are in favor of renegotiating NAFTA, as the Washington Post’s Fact Checker reports.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben]  Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost $60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285, 000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160, 000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton’s apology. She has been a disaster. Obama has been a disaster. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33, 000 emails she deleted. Hillary Clinton’s   Partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry, believe me, even bigger and even worse than NAFTA. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U. S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member, all of the member countries has cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in the year 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740, 000 manufacturing jobs. What are we doing? Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. It will be catastrophic. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from TPP. She is bought, controlled and   by her donors and special interests. One hundred percent. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed   plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, big problem, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA, which is a disaster for our country. A total renegotiation. If we don’t get a better deal, we will walk away. At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our country. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U. S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States. Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and   trade deals are. Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The   Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their   regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions   power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The   war on coal has cost Michigan over 50, 000 jobs. [According to a study in Energy Policy, the coal industry lost about 50, 000 jobs nationally between 2008 and 2012. Another study by the Energy Information Administration suggests that the rise of cheap natural gas has impacted the coal industry  —   Jonquilyn Hill] Hillary Clinton says her plan will ”put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.” We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama’s   energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the   energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2. 5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7, 000 dollars per person. A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500, 000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering   relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.  [In a footnote to the speech, Trump pointed to a December 2015 CBO working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million    workers than it would be without Obamacare  —   meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million FTE workers. However, that’s not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the U. S. economy: ”Some people would choose to work fewer hours others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,” the CBO reported. In other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide  —   saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country. We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve. Detroit  —   the Motor City  —   will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday  —   who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday. There will be no change under Hillary Clinton  —   only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy   mined from American sources   that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. [This is a frequent campaign promise from Trump, but his own hiring practices haven’t always reflected this view. A recent Buzzfeed article detailed Trump’s effort to bring in foreign guest workers for his    resort. When asked about this, Trump has said it is hard to get enough American workers for these seasonal jobs.   Keith]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can’t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America. Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn’t be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is Back  —   Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before. Thank you, and God Bless You."
"Editor’s note: NPR   Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s economic speech on Monday.  Trump delivered an address Monday to the Detroit Economic Club, outlining a plan to cut taxes and get rid of regulations. Today was Hillary Clinton’s turn, where she argued that her plan would boost the middle class while Trump’s plan ”would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers.” Clinton spoke at Futuramic Tool  Engineering, an advanced manufacturing facility in Warren, Mich. Clinton has been talking about her jobs plan for weeks now, visiting factories and small business. Her address was meant as a contrast to Trump’s dark vision of the state of American manufacturing and focus on coal and steel, industries that have been in steep decline for more than a generation. As she’s talked about the economy, Clinton has faced a couple of challenges convincing white working class voters that she feels their pain and condensing her five point economic plan into something simple, catchy and satisfying. She spent much of the speech drawing out contrasts with Trump, portraying them as unrealistic and destructive, while describing her own proposals. Clinton also debuted a new attack on Trump’s tax plan saying it includes a ”Trump Loophole” designed to benefit his businesses and cut his own personal tax burden. Trump’s actual personal tax burden is unknown because he has broken with the   tradition of presidential candidates and hasn’t yet released his tax returns for public review. A source close to Clinton says she will be releasing her 2015 tax returns in the coming days (all of her tax returns dating back to the 1970s have been released to the public) and her running mate Tim Kaine will be releasing ten years of his family’s tax returns as well. This is intended to put additional pressure on Trump, who has said he won’t release his taxes while they are under audit, something he claims is ongoing. Thank you. Thank you so much. I have to tell you, I am thrilled to be here for a number of reasons. First, it’s wonderful to be back in Michigan. You can really feel the energy and dynamism that is driving this state’s comeback. [The unemployment rate in Michigan peaked in June 2009 at a stunning 14. 9 percent and has been falling essentially ever since. Unemployment in the state as of June 2016 was 4. 6 percent, though that is a preliminary reading.   Keith] And, in Detroit, we’ve got new businesses opening, neighborhoods like Midtown and Eastern Market are coming back, the auto industry just had its best year ever. [By the measure of new cars purchased, 2015, was in fact a banner year. Take this headline from Car And Driver: Boom! ”We Look Back at 2015 U. S. Auto Sales, the Best Year Ever.” The article credits the improved economy.   Keith] Over in Ann Arbor, high tech firms are thriving, the next generation of engineers are getting trained up in Houghton and here at Futuramic, so well named, you are on the front lines of what I believe will be a true manufacturing renaissance in America. I just was given a short but exciting tour by Mark Jurcak and John Couch, who were telling me about how this company, what started as and for most of its early history, was an auto supply company. And then in 2000 as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, they were faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don’t we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We’ve got to just fold up. Let’s, you know, just kind of quit. But that’s not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. You are in now what is largely an aerospace company, and because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of Futuramic, you are seeing the future unfold. So, I got to see what’s happening here to help build the SLS rocket, that is going to go from Macomb to Mars. I saw the two halves of an F35 nose cone waiting to be put together. I talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work. And what I believe with all my heart is that what’s happening here, can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. We are builders and we need to get back to building. [This is a key part of Clinton’s economic message. She talks regularly about advanced manufacturing, visiting factories around the country to promote the idea that although American manufacturing won’t return to what it once was, it could be something new, more efficient and innovative. This is quite a contrast with Trump’s pledge to reopen steel mills that were shuttered a generation ago and bring the coal industry back to what it once was.   Keith] So we’re making progress. None of us can be satisfied until the economic revitalization we’re seeing in some parts of Michigan reaches every community but it is inspiring to see this combination of old fashioned hard work and cutting edge innovation. And I know my opponent in this election was here in Michigan about a week ago and it was like he was in a different place. When he visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime. He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great. And the same is true when it comes to our country. He describes America as an embarrassment. He said and I quote, ’We’re becoming a third world country.’ Look around you my friends. Go visit with the workers building rockets. That doesn’t happen in third world countries! [Nigeria, India, Iran, Ukraine, and Algeria are developing nations with space programs.  —   Jonquilyn Hill] Now we have a lot of urgent and important work to do and that’s what I’m going to talk about today. Because all of the people that I have met throughout this campaign, really prove how wrong this negative, pessimistic view is. America’s best days are still ahead of us if we make up our minds to actually go out and make that happen. Just consider our assets. We have the most dynamic, productive workforce in the world, bar none. We have the most innovative businesses, the top colleges, universities, community colleges, training programs in the world. And the best science and technology. We have enormous capacity for clean energy production. We are resilient, determined, hardworking   there is nothing America can’t do if we do it together. And I know this because this is how I was raised. And I don’t think Mr. Trump understands any of it. He hasn’t offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face. Now, those challenges emerged long before the great recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There’s too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today. But there are common sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don’t we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress. And how can you not be frustrated, and even angry, when you see nothing getting done? And a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back. And that is not how it’s supposed to be in America. If I am fortunate enough to be your President, I will have your back every single day that I serve. And my mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. This is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class. I was born in Chicago. I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for fifty years. And because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college, and eventually start his own small business  —   and send me off into the world to follow my dreams. No matter how far those dreams have taken me, I’ve always remembered that I’m the daughter of a   owner and the granddaughter of a factory worker  —   and proud of both. So here’s what I want. I want every American family to be able to tell the same story. If you work hard. You do your part, you should be able to give your children all the opportunities they deserve. That is the basic bargain of America. Now, whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the 21st century depends, in large measure, on the outcome of this election. So here are four questions that I hope the American people will ask of both candidates  —   and that the answers should help make your choice in November crystal clear: First, which candidate has a real plan to create   jobs? Second, who will restore fairness to our economy and ensure that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes? Third, who will really go to bat for working families? And, fourth, who can bring people together to deliver results that will make a difference in your lives? Now, I hope that after giving a fair hearing to both sides, you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign  —   not just Democrats, but a growing number of Republicans and Independents as well. [This week Clinton’s campaign launched an initiative called Together For America, designed to reach out to Republicans and Independents who could be persuaded to vote for her. But it’s unlikely she will be swaying them on policy. She hasn’t moderated her positions at all since the primary. Instead she and her campaign seem to be making a pitch based largely on temperament and values, not on taxes, college affordability or health care policy. One Republican I interviewed who is supporting Clinton over Trump said ”You have to have a hierarchy of principles at a time like this.” And in 2016, tax policy has moved down on his priorities list.   Keith] Now, when it comes to creating jobs, I would argue it’s not even close. Even conservative experts say Trump’s agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain, [Clinton is referring to Mark Zandi here, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. She has brought up the Zandi connection on multiple occasions. Zandi was listed among McCain’s advisors on his 2008 campaign, but Zandi also advised the Obama administration on its stimulus package, as the Wall Street Journal reported this year. A search on OpenSecrets. org finds that he contributed to John McCain, but also to several Democrats over the years  —   including Hillary Clinton last year. All of which is to say that while solely linking him to McCain might imply that he’s a conservative economist, that would be misleading.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] if you add up all of Trump’s ideas  —   from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with China to deporting millions of   immigrants  —   the result would be a loss of 3. 4 million jobs. [This Moody’s report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump’s policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U. S. would lose 3. 4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers ”false precision,” as the Upshot’s Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain  —   the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, ”involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.”  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] By contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs. [This Moody’s report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump’s policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U. S. would lose 3. 4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers ”false precision,” as the Upshot’s Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain  —   the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, ”involve some guesswork and are at least debatable.” (Meaning the same would be true of the assumptions underlying the report on Clinton’s policies  —   see below.)  —   Danielle Kurtzleben]  So let me tell you how we would do it. I believe every American willing to work hard should be able to find a job that provides dignity, pride, and decent pay that can support a family. So starting on Day One, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new,   jobs since World War II. We will put Americans to work building and modernizing our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our railways, our ports, our airports. We are way overdue for this, my friends. [Spending on infrastructure is one area where Clinton and Trump agree. She has proposed spending $275 billion over five years on infrastructure. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would double Clinton’s spending on infrastructure  —   that’s a big change from the usual Republican economic thinking, as the Wall Street Journal’s Michelle Hackman wrote, as it could mean a significantly bigger deficit.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We are living off the investments that were made by our parents and grandparents’ generations. We will also help cities like Detroit and Flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity, expanding affordable housing, and repair schools and failing water systems as well. You know, I happen to think we should be ambitious. While we’re at it, let’s connect every household to broadband by the year 2020. It’s astonishing to me how many places in America not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don’t have access to broadband. And that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the Internet 5 million of them live in homes without access to the Internet. So you talk about an achievement gap, it starts right there. And let’s build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It’s probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it, which will help to grow our economy.  [Bringing jobs back from overseas is a major theme of Trump’s campaign that has resonated with many voters around the country. On the issue of energy, Trump primarily focuses on reviving older energy sources like coal and promoting fracking, though he has talked about advocating ”clean coal” technology. An analysis by Scientific American found that Trump’s promise to bring back closed coal mines would be difficult to fulfill, both because of environmental regulations and economic shifts   McCammon] And here’s something you don’t always hear enough from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. And we’re going to invest $10 billion in ”Make it in America” partnerships to support American manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries. When Mark and John were giving me the tour and I was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at Futuramic, what I hear all over the country   Germany, Japan, Italy   I want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the United States. There is no reason we can’t begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else. Let’s also expand incentives like the New Market Tax Credits that can bring businesses, government, and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind. From neglected neighborhoods in Detroit and Flint to Logging Country, Coal Country, and Native American communities. From rural areas ravaged by addiction and lost jobs to industrial regions hollowed out when factories closed. As president, I will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs. With new national initiatives to cut red tape at every level and expand access to credit, especially through community banks and credit unions. I will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses. Right now, the smallest businesses, the kind that my dad had, cause it was a really small business, spend 20 times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to their larger companies. It should be as easy as printing out a bank statement. [This stat comes from 2015 congressional testimony from Tax Analysts Chief Economist Martin A. Sullivan, who found that firms that employ 1 to 5 people spend $1, 101 per employee on federal tax compliance, compared to $51 per employee at businesses that have 50 or more employees. In ”Her Way,” authors Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta write about Hugh Rodham’s small business, saying that only ”when his two sons were old enough to pitch in on the occasional Saturday, did he get help.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] Let’s free entrepreneurs to do what they do best  —   innovate, grow, and hire. As Mark said, this company started because of a drive down a road, and thinking about it, talking about it, then seeing one of the old Oldsmobile futuramics and deciding, hey not only do I have an idea, I have a name. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. And we’re going to get back to doing that. Now, Donald Trump has a different view.  He’s made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas. There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills. A lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn’t because Trump couldn’t pay them, it was because he wouldn’t pay them.  [A USA Today investigation found hundreds of people who accuse Trump of failing to pay them for their work. According to USA Today, Trump has put the blame on contractors he hired as   and has said that the events described happened long ago. The Wall Street Journal has done similar reporting.   Sarah McCammon] And that’s why I take it personally. My dad ran a printing plant. He had two really long tables. He printed fabric for draperies. He would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen and he would go down the table, he’d put the silkscreen down, he’d pour the paint in, he’d take the squeegee, he’d go across the screen, he’d lift it up, he’d go down all the way to the end and then he’d start on the other table. He worked hard. And then when he finished, he would load all that fabric up, put it in his car, and take it to the business that had ordered it   maybe a restaurant, or a hotel or some office. He expected to be paid when he showed up. He did the work. He paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs. He expected to be paid. I can’t imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had gotten a contract from Trump. And showing up and submitting his bill had been told we’re not going to pay and if you don’t like it, sue us. My father never could have sued a big organization like that. I just don’t understand it. I’ve met all kinds of workers, painters, plumbers. I’ve met small businesses that provided pianos, installed glass or marble, all of whom were denied payment and after going back time and again being told, well maybe we’ll pay thirty cents on the dollar or fifty cents on the dollar. That’s not how we do business in America. So we’ve got to create more good jobs that are going to help more people. For example, our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices and greater flexibility. But we need to do more to empower the workers in our service sector too. The people taking care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement. And, it’s crucial that every American have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future. So we will fight to make college   for the middle class and   for everyone. [This is a relatively new position for Clinton. For much of the primary, Clinton’s plan was for ”debt free college.” Then after the voting was done as part of negotiations with the Bernie Sanders campaign, Clinton agreed to expand her proposal to make public universities tuition free for middle class and low income students.   Keith] We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford. It’s not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can’t refinance theirs. And here’s something neither party talks about enough: a   degree shouldn’t be the only path to a good job. You should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and make a good living doing it. So many Americans have the talent and the will to succeed  —   whether they’re kids right out of high school or older people displaced by automation and outsourcing. For too long, big promises about the power of training and retraining haven’t delivered like they should. It doesn’t help anyone to be trained for a job that doesn’t exist. So we’ll support   union training programs, propose new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn, and do more to dignify skills training across the board  —   for welders, machinists, health technicians, and so many other fields. I’m sure some of you are thinking, that all sounds good. But what about trade? After all, Trump talks about it all the time. Well, let’s start with this: It’s true that too often, past trade deals have been sold to the American people with rosy scenarios that didn’t pan out. Those promises now ring hollow in many communities across Michigan and our country that have seen factories close and jobs disappear. Too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States. It’s also true that China and other countries have gamed the system for too long. Enforcement  —   especially during the Bush administration  —   has been too lax. Investments at home that would make us more competitive have been blocked. And American workers and communities have paid the price. But the answer is not to rant and rave  —   or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages  —   including the   Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president. [This is Clinton’s strongest language yet about the trade deal she called a ”gold standard” when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. At the time, the trade pact was in the early stages of negotiations. For the first several months of her campaign, Clinton resisted taking a position on TPP, saying the deal was still being negotiated. She finally weighed in last October, a week before the first Democratic debate, saying she couldn’t support it in its current form. Many progressives are suspicious that, like President Obama did, she would soften her opposition to the trade deal if she is elected. Donald Trump has also charged that Clinton fully intends to sign off on TPP if she is president. Clinton has held firm in her opposition, but in an interview a close political ally of hers seemed to confirm the suspicions, saying she would likely implement it as president. The campaign moved immediately to tamp that down and Clinton in this speech was unequivocal  —   perhaps because she had to be.   Keith] As a Senator, I fought to defend New York’s manufacturers and   from unfair Chinese trading practices. And I opposed the only multilateral trade deal that came before the Senate while I was there, because it didn’t meet my high bar.  [Clinton voted against the multilateral Trade Act of 2002. However, she did vote in favor of six bilateral trade agreements during her her tenure as a U. S. Senator.  —   Jonquilyn Hill] As Secretary of State, I fought hard for American businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property. As President, I’ll stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take advantage of American workers and companies. I’m going to ramp up enforcement by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor, tripling the number of enforcement officers, and when countries break the rules, we won’t hesitate to impose targeted tariffs. And Trump? He may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength. Fear that we can’t compete with the rest of the world even when the rules are fair. Fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls. If Team USA was as fearful as Trump, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles [   ] would be cowering in the locker room. Instead, they’re winning gold medals. Because America isn’t afraid to compete. Right now, thousands of Michigan companies are exporting billions of dollars of products around the world. We want them to sell even more  —   and create more jobs here at home. But corporations shouldn’t abandon profitable operations here to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus, and unions a weaker hand to play. Now, before he tweets about how he’s really one who’ll put ”America First” in trade, let’s remember where Trump makes many of his own products. Because it’s sure not America. He’s made Trump ties in China and Trump suits in Mexico instead of here in Michigan.  [Trump says he manufactures products outside the United States because he’s a businessman and that’s the best way to compete in the current marketplace. What’s unclear, as conservative and liberal observers have pointed out, is what policies Trump would propose to change the current market dynamics to encourage textile production in the U. S.   McCammon] He keeps saying it’s not possible to make these things in America anymore. That’s just wrong. We created a website  —   hillaryclinton.     —   with a list of a hundred places across the United States already producing similar goods. One positive thing Trump could do to make America great again is to actually make great things in America again. Now, let’s look at the second question: which candidate will fight for fairness? This is an urgent need. The tide isn’t rising fast enough, and it’s certainly not lifting all boats. Since the crash, too many of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent. The rules and incentives of our economy reward corporations for putting   stock prices above   investments in workers, equipment, and research. While corporate profits are at   highs, paychecks for most people have barely budged. Incomes aren’t growing fast enough to keep up with costs like prescription drugs and child care. I believe that every employee, from the CEO suite to the factory floor, contributes to a business’ success, so everybody should share in the rewards  —   especially those putting in long hours for little pay. So I’m proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with workers. More broadly, we will fight for a more progressive, more patriotic tax code that puts American jobs first. Right now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We should stop that, and instead make them give back tax breaks they received here at home. For those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they should pay a new exit tax. And Wall Street, corporations, and the   should finally pay their fair share of taxes. I support the Buffett Rule, because   should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. We should also add a new tax on  . .. crack down on tax gaming by corporations. .. and close the carried interest loophole  —   something I’ve been calling for years. What does Trump say? There’s a myth out there that he’ll stick it to the rich and powerful because, at heart, he’s really on the side of the little guy. Don’t believe it. Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable. ..when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink. .. and let insurance companies write their own rules again. Trump would roll back tough rules on the financial industry. I’ll do the opposite  —   we should strengthen those rules so that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again! Trump even wants to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has already returned more than $11 billion to 25 million Americans. Why would you get rid of that? Then there’s Trump’s tax plan. He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt and lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection. In his speech on Monday, he called for a new tax loophole  —   let’s call it the ”Trump Loophole.” It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies. He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families. One nonpartisan expert at the Tax Policy Center described this plan as, quote, ”a really nice deal”. .. for Donald Trump. Of course, it’s hard to say how nice, because he refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns. But we do know that the 400 richest taxpayers in America would get an average tax cut of more than $15 million a year from this loophole. Then there’s the Estate Tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether. If you believe that he’s as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99. 8 percent of Americans. Let me repeat that: the Trump family gets a $4 billion tax cut. .. and 99. 8 percent of Americans get nothing. Just think about what we could do with those $4 billion dollars. We could pay for more than 47, 000 veterans to get a   college degree. [That’s about right, so long as not every veteran chooses to go to a public school outside their state. In the   school year, the cost of   tuition and fees for one year at   public colleges   the GI Bill won’t pay for private colleges   was just over $9, 000. Multiply that by four years and you get $36, 000. Multiply that by 47, 000 and you get about $1. 7 billion   well under Clinton’s estimate. But    tuition was just under $24, 000 per year. Do the same math and you’ll end up at $4. 5 billion, slightly over Clinton’s estimate.   Meg Anderson] We could provide a year’s worth of health care to nearly 3 million kids.  [The Children’s Health Insurance Program insures more than 8 million children annually and costs more than $13 billion. Insuring 3 million more kids represents an increase of about 37 percent. When you factor that increase into the cost, you’ll see an increase slightly under $5 billion  —   which is probably what makes the word ”nearly” important in this claim.   Meg Anderson] Or fund about a year’s worth of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement. That’s a better way to spend the money. On Monday, I’m going to be in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Vice President Biden. He has a saying: ”Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.” Well, Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest in our veterans, our kids, and our police officers. You can judge for yourself about our values. Now, it’s true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families. As usual, he’s making big promises. But, his advisors have said that he may not stand by them. Instead, the tax cuts he doubled down on in his speech on Monday offer trillions to the richest Americans and corporations. One of the differences between Donald Trump and me is that I’ll stand by my plans. So this is another case of the old saying that ”if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” This brings us to the third question: Which candidate can you actually count on to go to bat for workers and working families? It’s not enough to pay lip service to being on your side. We have to recognize how Americans actually live and work in the 21st century  —   and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier. We know that women are now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families. And more Americans are cobbling together part time work, or striking out on their own. So we have to make it easier to be good workers, good parents, and good caregivers, all at the same time. That’s why I’ve set out a bold vision to make quality, affordable childcare available to all Americans and limit costs to 10 percent of family income. On Monday, Trump offered his first real ideas on this topic. Previously, he dismissed concerns about childcare. He said it was, quote, ”not an expensive thing” because you just need some blocks and you need some swings. Now he says he wants to exclude childcare payments from taxation. But his plan was panned left, right, and center  —   because it’s transparently designed for rich people. He would give wealthy families 30 or 40 cents on the dollar for their nannies, and little or nothing for millions of   families trying to afford childcare so they can get to work and keep the job. [Trump’s proposed income tax deduction on the average cost of childcare was criticized for likely being more of a help to   families than to many   families. However, the Trump campaign has also said that it will allow   families to deduct the cost of childcare from their payroll taxes. The campaign says it will offer more details in coming weeks on their childcare plans.  —   Danielle Kurtzleben] We can do better. We should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children  —   the same families Donald Trump’s plan largely ignores. This is just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit. For example, guaranteeing equal pay won’t just increase paychecks for women  —   it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board. Yet for some reason, Trump’s against it. Paid family leave won’t only make life easier for moms and dads  —   it will also keep skilled, talented Americans in the workforce and grow our economy. That’s why every other advanced economy already offers it. But again, Trump’s against it. [There are no federal legal requirements for paid family leave in the U. S. and among OECD countries, the United States is the only country that doesn’t offer paid maternity leave. Some states have their own paid leave laws and most U. S. workers are covered by the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows for up to 12 weeks of leave annually, albeit unpaid.   Meg Anderson] Raising the federal minimum wage won’t just put more money in the pocket of   families  —   it also means they spend more money at the businesses in their neighborhoods. Trump’s against that as well. Expanding Social Security won’t just help older Americans retire with dignity  —   it will ease burdens on families and communities. Passing comprehensive immigration reform won’t just help keep   families together  —   it will grow our entire economy. And finally, strengthening unions doesn’t just serve members  —   it leads to better pay, and benefits, and working conditions for all employees.  [A large body of academic research suggests that labor unions do raise the overall level of wages and benefits in the economy. An influential 2011 research paper found that declines in union membership since 1973 accounted for a third of the increase in wage inequality for male workers and a fifth of the increase in wage inequality for female workers.   Neely] And giving Americans in every state the choice of a   health insurance plan won’t just help those who struggle to afford coverage  —   it will strengthen competition and drive down costs for everyone. These are all causes I’ve worked on for decades. I believe they point to a fundamental truth about our economy. It may seem   when you’re competing for a job, a promotion, or a contract  —   someone wins and someone loses. But that’s not the full picture. If you step back, you’ll see that we really are all in this together. If we grow together, we can all rise together. Because we’re stronger together. And that’s why the fourth question is key: Who can bring people together to get any of this done? What we need is serious, steady leadership that can find common ground and build on it based on hard but respectful bargaining. Leadership that rises above personal attacks and name calling, not revels in it. Donald Trump insults, shouts down, and bullies his opponents. He can’t even play nice with his friends. I know it’s hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together. I know because I did it as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. It’s how we created the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers 8 million kids, rebuilt New York after   and passed a treaty reducing the threat from Russia’s nuclear weapons. So I am convinced we can work together again. One of the reasons I asked Tim Kaine to be my running mate is that he has a record of working across the aisle to get things done, as a mayor, governor, and now Senator. Together, we’ll make full use of the White House’s power to convene. We’ll get everyone at the table  —   not just Republicans and Democrats, but business and labor leaders. .. academics and experts. .. and, most importantly, all of you. I want working people to have a real say in your government again. That means we have to get unaccountable money out of our politics, overturn Citizens United, and expand voting rights, not restrict them. Starting even before the election, we will bring together leaders from across our economy and our communities for meetings on jobs, American competitiveness, and working families. We all need to pull together and give our country the best chance to succeed. The bottom line is this: I’m running for president to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. Donald Trump wants America to work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else. He’s offered no credible plans to address what working families are up against today. Nothing on student loans or the cost of prescription drugs. Nothing for farmers and struggling rural communities looking to build a new future with clean energy and advanced agriculture. Nothing for communities of color in our cities to overcome barriers of systemic racism and create new opportunities for young people. All he does offer is an even more extreme version of the failed theory of   economics, with the addition of his own unique Trumpian spin  —   outlandish ideas that even many Republicans reject. Trump may believe that he ”alone can fix” our country. Clearly, he doesn’t know the people of Michigan. He doesn’t see businesses, labor unions, local government, clergy and community leaders coming together every single day to make things better. Yes, there is still a long road ahead, but Michigan is on the rise. And everyone is contributing. That’s America at its best. I hope you’ll stay active and engaged  —   working together to create jobs and build up your communities. .. working together to get out the vote and win in November. .. and working together after the election to press for the real progress we need. As your president, I’ll be your partner every step of the way. Because our nation needs every one of us to lend our energy, talents, and ambition to making America better. ”Stronger Together” is not just a slogan for our campaign. It’s a guiding principle for the future we’re going to build. And it’s the choice we’ve got to make this November  —   whether our country will work for everyone, or just for those at the top. Whether it’ll be a ”stronger together” economy where we all rise together, or an ”us versus them” economy where we all fight over a shrinking pie. I think the choice is clear. I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and big enough for everyone to share in its promise. So I’m asking for your support to help make that happen. Thank you very much."
"Over the weekend we asked Ann Powers and Jason King to wrestle with Frank Ocean’s     to 2012’s Channel Orange. They did so across many time zones and man hours what emerged is a conversation that stays   and grounded and ends in questioning both the artist and his audience. We find it impossible and personally limiting to consider this album outside of its context, so the below is as much a state of affairs as it is a   review. (Ann Powers and Jason King write about both the physical and digital versions of the album interchangeably. And without clarity regarding the whole listing vs. cover art spelling situation, we’re calling it Blonde throughout.) Ann Powers: When he began to put himself into the   that would inspire his new album Blonde, Frank Ocean imagined himself in a moving car. He was, in this waking dream, a girl. ”Two years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face,” the artist wrote in an essay posted on his Tumblr the day this weekend the album, four years in the making, finally became available.” A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head.” Ocean imagined himself wriggling against the seatbelt, he wrote, playing with its tension until it no longer constrained him. This feeling of freedom within containment, of traveling at a high speed on a course that is smooth and open  —   and of being comfortable with motion even in your most vulnerable, childlike moods  —   was the one that best fed the creativity he needed to complete an album as highly anticipated as any to come out this year, even though, since he relocated from California to the clogged streets of London, Ocean doesn’t even drive much any more. Ocean is a car enthusiast in real life. When he lived in Los Angeles, he owned three BMWs and was rebuilding a fourth. He populates his artistic world with references to Ferraris and Bugattis, the way many rappers do, but also to Acuras and Camrys, conduits to solitude, pleasure and escape for more average folk. In ”Nights,” one of the 17 circuitous, absorbing tracks on the digital version of Blonde, the New   Ocean remembers cruising in his family’s Honda before Katrina forced him out of the city. ”Kept at least six discs in the changer,” he recalls, rhyming in a   cadence over a woozy keyboard line. It’s easy to imagine that CD changer containing the music that drifts and melds within the    sound Ocean cultivates on Blonde: Stevie Wonder next to The Beatles next to Crescent City rappers and his mom’s Hammond   gospel favorites. In other songs, Ocean locates erotic pleasure within car interiors, and safety ”like an armored truck,” and even rebirth, when he finds the feathers of a mythical phoenix on his dashboard. (It must have been a Pontiac.) But ”Nights” places the sound of Blonde itself within that   space, connecting it to a process of listening and absorbing hours of source material which, though it might be shared with one or two fellow riders, is ultimately private and introspective, the quiet side of taking the open road. ”The stillness is the move,” goes the hook of a song by the Dirty Projectors, whose vocalist Amber Coffman is one of many guests from the cutting edges of various music scenes who appear on Blonde. The idea expressed in that phrase is fundamental to Ocean’s musical approach, even more so now than in his earlier work that challenged received ideas of both RB and indie pop. The rhythms on Blonde are cool, languid and minimal. Guitar and keyboard lines swell and brush against each other, rarely coalescing into hooks or stirring choruses. Some tracks are as dense as they are short, while others segment and land in structures that don’t conform to traditional songcraft at all. The stories he tells within these prismatic songs, many explicitly erotic, gain their power from the music’s tonal shifts and hard to track reference points. The lyrics only   them, though, and only in deep dialogue with music that carries the listener deeper into reflection. Introversion defines Ocean’s stance throughout Blonde, even when he’s reaching out to a lover those lovers are often merely shadows on the passenger seat anyway. One reason his music captures so many people’s imaginations now is that it’s supremely ruminative, dedicated to exploring how memories drift, dissolve, reassemble themselves to form the narratives that inwardly define us, and how desire arises within a story each person tells herself as she reaches toward another. ”Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought that could think of the dreamer in the thought,” Ocean rhymes in ”Seigfried,” imagining God at the end of that particular road, but not the lover for whom he longs. A guitar loop forms a membrane around the image, expanding it infinitely. When, moments later, he murmurs, ”I’d do anything for you” to the object of his longing, the feeling is peaceful, infusing heartache with mindfulness. This is what Ocean offers that listeners crave  —   an antidote to the industrious and cynical persona building that dominates so much of popular culture now a focus on process that feels so foreign to many listeners that they consider it a mystery. It’s not a mystery. It’s an articulation of what happens when each of us keeps her thoughts to herself. Jason King: So Blonde is the album that was formerly going to be known as Boys Don’t Cry (which has now become the name of a     magazine associated with the physical release of the album that you could, briefly, pick up in four   newsstands and a bookstore, in LA, New York, Evanston, Ill. and London). The original album title would have been especially fitting this week, as it so eerily resonates with the arresting photograph and accompanying video of    Omran Daqneesh, the baby from Aleppo who sat drenched in blood and dust and stunned into silence after rescue workers removed him from   rubble and propped him up in an emergency vehicle. Part of the reason that image has circulated so widely as a profound commentary on the horrors of the Syrian conflict is that Omran doesn’t cry in the face of such catastrophe instead, he looks like the oldest of old souls, and we find ourselves watching him work through unimaginable trauma in  . Indeed, we’re watching him while his life is splitting in two and tearing apart if he’s frazzled, or discombobulated, Omran is bravely keeping it inside, or he has no expression for what he’s feeling. Boys don’t cry, in part, because men refuse to cry: the toxic masculinity and weaponized lack of empathy that underwrite so many of our most pressing contemporary geopolitical conflicts are just two of the elements that have helped foment the incredibly tragic situation that Omran finds himself in. And so it’s fitting, given the times in which we live, that Frank Ocean has made a deeply empathetic and passionate album that’s partly about his own ongoing struggle with masculinity and emotionalism. Quilted from fragmented ideas, observations and submerged memories around the vicissitudes of heartbreak and loss, Ocean manages to process his relation to that personal trauma for us in the most intimate and fragile of ways. We’re listening to him work through some deeply personal moments, even if we don’t always know what the referents for those moments are. I can’t help but note that some of the most potent recordings this year made by black men  —   such as The Life of Pablo by Kanye West and Chance the Rapper’s mixtape Coloring Book  —   wade deeply, and even   into impressionistic emotionalism and into   questions of existence. And they offer us existential musings at a crucial time, when far too many people still can’t seem to figure out whether black lives matter enough to change their own. And yet nothing is ever so   or   with Ocean. His music, like his career as a whole, more often than not revolves around ambiguities and offhand non sequiturs. Apple Music lists the digital version as Blonde, as does the magazine page that serves as the physical’s gatefold, but the cover art reads Blond. Here, as on previous efforts, Ocean seems profoundly interested in identities that, for any number of reasons, have become torn apart (his own and those of the other characters he observes, too). He’s obsessed with people whose lives are split between past and present realities, people who move erotically between men and women, between warring ideals of masculine and feminine, and black and white, and gay and straight. This weekend alone, he released one audiovisual work and two different versions of the same album, and, though the two versions are not radically different from each other (there are five more tracks on the digital than the physical, but the physical includes two that aren’t on the digital) I think he wants us to know he goes both ways in all aspects of life. At the very least, he doesn’t subscribe to the idea of one thing or the other. To be fair, I’m also of two minds about Blonde: musically and sonically, it’s certainly consistent with today’s     and   pop, including Rihanna’s ANTI and Beyoncé’s Lemonade, as well James Blake’s The Colour in Anything and maybe even Banks’ forthcoming The Altar. But critics’ gleeful celebration these days of anything that registers as experimental ” ”  —   if that term ever even really suits the music  —   usually neglects to mention intrinsic flaws such as drifty songwriting that is too often formless and the pursuit of tone that is too often samey. It’s hard to be definitive about these critiques with Ocean’s newest releases. Taken together, Endless and Blonde were designed to flood the commercial marketplace in the late summer, and they’ve done so in a way that means  —   at least for journalists tasked with covering the musical and pop cultural moment  —   there’s really just too much complex music to digest well in such a compressed time. Both records could gain in their power and resonance as we have a chance to really dig in a bit more or their flaws may appear more pronounced in the absence of hype and four long years of expectation and anticipation. Ann Powers: Though Ocean is often romanticized as a mysterious figure and his music cast as   it’s perhaps more informative to think of Blonde as his way of revisiting and, in so doing, recasting the canon of classic rock. He’s been open about the influence of The Beatles, whose ”Here, There, and Everywhere” he quotes in the song ”White Ferrari,” and The Beach Boys, whose Brian Wilson almost enlisted him as a collaborator last year (although Wilson has said that didn’t work out because Ocean ”wanted to do rap”). Wilson’s influence is strong throughout Blonde, ringing through its lyrical melodies and ornate yet cleanly constructed arrangements. There’s also something very Brian about the way Ocean always seems to stand alone within his compositions, even though his list of collaborators numbers in the dozens. Frequently dwelling over states of dislocation and loneliness, Ocean’s songs touch a nerve similar to those that The Beach Boys’ sad auteur captured. When Wilson, as an adult, was making Smile, he called his grandiose,   songs ”a teenage symphony to God.” Parts of Blonde are more psychedelic than even Wilson’s more   efforts, exhibiting less craving for radio airplay. It could be called a teenage symphony to weed. Yet Ocean’s mind games never stray too far from his grounding in sensuality. This is something he shares with the Beatle I’d bet is his favorite, Paul McCartney, along with a wry sense of humor that shows itself in punny wordplay (boy, does Frank love   pairings like ”solo” and ”so low” or ”inhale and ”in hell”) and in colorful descriptions of street scenes and shady characters. Something essential in Ocean’s songs celebrates the pleasure of music itself. It feels so good when he lets his voice loose on an arching chorus or croons his way through a   verse, exhibiting the same kind of tunefulness that got Macca labeled ”the cute one.” Ocean’s cute bona fides are reinforced by other reference points: in the essence of Burt Bacharach that infuses his Beyoncé collaboration, ”Pink + White,” and the way he pays homage to Stevie Wonder paying homage to the     Carpenters in his attenuated but striking retake of ”Close To You.” Wonder is a crucial figure within Ocean’s realm of influence, another   emissary between musical genres whose experimentalism was tempered by a killer pop sense. With the inimitable run of joyfully   albums that began with 1972’s Music of My Mind, Wonder toppled the racist hierarchies that placed the efforts of white musicians like Wilson and The Beatles above those by the   ”entertainers” whose innovations had, in fact, provided the basis for all of rock. On his last album, Channel Orange, Ocean made the Wonder connections obvious, whereas here they’re more confined as he explores other palettes, including a host of guitar effects inspired by British bands like U2. (Brian Eno, who pioneered the ”infinite guitar” sound frequently invoked on Blonde, is listed in the album’s credits, though whether he worked on the recording or was merely sampled is unclear.) But Ocean continues to aim for that spirit of effortless artiness, and of experimentation grounded in pleasure and the pursuit of beauty, at the heart of Wonder’s work. Pleasure is one of Ocean’s main preoccupations. One way to listen to Blonde is as an album about sex: from the droll reference to masturbation that begins ”Solo,” to the lascivious   of ”Self Control” to the blatant descriptions that still come off as romantic in ”Skyline To,” Ocean embraces carnality as a treasure, sometimes frustrating because of its elusiveness but always worth pursuing. The frankness Ocean embraces is, of course, a central element of much American popular music and has been since the women who made the blues popular in the early 20th century spoke openly of the power, heat and sorrow in their own hips. In some ways, pop today is more explicit than ever   has considerably furthered the artistry of the   metaphor, and RB’s bedroom jams celebrate sexual satisfaction in no uncertain terms. (Rock has actually grown more prudish in recent years, tending toward a sort of chaste earnestness or the high   jokes of the Warped Tour.) Ocean connects with those histories in his work. Yet throughout Blonde, he tells stories of sexual connection and disconnection that take on a different character than is often evident in current pop. His very    strips away the posturing that demands sexuality be a public performance and reinstates a believable sense of intimacy. That Ocean’s own sexuality is, as he describes it, ”dynamic”  —   a quality he shares with many millennials and teens, who increasingly reject binary terms to describe both gender and desire  —   makes Blonde radical, not because he is anywhere near alone, but because he calmly insists that the listener embrace his view of pleasure as unexceptional, healthy, canonical. Jason King: Ann, although intimacy and interiority are clearly part of what’s compelling about Frank Ocean in 2016, he’s also defined by a profound exteriority  —   his   fondness for showbiz hype. There aren’t that many musicians left in 2016 who can conjure up Event Pop: in the ’80s, Michael Jackson turned every album release into a   cultural happening and more recently, entertainers like Beyoncé and Kanye West (and Radiohead, to a lesser degree) have carried the gloved one’s baton with aplomb. Ocean’s palette of tools, like enigma, teasing, misdirection and outright silence, may have ultimately managed to turn Blonde and Endless into cultural phenomena rather than just product. Even in the streaming music era, in which increasingly fewer listeners have any real need to digest albums as integral wholes, Ocean remains that rare musician who has never not been an album artist. It’s not just that he clearly knows how to put out albums with maximum fanfare, it’s that he knows how to make art with a capital A, aided and abetted by a   VIP list of collaborators on Blonde that includes Andre 3000, Tyler the Creator, Pharrell Williams and Endless’ Jonny Greenwood. Plus, the twisted,   images of the music video for ”Nikes” (directed by Tyrone Lebon) remind us that Ocean’s music can never be fully extracted from the visuals (his lyrics are already themselves cinematic). If Ocean weren’t making music, he’d probably be raking in bucks at an ad agency. On Blonde, Ocean continues to make music that’s an artistic distillation of   tristesse he’s got that in common with   millennial peers, everyone from album collaborator James Blake to Lena Dunham to The Weeknd. And even more than Channel Orange, Blonde  —   equal parts psychedelic indie rock,   electronica,           and   drifty    —  becomes an impressive showcase for Frank Ocean the creative producer. Those experimental, druggy sonics abound, showing up in the fried vocals and   on ”Nikes” to the ambient whistles in ”Solo” to the    delayed vocals on ”Pretty Sweet” to the scraping, backwards effects on ”Seigfried.” Blonde’s raw, bleeding, diaristic storytelling somehow makes me think about Sinead O’Connor, whose 1990 album I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got was one of the first to seamlessly merge RB, pop, rock and sampled   beats, in the context of confessional,    lyrics about relationships lost and existential interiority. I’d argue that more than 25 years later, Blonde takes root in the world Sinead made possible: its best songs are troubled relationship tunes that feel like ripped pages in a worn diary, and they’re often dark, moody and   sinister, like the work of David Lynch or Frank Miller. On ”Ivy,” Ocean writes breathlessly poetic lyrics: ”I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me   It started from nothing   I had no chance to prepare   I couldn’t see you coming.” And on tuneful ”Solo” he eloquently writes of ”A bull and a matador dueling in heaven   It’s hell on Earth and the city’s on fire   Inhale, inhale, that’s heaven.” Blonde also owes some debt to Meshell Ndegeocello, whose underappreciated 2000s albums like Cookie, Comfort Woman and Devil’s Halo directly laid ground for the eccentric fusion of experimental soul, pop, RB, rock and   we hear on Blonde. Like Ocean, Ndegeocello is black and queer, and raps and sings, and has always had an interest in alternative imaginings of masculinity in the context of   identities (the title of her outré 2007 album The World Has Made Me the Man of Our Dreams says it all). But bassist Meshell is known as a musician’s musician with technical chops, whereas Ocean comes by much of his conventional musicianship externally, via collaborators (when, as Ann mentioned, on ”Close to You,” he reworks Stevie Wonder vocoder samples and on ”White Ferrari,” as he interpolates The Beatles on ”Seigfried,” where he draws liberally on an Elliot Smith melody). You’ve noted that Ocean’s songs come to us as fragments and ideas that challenge the conventions of pop and RB, and yet he seems to have strayed very far from the tight slickness of songs like ”Novocaine” on Nostalgia, Ultra. I’m not sure whether that’s a step forward or backward. Certainly, anyone looking for Frank Ocean the strategic songsmith who once crafted a melodic nugget like ”I Miss You” for Queen B might find far too much of Blonde meandering or unhemmed. The challenge for me is less about songwriting, and more about the deliberate lack of groove that comes as a result of Blonde’s neglect of drums or basslines on songs like ”Skyline To.” To draw on that car metaphor, I want Blonde’s engine to rev up more often than it does, and I’m occasionally disappointed when it doesn’t. Ann Powers: Jason, you address crucial issues that are so often overlooked, especially today, when the symbolic gestures of identity and power that our pop stars enact are mistaken for actual heroism. Ocean has the potential to influence people’s views on love, sex, race and identity, and maybe the most   elements of Blonde will do so. Or, in the mainstream, he could just be another transient sensation. The helium atmosphere of sudden album releases and other highly engaging   makes it hard to know how this album’s impact will translate over time. Like a sullen millennial taking his most important college admissions test, Ocean answered years of hanging in the background with a weekend of   overachieving. Music fans and the media were stunned to attention, as you’ve noted, by fancy graphics and a poem about McDonald’s by Kanye West, confusing streaming options and the lines at those  . Will we still be listening to Blonde when the fall leaves turn? Only time will reveal its place in pop history. That lineage itself is changing no longer do artifacts like albums occupy its center. When an album does make a noticeable impact today, it’s because a community coalesces around it. That’s what happened with Lemonade, another collection of   songs that employed visuals to amplify its meanings and capture a larger audience than it likely would have as a mere musical release. Calling on a history book’s worth of   women’s expressive culture, Beyoncé’s very personal (or, at least, strategically confessional) account of a rocky period in a marriage was embraced as a monumental act of making lives visible and audible. ”Lemonade is Beyoncé’s intimate look into the multigenerational making and magic of black womanhood,” wrote Zandria F. Robinson in Rolling Stone. The superstar’s ability to connect her ”I” with that ”we” made not just a hit, but history. Ocean does not seem inclined to reach out in this way. His own visual album, as I said in our previous discussion of Endless, felt more like a   conceptual art piece. And you’re right about the songs on Blonde sparsely containing the elements that usually unite people behind a pop offering  —   most notably memorable beats. If the people can’t dance, will anyone be part of your revolution? Maybe Ocean doesn’t really care. If the most prominent voices besides his own on Blonde indicate anything, it’s that he’s chosen a peer group only marginally interested in cultivating renown. Andre 3000, a legendary rapper who’s repeatedly rejected the spotlight, claims the central cameo. Kendrick Lamar, whose recent success does demonstrate a strong sense of mission connected to fame, is present on one track, but mostly as a   generator. Ocean also relegates Beyoncé to background status in the last few bars of ”Pink + White.” It takes some chutzpah to put the Queen in that position. A more telling partnership is the one Ocean shares on ”White Ferrari” with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and James Blake, his bros in   anguish. Beyond the lyrical references to both tripping and getting naked, which are very Frank, the track could have been made by any of those three beloved artistes. Here’s where Ocean lives most comfortably right now, it seems: in the middle ground between high art and the arena, where a sympathetic audience will be patient with his musical wandering and lyrical obfuscations. Yet Ocean also still pledges fealty to the crew that first nurtured him, the   iconoclasts of Odd Future. The final track on Blonde is ”Futura Free,” a vocally distorted meditation on the tedium of success that concludes with a conversation, recorded long ago, with a couple of Ocean’s old pals from that milieu. (One is his brother, the other, the skateboarder Sage Elsasser.) The voices, just kids’ then, try to put a finger on their ambitions nobody can really articulate what he wants. ”How far is a light year?” someone asks. Ocean muddles this final question in noise. Is he ready to trace how far he’s come? For now, he seems content to just share his view of the ride. Jason King: Ocean’s interest in the choreography of interpersonal relationships, and his poetic approach to missed opportunities for connection  —   people coming together, getting together, drifting apart  —   is certainly part of the melancholic beauty of his music. He paints erotic desire in complex hues and colors when so many of his musical peers are still using Crayolas. We all know that in 2012, Ocean came out of the closet by refuting a    interpretation of his sexuality (and his lyrics) causing a seismic ripple in the default heteronormativity of   and RB. In retrospect, he helped spawn the   overground, creating space for the likes of queer,   and   artists ranging from Azealia Banks to Sam Smith and, yes, even Macklemore. Ann, as you note, Ocean has always approached sexual preference as fluid and dynamic, and he’s mostly performed being queer more as a casual, implicit reality than some sort of external public achievement. ”Good Guy” is a sketch of a song that appears to be the only explicit lyrical mention of same gender desire on Blonde. And even still, the narrative is broken in two: the first half is about a failed date at a gay bar, the second half is a conversation between two guys complaining about ”not having b****** no more.” Other songs (like ”Self Control,” ”Ivy” and ”Nights”) and sections of songs that deal with troubled love affairs specify no clear gender they could go either way. Perhaps much of the album is about failed   love perhaps it is not. (We also don’t really know yet to whom or what ”Seigfried” refers). Other songs like ”Nikes” make very specific reference to women (”these b****** want Nikes   they looking for a check”). While the promotion of sexual fluidity is rooted in allowing people to define sexuality away from conventions and binaries  —   though increasing research is demonstrating that sexuality is not quite as fluid a spectrum as Kinsey once argued  —   Ocean’s circumscribed discussions of explicit same sex desire could be frustrating, rather than liberating, for many within and outside of LGBTQ communities. In this light, Ann, Ocean’s car motifs continue to fascinate, but I can’t help also think that they are his main performative connection to a highly conventional symbol of machismo (which he, to his credit, acknowledges in his magazine when he says it might be linked to a ”deep, subconscious straight boy fantasy”). This is to say nothing of his continued evocation of   his lyrical use of invectives like ”n****” and ”b******” and   mention of the word ”p****”  —   all of which cosmologically connects him more closely to the PMRC sticker   tradition than to a sensual, retro RB one. I’ve written before that one of the reasons Ocean found widespread acceptance where other queer RB and pop artists have failed  —   beyond his evocation of rock tropes like the guitar and his tales of straight women in strip clubs  —   is because there’s a total absence of camp in his work. Moreover, in a song like ”Nikes,” he   felled influences like A$AP Yams and Pimp C (rest in peace) and even Trayvon Martin  —   but there’s no similar mention of slain LGB and trans folk (his emotional outpouring on Tumblr following the Orlando mass shooting doesn’t explicitly show up in his Blonde lyrics). I say this not to police what Frank Ocean can or should say, nor how he should say it  —   only to mention there is a long venerable tradition where queer artists (in or out of the closet) engage in   heteronormativity in the effort to avoid stigma and to fully crossover to straight audiences. It would be terribly tragic if Ocean’s minimal attention to these matters in his lyrics happened to follow suit in that tradition. I’ve recently been considering the idea that Napster helped create the reluctant pop star: so many musicians after 1999, in the absence of traditional record sales, found other ways to earn or bolster incomes, and found more stable lives to live. You see the evolution of the reluctant pop star today in the form of actor Donald Glover or golfer Justin Timberlake, where pop stardom is something you do on the side while you’re doing everything else. You also see it in the form of Sia or Zayn, where being a pop star (beyond making pop music) is simply a burden to be dealt with, or a way of life that you shuttle off to the corner, like the act of moving a mound of wasabi away from your sushi. Ocean seems to me the epitome of this millenia’s reluctant pop star  —   he’s a shrinking violet who went mostly invisible for the last four years he rarely shows up to public events and while he obviously knows how to write a solid   pop song, he’s become largely absorbed by other aesthetic pursuits. But the concept of the reluctant pop star has also merged into the concept of the silent pop star  —   that reclusive artist who rarely, if ever, does interviews, has highly controlled outgoing communications and practices withholding information from the public and press as a matter of course. Caginess and silence also happen to be the strategies of those of who know, or have known, something about living in closets. In that sense, it’s a bit of letdown that other than that    mention of Trayvon Martin in ”Nikes” (”RIP Trayvon, that n**** look just like me”) nothing on Blonde speaks explicitly to the #blacklivesmatter movement (though one could generously look the album as a whole as impressionistically arguing for the importance of black life). Nothing on Blonde addresses the extreme crisis that is happening right now in black LGBT communities where the CDC has found that one out of every two black men who has sex with men is projected to become infected with HIV. This crisis is not just limited to the U. S.: it connects with the devastating criminalization of homosexuality in African nations like Nigeria and Uganda and European countries like Russia, and to the unacceptable persecution and brutalization of LGBT communities by terrorist groups like ISIS. To be clear, I’m not making an argument that Ocean doesn’t think about such things or that his heart doesn’t bleed like everyone else’s. It’s also perfectly OK to not be a spokesperson or a role model or an activist, especially as pop and politics do not always make comfortable bedfellows. It’s OK, and even progressive in some ways, to pursue a more sophisticated   of what it means to be ”out” than the rigid binary model currently embraced by global pride movements. And yet, given that he’s released an album that’s so raw,   and intimate, and believing as of course I do that Frank Ocean does indeed cry over the real time, existential threats that surely inform his everyday life as a    black American man making mainstream pop music given his considerable platform in 2016, I have to ask where, years after hauntingly evocative tracks like ”Bad Religion,” is his will and courage  —   and maybe even his skill  —   to bring those    topical concerns into his recordings? Or does his crossover    —   as James Baldwin might put it, the price of the ticket  —   make the act of doing so simply out of his reach?"
"As presidential candidates travel the country, they often deliver the same speech, or close to it. We are annotating speeches delivered by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to give you a sense of what they are talking about regularly, and how they say it. To think about the structure of a Hillary Clinton stump speech, imagine a book shelf. Clinton probably has 50 books on the shelf, various elements of a speech, anecdotes, policies she talks about, themes, turns of phrase. For each speech she grabs a bunch of different books off the shelf. So, even if she gives three speeches at different events in the same day, they will be three totally different speeches, made up of things she says regularly. And she is constantly adding to the library, each time there is a development in the campaign, Donald Trump says something she wants to riff on or she gives a major policy speech. Here, we take a closer look at how a speech Clinton delivered on Sept. 6 in Tampa, Fla. lines up to her ”stump”: Hello, Tampa! Hello, USF! I know I’m only the second most exciting thing that’s happened here in the last few days. Your big win to open your football season got some attention. [Clinton always offers a little bit of local color at the top of her speeches, and sometimes as is the case later in this speech, she gets into a more in depth discussion of a policy matter related to the place she is speaking. For instance in New Hampshire she often talks about heroin and opioid addiction. In Philadelphia in April she cited crime statistics and talked about a shooting days earlier and in North Carolina and Wisconsin she talks about voting rights and voter ID laws.] But I am always happy to be at a university that is doing such a superb job in preparing the next generation of students. I had the great privilege of speaking to your president, Dr. Genshaft. Thank you. And I will talk in a minute about some of what I’ve learned about USF and why I think a lot of what you do here is a model for what we need to do in higher education. But for me it’s exciting to be here with so many friends. I want to start by thanking Mary Lent, who just introduced me. Air Force reservist, former commander of the 927th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, a woman who has served her country with honor and distinction. I would be proud to be her   . I want to thank your extraordinary mayor, Bob Buckhorn. Bob is an example of the kind of leader who gets things done by bringing people together, setting big goals and working to achieve them. That’s exactly what I want to do as president, and I look forward to working with Bob and the people of this great city and region. And that includes a longtime friend of mine, State Senator Arthenia Joyner. I have known Arthenia long before she was in elected office, but she’s always been an activist, always trying to make things better for people. I’ve known her for, oh, I hate to admit it, 25 years, and I am so grateful she is my friend. [One thing Clinton always does is thank dignitaries at the beginning of her speeches. Every politician does this, but she takes it to another level, talking about how she knows the people, thanking lower profile politicians like city council members and often thanking the young organizers working on her campaign in the local offices, by name.] This is the countdown to one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. No matter what your age, this is going to determine so much about your futures, the futures of our children and grandchildren. The stakes could not be higher. Everyone knows what an important state Florida is, and it’s not just because it’s always a   state it’s because Florida shows all of the excitement, the dynamism, the opportunities as well as the challenges and problems that we have to face together. So we have 62 days  —   62 days to make the case. And I can’t do it without you. And I’m here to lay out my case one more time and to ask for your help, because every single vote counts. Our campaign set a goal in July. We launched a drive to register three million Americans to vote this election. We have hosted thousands of events across the country, including right here in Florida. And today I’m asking every one of you to give us some of your precious time to be part of this campaign. And I’m going to run through some of the reasons why every single person here has a real stake in making sure our country heads into the future with confidence and optimism, that we truly are stronger together. [Stronger Together is Clinton’s campaign slogan, visible on signs all over her events. She uses the phrase multiple times with different meaning in virtually every speech.] Because that’s what will determine whether we have the economy that produces more good jobs with rising incomes whether we have an education system that prepares our young people for the jobs of the future whether college is affordable whether student debt can be paid back whether our health care system works whether we lead the world with strength and steadiness, working with allies and partners to make sure that we move toward peace and prosperity. There is an exciting, bold agenda before us, but it cannot be done by any one person. It must be done by all of us, and that is something that Donald Trump does not understand. Among the many troubling things that were said at his convention  —   and honestly, I sometimes didn’t recognize what country they were talking about. It was so dire, so dark, so divisive, so dangerous. But among the things he said was, ’I alone can fix it.’ Think of who that leaves out  —   our men and women in uniform, troops on the front line people like Mary who put on the uniform of the Air Force to serve our country. Think about the police and firefighters who rush toward danger. Think about those brave police officers and emergency responders in Orlando when the Pulse nightclub was attacked. Think about all the teachers, the educators, the professors, the staff who work to give young people a much better chance in the race of life. Think about all the hardworking people who can’t build a house by themselves, can’t erect one of Donald Trump’s skyscrapers by themselves. Think of all the small businesses that take a big chance  —   my dad was a small businessman. I know what a chance it is. He couldn’t do it alone. He needed customers. He needed suppliers. He needed workers. Americans don’t say, ’I alone can fix it.’ We say, ’We’ll fix it together, just watch us  —   nobody, nobody can solve problems better than we can.’ [Clinton added this section to her stump speech collection at another rally in Tampa, Fla. on the day after Donald Trump’s convention speech. It is a theme she now comes back to regularly. Notice the local touches throughout, mentioning the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando and shouting out to the woman who introduced her at the event.] And I want to be a president for all Americans, not some Americans  —   Democrats, Republicans, independents, every single American. I want to be the president for those who vote for me and those who vote against me because I want to bring our country together. I’m very proud that Tim Kaine and I are running a campaign of issues, not insults.  Because I believe anybody who is asking for your vote for the most important job not just in the country but in the world should tell you what they plan to do. I do have this  —   I guess it’s an   idea: If you’re going to ask people for their vote, they ought to have some idea what they’re voting for.  [Clinton talks frequently about her plans. She’s been rolling out policy papers, fact sheets and proposals since the very beginning of her campaign. Often in speeches, she talks about people mocking her for having so many plans, but she goes on to say the plans and details are important because these issues are important for people’s lives. If her campaign motto weren’t ”Stronger Together” it might well be ”Hillary Clinton: I have a lot of plans. ”] And I don’t think it’s enough to say, ’Oh, I’ll tell you later.’ I think it’s important to lay it out and to tell you how it’s going to be paid for. And that’s why starting today, especially for young people but really for everybody, we are putting out a book. It’s called ’Stronger Together.’ And in it, it shows this is more than a slogan for the campaign. This is a blueprint for America’s future. Among the things that we talk about is the core of our agenda, as laid out in this book. It is building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.  [This is a phrase Clinton has been using literally since the very first day of her campaign. It is the most consistent phrase in her speech.] We’re going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.  Infrastructure jobs like those here at the port. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, they need work and there are millions of jobs to be done. And in addition to what you can see, what about our water systems, our sewer systems? We need a new modern electric grid to be able to take in clean, renewable energy that can then move us toward that future we seek. [Although Clinton has a whole book full of policy proposals, in her speeches she tends not to get into great detail. They end up coming out in her speeches more like a big long list of ideas rather than details about exactly how they would work or how she would get there. In a way you could see her stump speech as a series of lists tied together by anecdotes.] I have a plan to install a half a billion solar panels by the end of my first term. And enough clean energy to power every home in America by the end of my second term. And I want young people especially to be part of this, to be in science, technology, engineering, manufacturing, creating this future that will determine the quality of your lives and the competitiveness of our economy. We also have to finish extending broadband access to every place in America. Right now, 70 percent of our teachers say that they assign homework to their students starting in elementary school that require the kids to learn how to use the internet. I think that’s great. We want to have an   population. But here’s the problem: five million homes where little kids live, where high school kids live, don’t have the internet. What does that mean? That means they’re already behind. It’s so unfair. We’re going to make this economy grow but we’re also going to make it fair. We’re going to have more advanced manufacturing jobs. I think we made a mistake years ago when we eliminated what used to be called vocational education. We’ve got to return technical education to our high schools, our community colleges. There are right now more than a million jobs that can be filled by people who are machinists, computer designers, tool and die makers. But for whatever reason they haven’t been given the chance to get that training. And maybe they’ve been told, you know what, the only future is to go to a great university like USF. Well, that is true for a lot of people, but it’s not true for everybody, and we need to make the hard work that builds America the kind of great work with respect and purpose that is going to attract a new generation. That’s why you’ll read what I want to do in here. [She’s holding up the book]  We’re going to try to make community college free. We’re also going to have apprenticeship programs. I’m going to give a tax credit to any company that is willing to pay a young person while that young person is learning the job at the same time. So infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy. We can do this. We are living off the investments that our parents and grandparents made. It’s time for us to step up and build America’s future. And let’s make it fair while we do that. That’s why I’ve said we’re going to emphasize the importance of small businesses. Right now small businesses are having a tough time in Florida and across America getting access to credit, right, and getting the kinds of regulations and overlapping expectations and standards that don’t really make sense. I want to make it clean and clear and I particularly want young people with an idea for a small business to feel that they can do it. So I have proposed a moratorium for three years on student debt so you can actually get a business off the ground, get it started, make your future. [In the first week of her campaign, Clinton met a recent college graduate with a ton of student debt who was operating and trying to buy a bowling alley. His student loan debt was making it really hard to get financing to purchase the bowling alley himself. Ever since then she has been talking about recent college graduates who want to start businesses and eventually her campaign developed a proposal related to that challenge.] I also believe we should raise the national minimum wage. Anybody working   should not be living in poverty. And finally, let’s guarantee equal pay for women’s work, which will raise family income. Anyone who’s willing to work hard should have enough money to raise a family. Did any of you watch any of the Democratic Convention? Well, I don’t know if you saw these two young people, 17 years old, from Kansas  —   young man, young woman, went to the same high school, about to be seniors, get a summer job working in a pizza restaurant in their home town. They’re pretty excited. I remember when I had what I thought of as my first real job. Not babysitting, not, you know, just kind of knocking around, but a real job where I had to actually show up someplace and get a paycheck. That was pretty exciting. So a young man, young woman were at our convention, and here’s the story they told. They were talking together one day after work. They’d known each other. And the young woman said, you know, I’m excited because I think I’m actually going to be able to save some money for college making $8 an hour. And her friend, the young man, looked at her, and he goes, I’m making $8. 15 an hour. And the young woman said, well, you didn’t have any experience before this job doing this, did you? He said, no. You know I didn’t. She said, well, what do you think happened? And the man said, oh, it must be a mistake. So they, together  —   and I give the young man a lot of credit  —   good guy, right? They go to tell the manager that there’s been a mistake. They’re doing exactly the same job, he’s making 15 cents more an hour. What happens? The manager fired them both. And, you know what? That’s legal. [The anecdotes change from location to location and often repeat, but Clinton regularly talks about people she’s met on the campaign trail, tying their story to one policy proposal or another.] If you find out about somebody else’s salary, even if you’re doing exactly the same job, you can be retaliated against, including being fired in most places. And so when I say, ’Let’s have equal pay,’ and some people I see looking quizzical at me  —   they say, well, of course you’ve got to have equal pay. Well, yeah, if you’re in the military, and the pay scale is set, or you’re in the government and it’s set, or you’re under a union contract and it’s set. But if you’re in the vast majority of jobs in America, you have no idea whether you’re being paid fairly. So we cannot let that continue. That’s wrong in America. If you’re doing the job, you deserve to get the pay. And so how are we going to fund this? I’ll tell you. We’re going where the money is. We’re going to the people who have made the money in the last 15 years. We’re going to the top 1, 10 percent, the millionaires, the billionaires. They’re going to have to start paying for supporting our military, supporting our education system, supporting our healthcare system. There could not be a bigger contrast between what I propose when it comes to taxes and what Donald Trump has proposed. He actually has proposed giving trillions  —   and I mean that with a T  —   trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, billionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would not only explode our national debt, it would lead to massive cuts in education and healthcare, and many of his proposals would really benefit his own family, but do nothing for the remaining 99 plus percent of Americans. And, in fact, independent analysts have said this: They’ve looked at our plans  —   he doesn’t have much in the way of plans, but they’ve looked at what he has said, and they’ve concluded, if we did what Trump is recommending, we would lose 3. 5 million jobs in four years. If we do what I’m recommending, we stand to gain over 10 million jobs in the next four years. [Throughout her speech, Clinton presents her own proposals in contrast with her opponent’s. She started talking about this research from Moody’s Analytics on her bus tour right after the Democratic convention, because that’s around the time the analysis came out. She chooses the most positive way to describe what the analysis says about her own plan.] And among the things that I want to do is make sure we have an education system from early childhood through adulthood, and that means I want universal   I want to help more kids get a better start, so that when they get kindergarten and first grade they’re ready to learn. [Clinton talks a lot about early childhood education, and has throughout her campaign. It’s something she has been working on one way or another since the beginning of her career, decades ago.] I want to work with our teachers and educators  —   I respect teachers and educators  —   and I want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask. And I want to support universities like this one. Here’s one of the reasons why. 50, 000 students, 40 percent on Pell grants. A lot of people would never have gotten an education if it weren’t for the federal Pell grant program, right? But here’s what’s most impressive. A lot of schools have a lot of Pell grants. This university graduates all categories of students at the same rate. If you’re a Pell grant student, a   grant student, if you’re white,   Latina, Latino, Asian, everybody graduates at the same rate. And why that happens is because this university makes a particular commitment to every student, and moves as quickly as possible to help kids who maybe are first generation college students  —   right? I’ve got to tell you, when I got to college  —   now, my father went to college on a football scholarship. I knew I wasn’t going to college on a football scholarship. My mother had a very difficult childhood she never got to go to college. So my dad couldn’t really tell me much about going to college, because he basically played football for four years, and loved it. My mom couldn’t tell me. So when I got to college, I felt so out of place. I was so nervous. There used to be something way back in the dark ages called collect phone calls. Where you would call collect, which meant that your parents had to pay for it, and you just waited to see whether they’d accept it. So I called home and I said, I can’t  —   I can’t do this. It’s too hard.  Everybody here is smarter than I am. They’re better prepared than I am. I want to come home. And my father, who didn’t want me to go so far away to school anyway, he said, what? Come home. My mother said, no. You have to stick it out. And if you feel the same way at the end of the year, then you can make a different decision. Of course, my mother was right. I loved it within a month or two. But I know what it feels like to show up and wonder, can you make it? Are you good enough? Are you smart enough? [When Clinton talks about herself and her background, she frequently mentions her parents. At small businesses, she talks about her dad’s drapery business. Other times she talks about her mother’s very difficult childhood. And in this Tampa speech, she was on a college campus, so she talked about how nervous she was when she first went to college  —   a story she’s told before as well.] And thank goodness USF has people waiting to mentor and reassure and guide students. Every single college and university needs to have that. And then we’ve got to make it affordable so kids don’t have to leave because they no longer have the funding that they need. And I want to do more in my effort to make childcare affordable  —   no family should have to pay more than 10 percent of your income on childcare  —   and right now, you have a lot of states where it costs more for childcare than tuition at college and university. So I’m going to do  —   I know you’ve got childcare here, but as I told the president, I want to do more to help you to make sure every student parent has a safe place to bring their child while they’re studying and working, and trying to get their education. [Here’s where Clinton comes back to talk about the university where she is speaking, and ties its programs into her policy proposals.] And then we’re going to help everybody with student debt. How many of you have student debt? We’re going to help you pay it back and pay it off quickly. We’re going to get the interest rates down, we’re going to give you new ways of paying it. Because right now, we have too many people laboring under student debt in a way that holds your own futures back. So we’re going to lift that burden off of you, and we’re also going to make sure you can get quality affordable healthcare. Every age you are, every place you are, we’re going to get the costs down, premiums,   deductibles, and especially prescription drug costs. And there are two other things we’re going to take on. Because I’ve heard about this all across America. We’re going to take on helping more people with mental health and addiction problems get the help you need. So I’m excited about what we can do to create an economy, an education and health care system that works. And while we do it, we’re going to be protecting the rights of Americans. All Americans. We have fought too hard, we have come too far. And that means civil rights. And it means women’s rights, and gay rights, and voter rights, and workers’ rights, and disability rights. And, you know, I believe with all my heart, because I’ve done this work my entire life. I was looking at the disability sign there. My first job out of law school was with the Children’s Defense Fund. I did a lot of interesting things. And one of them was to gather evidence about why so many kids with disabilities were out of school. There was no requirement that you went to school if you were blind, deaf, in a wheelchair. And we changed the law. The first nation in the world to do that. And I am so proud of our country. So these rights are not for somebody else. We all know somebody  —   we all know a woman, we all know somebody in a racial or ethnic minority, we all know a worker or a voter, we all know a gay person, and we all know somebody with a disability. These are our rights. And the kinds of things that you’ve been hearing from Donald Trump, demeaning, defaming groups of Americans, people who have every right to be respected by someone who wants to be President of the United States, and he stands there and mocks a reporter with a disability, and he calls women pigs, and he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, and he demeans Muslims, and attacks a Gold Star family whose son died in action in Iraq  —   that’s not who we are. So, yes, we have a lot of plans, but we also have values, my friends. And we’re going to stand up for American values. [Clinton’s speech tends to be a mix of attacks on Donald Trump and an affirmative message about what she is proposing. And in almost every speech these days, she talks about how Donald Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants and Muslims is out of sync with American values. It’s a theme that came into full relief at the Democratic convention. There the unstated message was that this wasn’t a campaign between Trump and Clinton but between Trump and America, American values. Clinton has always had American flags at her events, but since the convention they have been even more prominent as a backdrop at her events.] Our book also outlines how we’re going to keep our country safe from all threats. We’re going to work with our allies, not insult them. We’re going to stand up to our adversaries, not cozy up to them. We’re going to have real plans, not claims and secret plans.  [You’ll notice it is   of the way through the speech before Clinton starts talking about national security. That is pretty standard for a Clinton speech. So much of her focus on the campaign trail is on domestic concerns, despite her credentials as the former secretary of state. How much Clinton emphasizes national security and foreign affairs really depends on the speech, the setting, what is happening in the news that day. It tends not to be the bulk of her speech. And she often talks about foreign policy in contrast to her opponent.]  This November, the American people have a big choice to make when it comes to national security. On the one hand, we have Donald Trump  —   who has called the American military a disaster. Who disrespects our military leaders by saying, and I quote, ’I know more about ISIS than the generals do.’ His companies  —   and listen to this, because I know there are a lot of veterans and a lot of, you know, active duty people based here in Tampa  —   his companies, Trump companies have fired veterans because they had to take time off to fulfill their military commitments. And we all saw him disparage the Khans, a Gold Star family who lost their son in a car bomb explosion in Iraq, as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of the people in his unit, and saving hundreds of his fellow soldiers. And when asked why he would insult a Gold Star family, he suggested that his sacrifices are somehow comparable to theirs, because he said, and again I quote  —   you can’t make this up  —   he said, ’I work very, very hard. I’ve had tremendous success.’ His whole campaign has been one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform to protect our most cherished American values. And a man who is so wrong about our veterans isn’t right to serve as our   . And when it comes to fighting ISIS, he has been all over the map. You would have to literally map it out. He’s talked about letting Syria become a free zone for ISIS. Look at the map, Donald. He’s talked about sending in American ground troops. Not on my watch. That is not what we are going to do.  He’s even talked about using nuclear weapons. He’s very loose in his talk about nukes. He says he doesn’t care if other countries get them. He doesn’t know why they haven’t been used already. I mean, it’s so  . When I hear these things, I say, that can’t be true. And then they replay it for me again. He says he has a secret plan to defeat ISIS. But the secret is, he has no plan. After all his talk, the only thing that is clear is he has no clue about what he’s talking about.  [This section was a new addition to Clinton’s stump speech and as a result is what many of the beat writers following her campaign wrote about that day.] And rather than work with our allies, he chooses to insult them. Just last week in a few hours, he managed to turn his trip to Mexico into an embarrassing international incident. He got into a Twitter war with the President of Mexico. He is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.  [Clinton has been driving home the message since early June when she began turning her attention to the general election. No matter what else she says, Clinton finds a way in every speech to say Trump is ”temperamentally unfit” to be president. She also seems to relish mocking Trump for his Twitter habits. She’s had various digs about Trump and his tweeting over the months, though this one was added after Trump’s trip to Mexico.] As president, I have a very different vision. I will give our military everything they need when they’re serving overseas. I will support them with care and the benefits that they need and deserve when they come back home, including job training and mental health care. I will work closely with our allies, not just to contain ISIS, but defeat them. First, we’re going to take out their stronghold in Iraq and Syria. Second, we’re going to dismantle their global terror infrastructure on the ground and online. Third, we’re going to bolster our defenses, including with an intelligence surge, to protect us and our allies. We will do whatever is necessary for as long as it takes to bring ISIS to justice and end their reign of terror for once and for all. And I will tell you this. I am a very patient person. I don’t quit. I don’t give up. I don’t blink. This Sunday will be the 15th anniversary of the attack of  . I was a Senator from New York. I knew people who were killed. I worked with families and the few survivors. I worked to get the health care needed by our first responders and emergency workers who ran toward danger. I worked to make our country safer and to rebuild New York and the Pentagon.  [Clinton has spoken about being the junior senator from New York on   many times. But how she talks about it changes depending on the setting. Sometimes it is to make a point about bipartisanship, working with a Republican president, governor and mayor to secure recovery funding. Sometimes it is to make a point about determination and the long slow effort to get long term health care expenses covered for first responders. Sometimes it is to make a point about Americans coming together. Sometimes it is all of those things.] But I always, always was determined to do anything I could to bring bin Laden to justice. And thanks to the very patient, painstaking work of the American intelligence community, finally, when I was Secretary of State, we were given the opportunity to evaluate the best evidence we had seen in a long time. And I was honored to be part of that small group in the Situation Room advising President Obama as we went through the evidence over and over and over again, trying to decide, was it credible enough, strong enough, to take action? And if we did, what kind of action? Would it be a missile strike? Would it be a bombing? Would it be an attack by special forces? And when it came time to go around the table, these were all extremely experienced, thoughtful experts. We all gave our opinions. I was one who said I thought it was worth the risk. And I was in that small Situation Room on that day. [Clinton also talks about her time in the White House situation room for the Osama Bin Laden raid with some frequency, to make a point about the difficult choices only a president can make and to remind people that she was there, and was among those urging President Obama to go for it.] You all know the story. Some of you read the book. Some of you have seen the movies. But there’s one thing I want to tell you because it demonstrates again what our values are as Americans. Remember, Donald Trump has said he would order American troops to torture. He would order American troops to murder family members of terrorists. That’s what he has said, heedless of the consequences that that would lead to in terms of putting Americans all over the world at even greater risk. But here’s what happened that night in Pakistan. And this is not an   part of the story, so I want to tell you, particularly the young people here, particularly active duty and military veterans like Mary. If you saw any of the reenactment, you know that one of the helicopters clipped its tail as it was going into the courtyard on the wall. It disabled that helicopter. Now, thankfully, every contingency had been thought through. And so we were prepared for that. The military was prepared. They could get another helicopter there to take out the SEALs who were going to have to blow up the disabled helicopter. After rushing into the compound, taking out the two bodyguards, taking out bin Laden’s adult son, taking out bin Laden, they knew they had to get out of there. At any time, there could have been Pakistani military wondering, what’s going on? Something’s happening. And this was a military garrison town. So time was really precious. But here’s what the SEALs did. Before they blew that helicopter up, they took out all the women and children, family members of terrorists, including the worst terrorist of all. They took them out of the compound, around the back to safety, before they blew that helicopter up. That, Donald Trump, is what American honor looks like. [Clinton first talked about this part of the   raid in a June speech in San Diego, to make the point that Donald Trump’s suggestions about how he would deal with terrorists and their families is out of line with American values.] I want to mention just three other threats, one threat here right at home, the epidemic of gun violence. And we have got to have comprehensive background checks. Close the gun show loophole. Close the online loophole. End the ability of people on the terrorist watch list buying a gun in America. This agenda I’ve just briefly outlined is supported by a vast majority of Americans and a vast majority of gun owners. And it’s time we all said in one voice, hey, we can respect the Second Amendment. We can respect the right to own arms. But we don’t want people who shouldn’t have guns in the first place killing anybody else ever again. Another threat to our country is climate change. 2015 was the hottest year on record, and the science is clear. It’s real. It’s wreaking havoc on communities across America. Last week’s hurricane was another reminder of the devastation that extreme weather can cause, and I send my thoughts and prayers to everyone affected by Hermine. But this is not the last one that’s going to hit Florida, given what’s happening in the climate. Nobody knows that better than folks right here in Tampa and in the broader region. Sea levels have been rising here about an inch per decade since the 1950s. At the rate we are going, by 2030, which is not that far away, $70 billion of coastal property in this state will be flooding at high tide. And whenever our infrastructure is threatened, so too is our homeland security. The next president will have to work with communities like Tampa’s to prepare for future storms. When I’m in the Oval Office, I’m going to work with local leaders to make smart investments in infrastructure to help protect regions from flooding and other effects of climate change. I’m going to continue to continue to work on the international and national level to try to turn the clock back, to stabilize and reduce emissions even more, to try to gain more time. But we’re going to have to begin working immediately on mitigation and resilience and prevention as well. And what about Donald Trump? Well, he doesn’t even believe in climate change. He says it’s a hoax invented by the Chinese. And he says, ’You can’t get hurt with extreme weather.’ Now, this is the same guy who at one of his golf courses in some coastal place has demanded that a seawall be built to protect his golf course from rising tides. So it’s all fine if it affects Donald, but if it affects the rest of humanity, he could care less. If it affects people to lose their homes or their businesses that took a lifetime to build, it doesn’t matter to him. When it comes to protecting our country against natural disasters and the threat of climate change, once again Donald Trump is totally unfit and unqualified to be our president. And let’s not forget the next president also has to keep our country safe from public health crises like Zika. It’s painfully obvious we can’t rely on the Republican Congress or Republican governors to fund an adequate response. They can’t help themselves from playing games even when lives are on the line. I call on all Republicans to put people before politics and finally vote in favor of a clean funding bill to fight Zika right here in Florida. But the failure of the Republicans in Congress, including your Republican Senator, means that we can’t always count on them, can we? So last month I announced that as president, I will create a public health rapid response fund to be available when emergencies occur, to have a consistent budget to better enable government agencies at all levels to quickly respond to major public health crises and pandemics. This will complement our efforts to prepare our country to deal with those challenges, and because of climate change, we’re going to have more of them. Because of mobility around the world, you can get on a plane in Africa and bring Ebola to the United States. You can be a mosquito in Brazil and make your way to Florida. We’ve got to be better prepared. It’s always better to invest a penny in the front end than to have to pay many dollars after the crisis has already occurred. That’s why it is time that when we talk about protecting public health, to put politics aside and put our people’s needs first. Now, I’m excited about doing all of this with you, for you, on your behalf. But I can’t do it without you. And here’s what I’m asking. The deadline to register voters is October 11th. If any of you are not registered, or you’re not sure you are registered, or you’re a student and you’re registered somewhere else but it would be more convenient to vote here, you have until October 11th. So please learn how to register. You can go to iwillvote. com and learn how to do that. You can go to my website, hillaryclinton. com, and learn how to do that. We are also building volunteer teams. So you can get involved by going to hillaryclinton. com, or text ’join,’     to 47246. Or you can sign up here today  —   are there people with clipboards somewhere around here? On the way out, I guess. You can sign up here today to have a volunteer registration shift. [She always makes some variation on this pitch, encouraging people to sign up for text messages from the campaign and to put in time volunteering. There are two major purposes for a campaign    —   to get news coverage and to energize and mobilize the people in the room. Many in attendance are already volunteers, but seeing the candidate can get them more excited about putting in even more hours. One person I interviewed at this event had been volunteering, making phone calls for the campaign and had just decided to open up his home to let a campaign staffer stay there while working to get out the vote.] And you can also apply, if you’re really interested, to our Get Out the Vote fellowship program. We’re going to organize special groups to get people to the polls, and we need you. This state has so much promise, and I want to be the best president that you could possibly have in Florida. I want to work on all of these issues, everything that’s in this blueprint that we have published. And I want particularly to give the young people of this university, this state, this country, the best shot you can have to be part of the American dream however you define that. Many of us who came before know that there were barriers in the way. When I was a young woman, there were schools I couldn’t go to, jobs I couldn’t get, scholarships I wasn’t eligible for, just because I was a woman. And a lot of those barriers have been knocked down. For every African American, Latino, Asian American, Native American, gay American, you know that barriers have been knocked down. But they’re not all down, and we got to make sure they’re all gone and that no demagogue can ever bring them back and can ever exploit the fears and insecurities of the American people. [”Breaking Down Barriers” was an earlier campaign motto for Clinton, one that lasted from February through June and she still uses some of that language in her speech from time to time.] So please, vote this year like your future depends on it because it does. And if you give me the great honor of serving as your president, I will get up every single day in that White House and I will work my heart out for those better jobs, better educational opportunities, better health care with quality and affordability, protecting our rights, protecting our country, unifying America, because we need to be the United States, not the Divided States of America. And yes, remember, as that sign over there says  —   I believe this, too  —   ’Love Trumps Hate.’ Let’s have a future that proves that’s true! Thank you all! God bless you!”"
"As a young musician coming up in the early 1970s, Bruce Springsteen played in the bars of Asbury Park, N. J. a hardscrabble urban beach town full of colorful characters. The town fired his imagination and inspired him musically, but still he found himself longing for more. Springsteen tells Fresh Air’s Terry Gross that he knew that if he was ever going to make his mark on the larger world, it would be through his words. ”I looked at myself and I just said, ’Well, you know, I can sing but I’m not the greatest singer in the world. I can play guitar very well but I’m not the greatest guitar player in the world,’ ” Springsteen remembers. ”So I said, ”Well, if I’m going to project an individuality, it’s going to have to be in my writing.” Springsteen went on to record the album Born To Run in 1974 its title track paved the way for his mainstream popularity. The album also lends its name to his new memoir, in which Springsteen reflects on how he and his music were shaped by home, roots, family and community. What follows is the transcript of the conversation Springsteen and Gross had in the recording studio at his New Jersey home. Terry Gross: Bruce Springsteen, welcome to Fresh Air and thank you for welcoming us into your studio. I’d love it if you would start by reading the very opening from the foreword of your book. It’s really a fantastic book, and I’d like our listeners to just hear a little bit of your writing. Bruce Springsteen: OK, my pleasure. I come from a boardwalk town where almost everything is tinged with a bit of fraud. So am I. By twenty, no    rebel, I was a guitar player on the streets of Asbury Park and already a member in good standing amongst those who ”lie” in service of the truth . .. artists with a small ’a.’ But I held four clean aces. I had youth, almost a decade of   bar band experience, a good group of homegrown musicians who were attuned to my performance style and a story to tell.  This book is both a continuation of that story and a search into its origins. I’ve taken as my parameters the events in my life I believe shaped that story and my performance work. One of the questions I’m asked over and over again by fans on the street is ”How do you do it?” In the following pages I will try to shed a little light on how, and, more important, why. Thanks for reading that. So, what’s it like for you to write something that doesn’t have to rhyme, and that you don’t have to perform onstage? [laughs] Not having to perform it onstage is a good one. But it’s a little different, you know? I’m used to writing something, it becomes a record, it comes out, then I go perform and I play it and I get this immediate feedback from the audience, so that’s been the pattern of my life. But the book has been a little bit different, you know? I mean, you get feedback from the press and fans are just starting to get a chance to read it, so I’m looking forward to that. But you still had to find the music inside your language, you know? That’s a big part of what sort of moved me to begin writing the book. I wrote a little essay, and I felt, ”Yeah, this has a good voice. This has a good feeling. It feels like me.” But then once you get into the book, you’ve got to constantly find the rhythm of your prose, and it ends up being quite a musical experience either way. But that’s one of the things I love about the book, is that there is rhythm and music in it, even though it’s not a song. So, we’ll talk about this a little later if it’s OK with you, but in the book, you write about how in your 60s, you’ve experienced periods of profound depression. Yeah. And I’m wondering if that affected either the motivation for writing the book, your approach to writing the book, what you wanted to write about in the book? No, it really didn’t have anything to do with the book at all. The book was just something that came along after we played the Super Bowl and I wrote a little essay that went online. And I had two or three weeks and I said, ”Wow, that essay was pretty good. Maybe I’ll try and write some other stuff.” Writing about the depression  —   I just felt, you know, when you write a book like this you have to open up your life. You have to be willing to do so to a certain degree. And [my wife] Patti [Scialfa] was very gracious in the  —   to the extent that she allowed me to write the book. You know, there’s a lot of it that’s pretty personal. And I felt that it was connected to some of the music I had written, and so that was just an important thing to write about. So many of your songs, particularly the early ones, are about searching for a dream and wanting to bust out of the confines of your life. And in some ways, I get the impression from your book that that was your father’s story, except he never found the dream. It’s kind of a little bit like the story that you describe in your song ”The River.” Right. My dad was young, he went to work. But he’d been to war, he’d seen some of the world. It wasn’t like he was going to be an extensive traveler or something. It didn’t seem to be in his nature or in the nature of his parents or many of the folks in my family, really. We had a cousin that went off to Brown University  —   it was like a nuclear explosion took place, you know? It was just incredible for everybody. So I mean the book, yeah, you’re correct that my parents did really sort of live out a big part of that story. And, to a certain degree, he did find his little piece of what he was looking for in California.  Because when you were 19, he moved to California. Yeah, they moved out West, which was a huge undertaking, because no one  —   it was like moving to another planet for them. But I think that’s what my father wanted to do, he wanted to move to another planet. And they had very little. They had $3, 000 and I think they had an old Rambler and they slept two nights in the car, and a night in a motel and they had my little sister with them with all of the stuff packed on top. It was a really    decision and it did pay off for them, you know. I think they enjoyed the West Coast and their California life quite a bit, you know. My father still had periods of illness that were  —   You’re talking about mental illness. Yeah. Difficult to manage. But I believe he did feel like he found something there that he couldn’t have found at home. Do you think the song ”Born To Run” is in part about him and in part about you? Well, someone mentioned that to me the other day. I always thought it was just about me. [Laughs] But what do you know? And, looking back on it, my parents lived out quite a bit of that story themselves.  Except you had a dream in a way that your father maybe didn’t have a dream that he could articulate?  It certainly wasn’t one he could articulate. It was just,”I gotta get out of here.”  So, this story I think is really interesting. You tell the story of how in 1967, there’s a lot of friction between you and your father, and you’re in your teens, you’re growing your hair long, you’re into music. And long hair then, probably particularly in the working class town where you were, was a pretty  —   It was unusual. Radical thing. It was an unusual thing, it was. Making a statement. [Laughs] You were making a statement. [Laughs] So you were in a motorcycle accident, got thrown, like, 20 feet, really hurt yourself pretty bad. You were in the hospital. You get home, your father calls in a barber, and the barber cuts your hair against your will. [Laughs] It’s funny now. I didn’t think it was funny then. I’ll bet you didn’t! But I was lucky I survived the motorcycle accident, because the bike went under the car. I flew out about 20 or 25 feet, I didn’t have a helmet on, I hit my head on the pavement and knocked myself out, gave myself a brain concussion, screwed up my left leg. And I was lucky then that I didn’t get killed, because I didn’t have any protective clothing on whatsoever. And I took a pretty good beating. But yes, such was the nature of the day when the barber was called in and Samson’s locks were trimmed. But I actually found it an upsetting story, because here you barely survived. You’re lying there disabled and your father takes advantage of you and cuts off something that you love that’s part of your identity, when you’re already so physically wounded. It felt very unfair to me. How did it feel to you at the time? [Laughs] Such was the lay of the land at the time. I mean, of course I was furious about it at the time. But what can you say  —   it’s water under the bridge. So you write, too, about your father that he was kind of very  —   let me quote you, because you put it so well. You write that, ”He loved me but he couldn’t stand me. He felt we competed for my mother’s affections. We did. He also saw in me too much of his real self. Inside, however, beyond his rage, he harbored a gentleness, timidity, shyness and a dreamy insecurity. These were things I wore on the outside and the reflection of these qualities in his boy repelled him. I was ’soft’ and he hated ’soft.’ Of course, he’d been brought up ’soft.’ A mama’s boy just like me.”  So that timidity and shyness that you wore on the outside, it’s kind of like the opposite of your stage persona. I know, it’s bizarre. Can you tell us a little bit more about the timidity and shyness of your youth? Yeah, well,   Burnett once said that much of rock music is simply going ”Waaah Daddy!” So I gotta take my, I’ve gotta take some blame for that myself, I guess. [Laughs] But, yeah, when I was young, I was very shy and that was my personality, you know. I was a pretty sensitive kid and quite neurotic, filled with a lot of anxiety, which all would have been very familiar to my pop, you know? Except it was a part of himself he was trying to reject, so I got caught in the middle of it, I think. You say in the book that you were so nervous for a while during your childhood that you’d blink, like, 100 times a minute.  Haha, yeah. And you chewed your knuckles. Was there a specific cause of that anxiety or was it just, do you think, the way you were wired? I mean, I never found out, you know. It was just tremendous anxiety, you know. Tremendous feeling of being out of control of your young life. So do you think that your stage persona draws both from the angry and uninhibited side of you and the more inhibited, timid side of you? I think it’s both there. I think if you just, you know, I think plenty of folks, if you just looked at the outside, it’s pretty   which is a little ironic, because that was personally never exactly really me. I think I created my particular stage persona out of my dad’s life and perhaps I even built it to suit him to some degree. When I was looking for a voice to mix with my voice, I put on my father’s work clothes, as I say in the book, and I went to work. Whether it was a result of wanting to emulate him so I felt closer or whether it was, as I say in the book, I wanted to be the reasonable voice of revenge for what I had seen his life come to. It was all of these things. And so it was an unusual creation, but most of these  —   most people’s stage personas are created out of the flotsam and jetsam of their internal geography and they’re trying to create something that solves a series of very complex problems inside of them or in their history. And I think, annoyingly, when I went to do that, that’s what I was  —   I was trying to integrate all of these very difficult things that I’d been unable to integrate in my life and in my life with my parents. So, you also lived near the church and church was a part of your life. And you write about Catholicism, ”This is the world where I found the beginnings of my song. In Catholicism, there existed the poetry, danger and darkness that reflected my imagination and my inner self. I found a language of great and harsh beauty, of fantastic stories, of unimaginable punishment and infinite reward.”  Are there particular Bible stories or religious paintings that really made an impression on you?  No, it was more just the basics. I think when you’re a child, you just cling to the basics, which is the basic story of Jesus and the Crucifixion and hell and eternal punishment and the flames. This was all stuff that was, when you’re young, this is very tangible and is as real as the gas station next door to you. Maybe especially since the church was just about next door to you. Exactly! So these things, and also because we lived in the presence of the church and the convent and the rectory and the school   and this was an enormous cornerstone in the lives of my entire family. They were all pretty serious Catholic churchgoers. And as a child, these things were very, very terrifying. What things? Were you afraid of hell? Haha, yeah. Eternal damnation? [Laughs] That one too! So, these were stories that were not stories, you know? They were simply facts. This is what occurred. This is what can occur, unless you toe the line, my friend. So, when you’re a child  —   and you forget that the Catholic religion at the time was much darker and more mysterious. The entire Mass was in Latin. If you go to my church now it’s incredibly bright inside, but when I was young, it was very dark inside. It was just the difference in the way they’ve painted it since I’ve gone there and it strives for a very different and welcoming spirit. Where when I was young, it was sort of built to intimidate, even on this very local level and this very small church in this small town, it still held you in the palm of its darkness. And it was something I carried with me, never forgot, brought into my music, and it’s been in my music ever since. So when your father told the family that he had to leave New Jersey and go to California and he was going to do it, he hoped the family came with him, but he was going to go one way or the other. And so he left, your mother went with him, your youngest sister went with him, your sister who was in the middle was 17, she had just gotten pregnant, you say she didn’t even know how to make toast. [Laughs] And your parents left.  I may be a little harsh on her there. I think she knew how to make toast. [Laughs] And you were 19. And suddenly, there were no authority figures in your life. I mean, your parents were gone, your father wasn’t going to  —   whatever he was doing, he wasn’t going to do it anymore. He wasn’t going to be around. What did that freedom feel like to you? By the time I was 19, my parents weren’t very authoritative over my life. You were already gone? Yeah. At the time, I was already down at the Shore and I was staying out overnight and sleeping on the beach and, you know, coming home at 3, 4 a. m. after having played a show in some club. And so, I was five years into my own life already. It started when I was 14  . And I didn’t have any doubt at that time about what I was going to do or where I was going. I was a musician. I was going to play. I had a band. We were gonna make enough money to survive on. I was quite prepared for that to occur, whereas my sister was in a very different situation. She just had a newborn and a new marriage and really missed the family when they left.  During your early years as a musician, you were in Asbury Park, boardwalk, carnival atmosphere. What did you love about that kind of urban beach?  Yeah. And Madame Marie and all the boardwalk regulars. I mean, you made great stories out of those characters, great songs out of those characters. But what appealed to you about knowing them and writing about them?  It was just my location at the time. I didn’t move to Asbury with the thought of  —   it wasn’t an anthropological  —   But you connected in some way  —    —   reason, but I went and I just fit in there. Asbury was down on its luck, but not as bad as it would get. And so there was a lot of room to move, you know, clubs were open until 5 a. m. there were gay clubs, in even the late ’60s, it was a bit of an open city. So as young ne’   we fit very comfortably in that picture, and then when I went to write, I just wrote about what was around me, which is kind of something I’ve done for most of my life. And it fired my imagination, it of course was a colorful locale. The city was filled with characters and plenty of people at loose ends, and so it just became a very natural thing to write about. I didn’t give it too much thought at the time, but I did think that it gave me a very individual identity, and that if I was going to go out into the musical world on a national level, I was very interested in being connected to my home, my home state, my home base. And I thought all of these things were very local, and they were very much mine, there wasn’t anyone else writing in this way about these things at that time. So it was something I did very intentionally in a sense, as creating a certain very, very specific and original identity.  And that’s one of the things that really interests me in comparing you to Dylan. Because when you first started, people were comparing you to Dylan, one of the ”new Dylans,” and everything.  In some ways,   you’re the opposite. Because he’s always  —   he changed his name. He surrounded himself in mystery. His lyrics are very obscure.  And your lyrics tell stories. You’re all about a place. You reveal so much about yourself and the world around you in your songs. You know what I mean? I know that you’re more than what you literally tell us about in the songs, but still, you have an identity and tried to tell us something of who you are in your songs.  You just go where your psychology leads you, I think. You know, I’ve always loved the fact that Bob’s been able to sustain his mystery over 50 or 60 years. In this day and age, that’s quite a feat in itself and, you know, the things that I loved about Bob’s music  —   and I describe him in the book as a father of my country, which he really is  —   were things that just didn’t fit when I went to do my job, you know? I had come out of a somewhat different circumstance and the clothes just didn’t fit. I want to quote you again. So you write, this is toward the beginning of your career: ”I wanted to be a voice that reflected experience and the world I live in. So I knew in 1972 that to do this, I would need to write very well and more individually than I had ever written before.” And at some point you realized, too, that although you had the most popular bar band in Asbury Park, that there was a bigger world, there were a lot of talented people, and in order to be someone in that world, to have a career, to make a difference, that you had to figure out what was unique about you and you had to write great songs.  And, in fact, you achieved that. You wrote great songs, but how did you go about trying to write the best songs that you could? I mean, when you knew that a lot of this was going to depend on the songwriting? When I thought about signing a record deal or writing something that might put me in the position  —   because I had already had plenty of things that had fallen through with my rock bands  —   I looked at myself and I just said, ”Well, you know, I can sing but I’m not the greatest singer in the world. I can play guitar very well but I’m not the greatest guitar player in the world. What excites me about a lot of the artists I love?” And I realized, well, they created their own personal world that I could enter into through their music and through their songwriting. There’s people that can do it instrumentally, like Jimi Hendrix or Edge of U2 or Pete Townshend. I didn’t have as unique a purely musical signature. I was a creature of a lot of different influences, and so I said, ”Well, if I’m going to project an individuality, it’s going to have to be in my writing.” And at the time, for one of the few times in my life, I didn’t have a band. I just had myself and the guitar, so I was going to have to do something with just my voice, just the guitar and just my songs that was going to move someone enough to give me a shot. So I wrote songs that were very lyrically alive and lyrically dense and they were unique. But it really came out of a motivation to where I understood I was going to have to make my mark that way.  You’ve lived a lot of your life on the road, and for the first half  —   well, I’m not going to do the math here, but for a lot of your early years  —   I mean, you were single, you were in monogamous or   relationships, as you describe it. But you weren’t married and you didn’t have children. But you had a first marriage and then Patti Scialfa joined the band and you got married and you have three children now. Yes. What did it take for you to see family as something that was a wonderful thing, as opposed to something that was going to harm your sense of freedom and flexibility and creativity?  I think for a lot of musicians, that’s a difficult call. Because by nature we’re transient. We move on. We’re people that  —   like I say in the book, there’s folks that stay and there’s folks that go, and we’re folks that go. I didn’t have a blueprint from my childhood that I could call on, which is an enormous deficit when you’re trying to put together a family life. I didn’t see a family life where men were thriving inside of it. My dad tended to blame the family for his inability to achieve what he wanted to achieve, you know? So, unfortunately, I was coming from that particular frame of mind, and it took quite a bit of work and time and mistakes to begin to feel, to understand the strength that comes along with building a home life, you know? That was very mysterious to me, I was very skeptical of it for a long time, and didn’t understand it fully until Patti and I got together.  Was it helpful to be married to somebody in the band? Because she would certainly understand what life on the road was and what being a musician is because she is one. Yeah, I think so. Patti was an artist and a musician and she was a songwriter and she was a lot like me in that she was transient also. She worked busking on the streets in New York, she waitressed, she just lived a musician’s life, she lived an artist’s life. So we were both people who were very uncomfortable in a domestic setting, getting together and trying to build one. And seeing if our particularly strange jigsaw puzzle pieces were going to fit together in a way that was going to create something different for the two of us  —   and it did. You write about redefining what it meant to you to be a man, that you’d learned about the rigidity in the   narcissism of manhood, ’  from your father and you learned to always withhold something  —   you do not lower your mask. Did you consciously rethink what it meant to be a man? These are hard questions. Fresh Air is difficult! Let me think. Well, you know, you’re young and you’re always in pursuit of your young manhood. You know, you’re trying to figure out, what does that mean? There’s a lot of pressure on young men to sort that out, and we tend to gravitate towards   iconography as far as what it means to be a fully grown man. And part of my onstage creation was someone trying to sort that out. I think initially, our audiences were filled with young men. Our initial audience was a lot of young guys who you played a bit of a   role for, and were trying to sort out a lot of the same things, right? As soon as ”Born To Run” hit, you know. So, it was something that I worked pretty hard on. You started going to therapy in 1983. And at some point, you say in your 60s you had a really bad depression. And I’m wondering if you thought about, during that period when you were very depressed, how many people in the world really wanted to be you?  It doesn’t count for that much at the time. Yeah. Right. But people see you on stage and, yeah, I’d want to be that guy. I want to be that guy myself very often, you know? I had plenty of days where I’d go, ”Man, I wish I could be that guy.” And there’s a big difference between what you see on stage and then my general daily, my daily existence. You write about how being on stage is almost like medicine for you?  Sure! Does it get you out of yourself?  Oh, of course. You’re immediately pulled out of the inside of your head. I have been on stage on a few occasions where I felt I couldn’t escape the interior of my interior thoughts, but Peter Wolf once said, ”What’s the strangest thing you can do onstage? Think about what you’re doing.” There’s just nothing weirder you can do. If you’re up there thinking about what you’re doing, you’re just not there. And it’s not gonna happen, you know. So trying to learn how to overcome those  —   which is a normal thing to do, you’re in front of a lot of people, people are going to get very  . So you have to learn to sort of overcome that tendency towards   and just blow it wide open and you just jump in and join all those people that are out there enjoying what you’re doing together.  During the depression, there was a period of a year and a half when you weren’t on the road. You were home with one of your sons, I guess with your youngest? Mhmm.  Did that contribute to the depression because you couldn’t be on stage and you couldn’t have that kind of cathartic experience? Yeah, I tend to be not my own best company. So I can get a little lost if I don’t have my work to occasionally focus me. But at the same time, you’ve got to be able to figure that out. The year and a half I was home, my son was in his last year of high school and it was kind of my last opportunity to be here with him in the house and I wanted to get that right.  So, I want to ask you about a physical thing that happened to you that you write about in the book. You were getting numbness and tingling in, was it your left hand? My left hand and arm, yeah. Yeah, and it was hard for you to play. And it turned out you had a disc problem in your neck. Right. And you had this, wow, incredible surgery where they make an incision in your throat, push the vocal cords aside and basically rebuild your discs? Correct. It was probably from thrashing my head around for 40 years or so. But, you know, it was just wear and tear. And I had a pinched nerve and it was causing a lot of electricity down my arm, and I ignored it for about four or five years. It was just kind of getting worse and worse, but I was still able to get around on the guitar and then, during the end of  —   that was the middle of the Wrecking Ball tour, it simply became too much. I was having a lot of pain in my neck after the show and my arm was going numb and my fingers were going numb and towards the end of the night, it kind of got difficult to play. So I said, ”Well, I guess I have to do something about it.” So I found a doctor and it’s kind of an everyday operation, though you wouldn’t want to get it wrong, you know? You could lose your voice or lose complete feeling in your arms. It sounds terrifying! Putting your vocal cords aside? [Laughs] That was the part that was a little  . I said, ”Well, what happens?” and he says, ”Well, you know, we kind of slit your throat a little bit, then we go in and we pull your vocal cords and we tie them off to one side and then I get in there with the screwdriver and little tools and some titanium and we make a little basket in there. Then we take some bone off your hip and we stuff that into the basket and we kind of sew you back up and before long that all grows together and you’re as good as new.” Amazingly, that is exactly what happened. I spent about three months when I couldn’t sing at all, so that was  . But after that, I went back out. I sang for two hours in my garage one day to see if I had a voice. It seemed to be okay. And we went to South Africa and we just started playing, did the rest of the tour and it was much improved. So it’s remained much improved to this day. Did physical pain  —   was that part of the cause of the depression? Did it feed depression? Physical pain? Yeah. Physical pain is my friend. I pursue it every night for four hours! [Laughs] That makes me feel good! I’m a good Catholic boy! So no, I don’t think so. No, no. It didn’t have anything to do with it.  Do you feel like there’s an extrovert and an introvert within you that sometimes compete? Yeah, I suppose everyone has that. In me, it’s just a lot more noticeable. The extremes are a lot greater. I mean, if you see me performing, you’re going, ”That guy is simply the most extroverted guy I’ve ever seen! What a  !” But if you see me very often on a daily basis, and all the while growing up, I was very introverted. Very introverted. So I have sort of the extremes of both of those characteristics.  As you mention in your book, you wanted to write songs that you wouldn’t outgrow  —   that you could sing as an adult, that weren’t just kid songs. And done. Accomplished. But when you sing some of your early songs now, as you still do, like ”Born To Run,” does the song have a different meaning to you than it did when you first started performing it? We just had a series of concerts where the show was very interesting because we’d start out with my earliest material and we’d play it about half a record off our first record, and then half or   off of the second record, so it was going back to my earliest music and   my earliest songs that I wrote when I was 22. And it was funny that they just fit perfectly well, you know? I sort of gathered the years up as time passes, and you can revisit  —   the wonderful thing about my job is that you can revisit your    self or your    self any particular night you want. The songs pick up some extra resonance, I hope. But still, they’re there. And I can revisit that period of my life when I choose, so it’s quite a nice experience. And the songs themselves do broaden out as time passes and take on subtly different meanings, take on more meaning, I find. What’s an example of a song that’s taken on a different meaning or more meaning for you? A lot of the ones that are people’s favorites, you know. ”Born To Run,” that expands every time we go out. It just seems that more of your life fills it in, fills in the story, and when we hit it every night, it’s always a huge catharsis. It’s fascinating to see the audience singing it back to me. It’s quite wonderful to see people that intensely singing your song. As someone who grew up in Brooklyn and now lives in Philadelphia, I love that you’ve continued to live in New Jersey. Why have you stayed close to the home that your father left? Your father went to the opposite coast when you were a teenager. It’s rather ironic. But I just felt very comfortable here and I was uncomfortable with city life. I didn’t consider myself to be built for urban life. I was more or less a kid that came out of a small town and I was a beach bum and loved the ocean and loved the sun and I liked the people that were here. I liked who I was when I was here. I wanted to continue writing about the things that I felt were important, and those things were pretty much here. I felt it kept me in close contact with where I came from, which I was interested in doing. I felt like a lot of my heroes from the past lost themselves in different ways once they had a certain amount of success, and I was nervous about that and I wanted to remain grounded. And living in this part of New Jersey was something that was essential to who I was and continues to this day to be that way.  So we’ve been recording this interview in your home studio. Would you just tell us a little bit about the studio? I mean, it was built for you. Patti built this studio. She, with some help. This was just part of our garage. Yes, because I’m looking through a curtain, the curtain’s closed now, but when it was open, there was a big vintage car or truck or motorcycle. Yeah, there’s a lot of motorcycles over there. Most studios don’t have a garage attached to it like that. We’re surrounded by vintage automobiles and motorcycles. But this piece of the garage, Patti said, ”Well let’s make a studio out of it,” because we were using the house across the street to record in for a long time. And I said, ”Okay, go ahead, see what it’s about,” and she just did an incredible job building this facility here. But it’s like, if I had died when I was 15 and went to heaven, this is where I think I would have ended up. We’re surrounded by guitars, keyboards, recording decks. It’s just a paradise. Bruce Springsteen, I can’t thank you enough for inviting us into your studio and allowing us to do this interview. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, very enjoyable. And I really loved the book. Thanks a lot. "
"In a   exit interview, NPR’s Steve Inskeep asks President Obama about Russian interference in the U. S. election, executive power, the future of the Democratic party and his future role. Steve Inskeep: Thanks for joining us one more time I really appreciate it. President Obama: Great to be with you, Steve. Over my shoulder here is Theodore Roosevelt. In 1884, Theodore Roosevelt was frustrated about an election and wrote a letter saying the voice of the people might be the voice of God 51 times out of 100, but the other 49, it may be the voice of a devil or of a fool. Which do you think it was this time in 2016? Well, it’s hard to assess because we know for example that Hillary won the popular vote by a sizable margin. We know that there are a substantial number of voters out there who not only voted for me twice but currently support me who also voted for Donald Trump. So I think we have a scrambled political landscape right now. There are some things that we know are a challenge for Democrats  —   structural problems. For example, population distribution, oftentimes younger voters, minority voters, Democratic voters, are clustered in urban areas. And on the coasts, sure. And on the coasts, and so as a consequence you’ve got a situation where there’re not only entire states but also big chunks of states where, if we’re not showing up, if we’re not in there making an argument, then we’re going to lose. And we can lose badly, and that’s what happened in this election. Is this just a matter of showing up, or is there something wrong with the argument? Well. No, well, I don’t think there’s something wrong with the core argument that the Democratic Party has made for years. And the reason we know that is because on the individual issues that Democrats talk about there’s strong support. For example, the minimum wage. In every survey across the country, people support a higher minimum wage. There are clearly, though, failures on our part to give people in rural areas or in exurban areas, a sense    that we’re fighting for them or connected to them. Some of it is the prism through which they’re seeing the political debate take place. They may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms because it’s more controversial, it attracts more attention. I think that on something like the Affordable Care Act, you have people who are benefiting right now from Obamacare who either don’t know it’s Obamacare or consider that as a given and then end up voting on Second Amendment rights. So part of the reason it’s important to show up, and when I say show up, I don’t just mean during election time, but to be in there engaging and listening and being with people, is because it then builds trust and it gives you a better sense of how should you talk about issues in a way that feel salient and feel meaningful to people. And I’ve said this before. Part of the reason I got elected twice  —   and part of the reason why in a lot of these communities I still have pretty strong support. It was the incredible benefit that I had in first running for the United States Senate in a state that has a lot of rural communities and has a downstate that typically is suspicious of Chicagoans in the city. And just sitting down in people’s living rooms and VFW halls and at fish fries and listening to people. And then in Iowa, spending months traveling around the state and hearing people’s concerns and them hearing me and getting a sense that I get it. So that even during my low points in the presidency, when, you know, poll numbers were bad and news cycle was critical, people always felt as if I still cared about them  —   which meant that in 2012, I might still lose the overall vote and some of these counties or some of these voting districts, but I might lose   or   rather than  . That’s as a consequence of not only them seeing me in these places but it’s also a consequence of me actually being there and hearing them. Were Democrats failing to do that at every level because your party has lost the majority of races at almost every level at this point?  Well, you know, I think that we haven’t done it as well as we need to. For example, we know that the Republicans, funded through organizations like the Koch brothers, have been very systematic at. .. Building from ground up. Building from the ground up and communicating to state legislators and financing school board races and public utility commission races, and, you know, I am a proud Democrat, but I do think that we have a bias towards national issues and international issues, and as a consequence I think we’ve ceded too much territory. And I take some responsibility for that. You know, when I came into office, um, you know, we were just putting out fires. We were in a huge crisis situation. And so a lot of the organizing work that we did during the campaign, we started to see right away didn’t immediately translate to, wasn’t immediately transferable to, congressional candidates. And more work would have needed to be done to just build up that structure and, you know, one of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave, and something that, you know, I have some ideas about is, how do we do more of that ground up building? Do you intend to be involved or just give advice? Well, I think it’s appropriate for me to give advice because I need some sleep. And I’ve promised Michelle a nice vacation. My girls are getting old enough now where I’m clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house. But there was a political organization that was built around you that still exists. Well, I’m less likely to get involved in all the nuts and bolts of electioneering. In that realm, I’m much more likely to just give advice. What I am interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. There are such incredible young people who not only worked on my campaign, but I’ve seen in advocacy groups. I’ve seen passionate about issues like climate change or conservation, criminal justice reform, you know, campaigns for a livable wage, or health insurance, and making sure that whatever resources, credibility, spotlight that I can bring to help them rise up. That’s something that I think I can do well, I think Michelle can do well. That’s part of what makes me optimistic about our future because I know those young people are out there ready to lead, and when they start moving into more and more positions of authority, then I think the issues that I care most deeply about are going to be well served. You want to be a talent scout and build the bench that Democrats have admitted they don’t have. Well, not only a talent scout but I think also, you know, a coach, a friend, somebody who can build on the incredible work that has already been done by young people and that to a large degree was responsible for getting me elected. Did the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee  —   and other targets  —   actually affect the results of the election in your view? There’s no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere in which the only focus for weeks at a time, months at a time, were Hillary’s   the Clinton Foundation, political gossip surrounding the DNC. And that whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that number one, issues weren’t talked about a lot in the coverage. Huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that, what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively, her experience, her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of state, all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum, in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxieties and fears that some voters have, I think, definitely made a difference. Now know how you would, this . .. Could you say the election could have turned out differently? That’s what I want to know.  Well, elections can always turn out differently. You never know which factors are gonna make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact just based on the coverage. And by the way, I’m talking about mainstream news coverage. I’m not talking about a whole separate set of issues around fake news. I’m talking about what was in the New York Times and the Washington Post and on the nightly news and even on NPR. And it meant that the field where I think Hillary shone, the field of substance and talking about how we’re actually gonna increase people’s wages and how we’re gonna provide health care coverage to people and how we’re gonna deal with major issues like climate change  —   that wasn’t the field in which the campaign was ultimately decided. Was that the media’s fault for focusing on the wrong things or the candidate’s fault for not finding ways to get her message through?  Steve, you know, I’d say that Monday morning quarterbacking is always easy to do. And what I’ve said already publicly, and I’ll repeat: There is something about our current political ecosystem  —   and we’re all part of it, the parties, the candidates, the media, the voters  —   that leads us to avoid going deep into the issues that are really gonna affect people’s    lives, that put a premium on what here in the White House we call the shiny object: the faux scandals, the trumped up controversies, the, um, you know, insults that are flung back and forth. So that it ends up being covered like a reality show or  —   at best, a sporting event. And we lose track of the fact that this has an impact on some family that’s trying to send their kids to college, or some veteran who’s trying to get their benefits, or whether or not some of our young people get sent to a far away land to fight a war. And if we don’t, you know, do some hard reflection  —   all of us  —   on how that happens, then we’re like a body that is already weakened and then becomes more vulnerable to foreign viruses, becomes more vulnerable to manipulation and demagoguery and that’s something that I’m also going to be thinking a lot about in my afterlife, my  . You talked about this with the comedian Trevor Noah the other day. And you said a number of things in a row. You observed that there had been contacts between members of Mr. Trump’s staff and Russian officials. You noted that Trump benefited from the hacks. Your spokesman, Josh Earnest, has gone on to say this week that it’s obvious that Trump knew what was going on. To what extent are you suggesting some kind of cooperation between the   and Russian officials here? Well, I’m, I’m not suggesting cooperation at all. Keep in mind that those statements were in the context of everyone now acting surprised by the CIA assessment that this was done purposely to improve Trump’s chances. And my only point was that shouldn’t be treated as a blockbuster because that was the worst kept secret in this town. Everybody understood that. It was reported on. Steve, if you go back and look at your stories, if you read any mainstream publication, you would see that if you have a hack of the DNC and a hack of Hillary Clinton’s most senior advisers’   and those things are then released in    fashion over the course of months, and that seem to generate consistently negative coverage despite the fact that there’s nothing in there that’s particularly controversial, that it’s mostly just, as I said, political gossip or routine emails between folks who are working in a campaign environment, then it’s a pretty clear inference that people would draw, and did draw, that this was helping the Trump campaign and it was hurting the Hillary campaign. That doesn’t mean that the Trump campaign was coordinating. It just means that they understood what everybody else understood, which was that this was not good for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. And when you combine that with the fact that the   has been very honest about his admiration for Putin and that he hopes to forge a more cooperative relationship with him and focus on the threat of Islamic terrorism, then my only point was we shouldn’t now suddenly act as if this is a huge revelation. In October, we said, after being very careful about it because we had no interest in appearing as if we were putting our thumbs on the scales, we did what was almost unprecedented which was, every intelligence agency in the federal government arrived at a consensus, that the Russians had hacked the DNC. And the information that was now being released was as a consequence of a decision by Russian intelligence and Russian officials at the highest levels. So what the CIA is now assessing, which was it was done purposefully to tilt the election in the direction of a particular candidate, shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody. And in fact isn’t a surprise to anybody. And as I said before, the issue now is not relitigating the election. The issue now is for us to learn lessons so that we don’t have an ongoing situation in every election cycle where you have substantial foreign influence in our campaigns. There’s another issue going forward. Is it necessary for the security of the United States that Russia pay some price for doing this . ..? I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will, at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized some of it may not be. But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it. And there is, you know, among the big powers, there has been a traditional understanding of that everybody is trying to gather intelligence on everybody else. It’s no secret that Russian intelligence officers, or Chinese, or for that matter Israeli, or British, or other intelligence agencies, that their job is to get insight into the workings of other countries that they they’re not reading in the newspapers every day. There’s a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we’ve seen the Chinese do. And there’s a difference between that and activating intelligence, in a way that’s designed to influence elections. So we have been working hard to make sure that what we do is proportional. That what we do is meaningful. One of the things that we’re going to have to do over the next decade is to ultimately arrive at some rules of what is a new game. And that is the way in which traditional propaganda and traditional covert influence efforts are being turbocharged by the Internet and by the cyber world. And so the whole issue of cybersecurity and how we play defense, how we think about offense and how we avoid an escalation of a major cyber war, or a cyber arms race, is something that some of our smartest folks in government and in the private sector are spending a lot of time thinking about. Because there is an asymmetry here. We are more digitalized. Our economy is more advanced. It’s much wealthier. And it means that we have certain vulnerabilities that some of our adversaries don’t have. And this is actually a good example of where, in addition to whatever actions that we take bilaterally against Russia, we’ve got to spend some time working at an international level to start instituting some norms, the same way we did with things like nuclear weapons because ultimately we can have a situation where everybody’s worse off. That’s what we did with China when we were seeing repeated hacking primarily for industrial espionage purposes, commercial purposes. They were stealing, you know, technology and ideas. And I had a very blunt conversation and President Xi saying ”If you don’t stop it, here’s what we are going to do.” But what we also did was we mobilized the   and the G7, and the United Nations, to start adopting basic rules saying ”this is not something you do.” And that can make a difference over time. If whatever response you take is not completed by January 20th, do you have any reason to have confidence that President Trump will continue it? My view is that this is not a partisan issue. And part of what we should be doing is to try to take it out of election season and move it into governing season. The irony of all this, of course, is that for most of my presidency there’s been a pretty sizable wing of the Republican Party that has consistently criticized me for not being tough enough on Russia. Some of those folks during the campaign endorsed Donald Trump despite the fact that a central tenant of his foreign policy was we shouldn’t be so tough on Russia. And that kind of inconsistency, I think, makes it appear at least, that their particular position on Russia on any given day depends on what’s politically expedient. There was a poll that came out a couple of days ago that said that 37 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of Vladimir Putin. Think about that. Over a third of Republican voters think Putin is a good guy. This is somebody who  —   the former head of the KGB, who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn  —   is currently making decisions that’s leading to a slaughter in Syria. And a big chunk of the Republican Party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him. And my point here is that it’s very important that we do not let the inner family argument between Americans, the domestic political differences between Democrats and Republicans, obscure the need for us to stand together, figure out what it is that the Russians are interested in doing in terms of influencing our democratic process and inoculating ourselves from it. And that requires us having a   view about it. It requires us not to relitigate the election. It requires us not to point fingers. It requires us to just say ”Here’s what happened, let’s be honest about it and let’s not use it as a political football, but let’s figure out how we prevent this from happening in the future.” Because it’s not just going to be Russia. It sounds like you hope any response would continue after January 20. But do you have any reason to know that it would? Well, you know, I can’t . .. It’s up to him.  . .. look into my crystal ball and, that’s probably a question better directed at the  . I can say that I’ve had a conversation with the   about our foreign policy generally, and the importance of us making sure that, in how we approach intelligence gathering, in how we think about fighting terrorism and keeping the country secure, in how we think about, you know, our relationship to multilateral organizations, that, you know, we recognize America’s exceptionalism, our indispensability in the world, in part draws from our values and our ideals and the fact that even our adversaries generally respect our adherence to rule of law, our transparency, our openness. And if we start losing that, if other countries start seeing that ”Oh, America doesn’t care about these issues” or it’s just a ”might makes right” environment, and we’re not speaking out on behalf of our values and demonstrating our values, then America is going to be significantly weakened. Should   Trump, once he’s inaugurated, use his executive powers in the same way that you have? I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so. Keep in mind though that my strong preference has always been to legislate when I can get legislation done. In my first two years, I wasn’t relying on executive powers, because I had big majorities in the Congress and we were able to get bills done, get bills passed. And even after we lost the majorities in Congress, I bent over backwards consistently to try to find compromise and a legislative solution to some of the big problems that we’ve got  —   a classic example being immigration reform, where I held off for years in taking some of the executive actions that I ultimately took in pursuit of a bipartisan solution  —   one that, by the way, did pass through the Senate on a bipartisan basis with our help. I was very proud of that. I went out of my way to make sure our help was behind the scenes so that Republicans didn’t feel as if it was going to hurt them politically. At the end of the day, John Boehner and the House Republicans couldn’t pull the trigger on getting it done. And it was only then, after we had exhausted efforts for bipartisan reform that we took some additional steps on immigration executive actions. So my suggestion to the   is, you know, going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it’s harder to undo. And that doesn’t mean, though, that he is not going to come in and look at the various agencies and see the rules we’ve passed and if he wants to reverse some of those rules, that’s part of the democratic process. That’s, you know, why I tell people to vote because it turns out elections mean something. And this election means even more because the presidency, as has been widely noted, is so powerful. It’s grown more powerful over generations. You used your power in certain ways, and even in ways that you’d suggested in the past might be beyond your authority.  Well, no, I don’t think I’ve done that. If I’m thinking of immigration, for example.  Well, what I said with immigration reform was that I couldn’t simply sign a document that legalized 11 million people who had come here illegally and were currently undocumented. What I could do is find categories of people where we could not prioritize as significant risks. But what I always said was we couldn’t solve the basic problem of these folks being in the shadows without legislation. Let’s stipulate that you feel that what you did was clearly within the law. The question for me is has the presidency become too powerful in your view? I distinguish between domestic policy and foreign policy. I think on foreign policy, the concern I have right now is because we’re in a nontraditional war. It’s what we call the war on terrorism, although terrorism to some degree is a tactic. We’re in a war against a   a set of   actors that are operating in the shadows, are in nooks and crannies and crevices around the world. And what that means is that you’re never going to have a scene of surrender like we had with the Emperor [Hirohito] and Gen. MacArthur, where you don’t have a clear start and finish to the use of force. The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in. So for example, we’re still operating in our fight against ISIL without a new congressional authorization. It’s the authorization that dates back to  . And I think that is an area that we have to worry about. The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. But there have to be some guardrails. And what we’ve had to do on things like drones, or the NSA, or a number of the tools that we use to penetrate terrorist networks, what we’ve had to do is to build the guard rails internally. Essentially set up a whole series of processes to guard against government overreach, to reform some practices that I thought over time would threaten civil liberties. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven’t gone far enough on that. I would argue that we’ve gotten it about right, although I’m the first one to admit that we didn’t get it all right on day one. There were times where, for example, with respect to drones, that I had to kind of stop the system for a second, and say ”You know what? We’re getting too comfortable with our ability to take kinetic strikes around the world without having enough process to avoid consistently the kinds of civilian casualties that can end up actually hurting us in the war against radicalization.” On the domestic side, the truth is that, you know, there hasn’t been a radical change between what I did and what George Bush did and what Bill Clinton did and what the first George Bush did. It’s, you know, the issue of big agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Labor, having to take laws that have been passed, like the Clean Air Act, which is hugely complicated and very technical, and fill in the gaps and figure out our ”What does this mean and how do we apply this to new circumstances?” That’s not new. Having federal bureaucracies and federal regulations, that’s not new. I think that what’s happened that I do worry about is that Congress has become so dysfunctional, that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they’re not constantly refreshed and tweaked. Let’s go back to something like the Affordable Care Act. I could not be prouder of the fact that the uninsured rate has never been lower. That 20 million people have health insurance that we didn’t have before. But I said when the bill passed that it wasn’t perfect. Over the course of six years of implementing a very complicated piece of legislation that affects   of the economy, that there were going to be things we learned that would allow us to improve it. And I don’t know how many times I’ve said to Republicans, both publicly and privately, in State of the Union speeches, in town halls around the country, that if they’re willing to engage and work with me, then we can identify ways to tweak and improve this system so that more people have health insurance and it works even better and it’s more stable, and build on the things that seemed to have worked. For example, the fact that we’ve actually slowed the growth of health care costs since the bill passed. And each time I’ve said this, the basic Republican response has been ”No, all we want to do is repeal it. And we’ll replace it with something later.” And they’re still saying that now   although as we’ve seen, the best independent estimates are if you just repeal and you don’t replace you’re going to have 30 million people without health insurance, not to mention people who already have health insurance suddenly losing a lot of the benefits that individually are very popular though people don’t know that they’re part of Obamacare, like making sure that you don’t get barred from getting insurance if you have a   condition, or keeping your kid on your health care until they’re 26 years old. So the fierce partisanship, the unwillingness to engage in amending laws, fixing laws. That then leads to agencies having to scramble to do more work. And the bottom line is, if you want to   executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation. Couple of other things Mr. President: Is   Trump right that political correctness in this country has gone too far? We’ve discussed campus debates here. .. Yeah, we have. We have, and this is a tricky issue and here’s why: Because the definition of political correctness is all over the map. And I suspect the  ’s definition of political correctness would be different than mine. If what’s meant by political correctness is that there is some broad disapproval that’s expressed when somebody uses a racial epithet, or somebody makes a derogatory comment about women, or about the LGBT community, and people say, ”Hey, you shouldn’t do that. That’s wrong, that’s cruel, that’s hurtful. Here’s the history of that word.” And when you use words like that, you’re reinforcing people feeling like they’re outsiders, and less than other Americans. I don’t consider that political correctness. I consider that good manners, sound values and   gains in the nature of American society and American community. I think it’s a good thing that we don’t think that using the ”n” word is socially acceptable. I think it’s a good thing that we don’t refer to women in derogatory ways  —   because I have a couple of daughters, and I don’t want them to feel that way. Now, if you’re narrowly defining political correctness as a hypersensitivity that ends up resulting in people not being able to express their opinions at all without somebody suggesting they’re a victim, you know, if sort of, our social discourse and our political discourse becomes like walking on eggshells so that if somebody says ”You know what, I’m not sure affirmative action is the right way to solve racial problems in this country,” and somebody’s immediately accused of being racist, well, then I think you have a point. Although I happen to approve of affirmative action, but I think that I can have a polite dialogue with somebody who differs from me on that issue. And so, on the one hand, my advice to progressives like myself, and this is advice I give my own daughters who are about to head off to college, is don’t go around just looking for insults. You’re tough. If somebody says something you don’t agree with, just engage them on their ideas. But you don’t have to feel that somehow because you’re a black woman that you’re being assaulted. But speak up for yourself, and if you hear somebody saying something that’s insulting, feel free to say to that guy, ”You know what? You’re rude” or ”you’re ignorant” and take them on. But the thing that I want to emphasize here though is, the irony in this debate is   you’ll hear somebody like a Rush Limbaugh, or other conservative commentators, or you know, radio shock jocks, or some conservative politicians, who are very quick to jump on any evidence of progressives being ”politically correct,” but who are constantly aggrieved and hypersensitive about the things they care about, and are continually feeding this sense of victimization, and that they are being subject to reverse discrimination. Look, I had to live through controversies like the notion that I was trying to kill Christmas. Right? Well, where’d that come from? Well, you know, ”He said ’Happy Holidays’ instead of ’Merry Christmas,’ so that must be evidence of him either not being a Christian or not caring about Christmas.” It sounds funny now, but you’ll have entire debates in conservative circles around that. So it cuts both ways. And my advice to young people, and my advice to all of us as citizens, is to be able to distinguish between being courteous and being thoughtful and thinking about how words affect other people and not demonizing others versus having legitimate political debates and disagreements. This raises one other question though, Mr. President. We’ve talked with a lot of voters, and it’s clear that for many people this has been an agonizing year, an agonizing political year, even for people whose side won. Is it possible, though, that that agony has been good for the country because we are confronting issues of race and identity and the way the economy is structured, issues that have been with us for a long time? I think that’s a really interesting point. I’ve been accused by friends, enemies, my wife, of sometimes being overly optimistic. But what can I tell you, this is this is my temperament generally. And we are going through some growing pains right now, because the world is changing really fast, and it has throughout my presidency. I started my presidency inheriting a massive crisis of proportions that we haven’t seen since the 1930s. It laid bare some   and troubling trends about globalization, and technology, and rising inequality, and the fragility of our financial systems, and the way in which   folks felt they were getting squeezed. And the fact that the ladders of opportunity seem to be farther and fewer between for people who are trying to get out of poverty. And throughout that process, we also then started seeing  —   because when the economy’s not doing well some other tensions get laid bare  —   changing attitudes about sexual orientation, and about race, and about the nature of families. And all of this has been amped up by the revolution in information, throwing through social media and the Internet. And so it’s a big dose. It’s been a lot of stuff that’s been coming at people really quickly, and it’s made folks anxious. But I do think that part of the reason for these tensions is because we’ve been starting to wrestle with some things that ultimately are solvable if we make some good decisions. The economy right now is stable. And so we have some time to say to ourselves, even though it’s stable right now, the trend lines are such where more and more jobs are going to be digitalized, more and more jobs are going to be robotized. What are we going to do to make sure that as more workers are moving out of manufacturing into the service sector, that they are getting a decent wage? How are we going to create more jobs once   cars eliminate a bunch of   jobs of just driving and moving stuff around? How do we rebuild our infrastructure and rebuild our education system? We can solve these things, but it’s going to be challenging. And we’ve got to have an honest debate about it. With respect to how we deal with each other, the demographics of the country are going to change. It’s inevitable. The Latino community in America is going to grow. If you stopped all immigration today, just by virtue of birth rates, this is going to be a browner country. And if we’re not thinking right now about how we make sure that next generation is getting a good education and are instilled with a common creed and the values that make America so special and are cared for and nurtured and loved the way every American child is treated, then we’re not going to be as successful. But the good news is we’ve got time to do it. With respect to race and the relationship between the   community and police, all these smartphones suddenly taking pictures are not documenting a suddenly worsening relationship between the   community and the police. They are recording what has been a   tension and the sense on the part of police that they’re put in a very difficult situation of trying to manage law enforcement in poor communities where guns are easily accessible, the   community being rightly convinced that there is a long history of racial bias in our criminal justice system. And as painful as it is, that conversation is long overdue. So, my feeling is that if everybody takes a breath, and if we can structure a conversation that is less about ”how somebody else is trying to take advantage of me,” and structure the conversation around ”how can we work together to solve problems that makes everybody better off?” that America can emerge stronger. But that requires leadership. It requires citizenship. It requires all of us doing   at the same time as we’re fighting on behalf of the things that we care deeply about. And I speak as a progressive Democrat who is really, really proud of the work we’ve done. I can say, and I can demonstrate, I can document that the country is a lot better off now than it was when I took office in almost every dimension. But what I can also say is that we could be doing even better. There are times where I reflect and ask myself if, ”Is there’s something else I could have done, something that I could have said slightly differently that would have led to additional progress and less polarization?” And I’ll probably, you know, as I reflect on my presidency, once I’m out of just the    scrum of this thing, I’m sure I’ll come up with a whole bunch of things to add to my list. But I think all of us have to do that. You know, I’ve said this before: This is advanced democracy, what the founders set up. And, you know, if we either celebrate or despair just around presidential elections, without spending enough time focusing on how, in our    lives, in our local civic lives, in our media, in our culture, if we’re not spending enough time reflecting on, ”What am I doing to be part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem?” Then we’ll get better presidents and worse presidents, but we’re not going to get to where we need to go. If you’ll forgive a final question: I know you get letters and that your staff gives you a few letters to read each day. What have the letters been like since the election?  Well, there’s, for not just Democrats, but also for a number of young people, I think that there’s been concern, fear, in some cases. The letters that worry me most are letters from either teachers or students themselves, where they say, ”I’m in a majority Latino school, and I’m teaching third graders, and a child will go up to a teacher and say, ’Why don’t people like me?’ ” Or a Muslim college student who starts thinking that there’s no place for her in this country that she loves. Those are the most worrisome and those are ones where I respond and say that you have to have faith in the basic goodness of this country and that it outweighs the bad. You’ve been writing back?  Yeah, I generally write back as many of the 10 letters I get a night. Now to be fair, because, you know, I try to make sure that I’m not just getting letters from supporters. There’s been some letters that say, ”I am so glad you’re getting out of here. Good riddance. You’ve been a horrible president.” And uh, . .. You write them back, too? And ”America’s great again.” Sometimes I do. The most interesting letters I get, because they’re unexpected, and I’m talking about since the election, have been people who’ve written and said, ”I didn’t vote for you, but I want you to know that I appreciate the manner in which you’ve conducted yourself in office. And I think that you’ve been a good dad.” In some cases they said, ”In retrospect I think you did a pretty good job.” Those letters, in some ways, mean the most to me because you’re persuading skeptics. But even if you haven’t persuaded them on the issues, at least maybe they’ve recognized that I’ve tried to be true to the meaning of this office, that I’ve held it in reverence. But it’s worth mentioning that   a lot of letters I get, a lot of the letters I get that are most meaningful are really simple. It might be a senior citizen who is complaining about not having gotten a cost of living adjustment on Social Security and will just list out their budget for the month, and giving you sort of a vivid picture of how hard it is to get by. It might be a kid after a shooting like Newtown saying ”I’m scared.” And sometimes it’s just a family that’s writing to say, ”You know what? We have concerns, and things are tough, but, you know what, we’re resilient and we love each other and we think we’re going to make it, and we hope you stay at it, and we hope you’re hearing us.” Mr. President, thanks for these conversations. I’ve appreciated them very much and I know many of our listeners have as well. I appreciate it very much. After the conversation, Obama returned to the room to say one more thing about the CIA. You had something you wanted to add. When we’re discussing the issue of the Russia hack, I think it is worth noting that when it comes to the motivations of the Russians, that there are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies. And so when I receive a final report, you know, we’ll be able to I think give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations. But that does not in any way I think detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately that in fact what the Russian hack had done was create more problems for the Clinton administra  —   the Clinton campaign than it had for the Trump campaign. I think you’re stopping short of endorsing the CIA conclusion that the hack was designed to help Donald Trump as opposed to some other objective. Well I think the point I’m making is that right now what you’ve had are CIA leaks, not of an official document. And I think it’s important for the process of various agencies comparing notes and thinking about these assessments. Because it’s not as if in any of these circumstances, you know you just have a signed letter regarding Russian intentions that’s floating around. These are all assessments made based on a wide range of evidence and different agencies are still looking at all that stuff gathering it together and hopefully putting into a single package. That’s precisely why I’ve asked that report to be issued before the 20th so that those aspects of at least that are not classified can be presented in some form to the public. Those aspects of it that are classified can be presented as we’ve consistently done on a bipartisan basis to the members of Congress and the relevant committees."
"NPR’s national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly sat down for a   interview Thursday with CIA Director John Brennan at CIA headquarters in northern Virginia. Kelly asked about Russian interference in the U. S. election, how the CIA views   Donald Trump and the future of Syria. Brennan also shared some of his plans for his   life. (Hint: He won’t be writing a spy thriller). MARY LOUISE KELLY: Let me start with Russia. The White House has ordered a review, and I respect that you don’t want to get out ahead of that. I also respect that you cannot get into details of evidence that’s classified. But a    question: Do you, as head of the CIA, stand by the October statement that represented the consensus of U. S. intelligence, that Russia tried to interfere with the U. S. election? CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN: Absolutely. Yes I do. You do? I do. That same statement also said only Russia’s   officials could have authorized this interference. And the statement used the word ”confident,” that U. S. intelligence is confident in those things, which is a word I know that you all don’t use lightly. You’ve seen the intelligence those of us in the public have not. But can you say hand over heart that you’ve seen it and it’s solid? Well, I can say that the statement that was issued by [Homeland Security] Secretary [Jeh] Johnson, as well as DNI [Director of National Intelligence James] Clapper, was one that was very carefully considered. Going out publicly with that in early October, the month before the election, we wanted to make sure that there was full confidence in the language in there in terms of the responsibility for those compromises, as well as the intention to interfere with the election. So we stand by it today. We are following through with the president’s request to do a thorough and rigorous and comprehensive review. The president wants that to make sure that we understand fully what happened, what we need to learn from this experience, as well as to make sure that the incoming administration appreciates the extent of the concern that I think we as a government have, this administration has, about the opportunities for   in that digital domain. And I think this most recent experience with the Russian activities during this election really underscores the importance of making sure that we as a government take the appropriate steps to protect and safeguard our way of life as well as the tenets of our current democratic process. You mentioned the importance of making sure that the incoming administration understands the seriousness of what happened. How significant is that to you, and to what extent do you think they don’t get it yet? Well, it’s critically important to me, both as the current head of the CIA as well as when I was down at the White House, my responsibility was homeland security. And over the last eight years, I think the Obama administration really has tried to take steps to safeguard that environment because this country’s national security, as well as our prosperity, really rests on what we can do to secure that digital domain. And we want to make sure that the next administration, I want to make sure that my successor, and Mike Pompeo has been designated to be   Trump’s nominee, that they are able to take the baton that we have been running with for the past eight years and do everything possible to protect the government’s networks, databases and systems, but also to protect this country’s systems. So I think it is very important, and I think there are some people who are going to be coming into the administration who are unfamiliar with the extent of the threat, the nature of it, how diverse it is, as well as unfamiliar with the intelligence capabilities. And so we have a special responsibility and obligation to make sure that they are as informed, as enlightened, as knowledgeable as possible, because they have the responsibility to protect this country’s future. The White House has also said they’d like to make as much public as possible. And as you know, just saying ”Hey, we’ve seen it, we’re the CIA, trust us” doesn’t cut it in 2016. People want to see the evidence for themselves. How much will you be able to make public of what you know? I believe that this administration is going to try to inform the American people as much as possible about what happened, what the nature of that threat is and continues to be. There needs to be appropriate consideration given to the protection of information that will allow us to continue to monitor and prevent these types of attacks. So I think it’s always a balance when you need to go out publicly with information, optimize what it is that you’re able to push out publicly, but at the same time, protect that which needs to be protected. I’ve been told in this particular case, it’s proving even trickier than usual in your line of work  —   the sourcing issue and how much you can put out there, make public without compromising sensitive sources. Well, I think this is something that is a challenge for us on a number of fronts when we’re talking about the digital environment and capabilities, that we have to see and prevent and take steps against these types of attacks and exploitations. So there is, you know, there are technical issues. There are a whole host of intelligence capabilities that we need to make sure that are going to continue to thrive in the future. And that’s what I think, I know that Jim Clapper, Jim Comey, myself . .. . .. that’s the FBI director and the director of national intelligence . .. Right, and President Obama, they all want to be able to again optimize that which we can share publicly but optimize as well the continued capabilities of intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security to carry out their responsibilities. You mentioned the FBI director and the director of national intelligence. And NPR confirmed with three sources that after the three of you meeting last week, you sent a memo to your workforce and that the memo read: There is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature and intent of Russian interference in our presidential elections. Is that an accurate quote from your memo? I certainly believe that, that there is strong consensus. Was there ever not? Well, sometimes in the media, there is claims, allegations, speculation about differences of view. Sometimes I think that just feeds concerns about, you know, the strength of that intelligence and . .. And in this case it was reports of tension between FBI and CIA . .. . .. and differences of view. And I want to make sure that our workforce is kept as fully informed as possible so that they understand that what we’re doing, we’re doing in close coordination with our partners in the intelligence community. And so I try to keep my workforce informed on a periodic basis. But aside from whatever message I might have sent out to the workforce, there is, I strongly believe, very strong consensus among the key players  —   but not just the leaders of these organizations, but also the institutions themselves. And that’s why we’re going through this review. We want to make sure that we scrub this data, scrub the information and make sure that the assessment and analysis is as strong and as grounded as it needs to be. That quote I read you about the memo that you sent mentioned that there is agreement on scope, nature and intent of Russian interference. And intent is the one that’s been controversial recently, the question of motive. How confident are you in the intelligence on that? It seems like proving motive is an infinitely harder thing than proving that somebody did something. The ”why” is tough. I will not disagree with you that the why is tough. And that’s why there needs to be very careful consideration of what it is that we know, what it is that we have insight into and what our analysis needs to be. But even back in early October when Jim Clapper and Jeh Johnson put out this statement, it said ”the intent to interfere in the election.” Now, there are different elements that could be addressed in terms of how it wanted to interfere. And so that’s why this review is being done to make sure that there is going to be a thorough look at the nature, scope and intent of what transpired. What’s been reported is that the CIA has concluded the intent was to interfere with the election with the purpose of swinging at Donald Trump. Is that an accurate characterization? That’s an accurate characterization of what’s been appearing in the media. Yes. Is it an accurate characterization of where the CIA is on this? Well, that’s what the review is going to do. And we will be as   as the intelligence and analysis allows us to be, and we will make sure that, again, President Obama and the incoming administration understands what the intelligence community has assessed and determined to have happened during the   to this election. Why not confirm that that’s where the CIA is on this? Why not confirm if you have the evidence that you believe is . .. Because I don’t work for NPR, Mary Louise. I work for the president, I work for the administration, and it is my responsibility to give them the best information and judgment possible. I have been keeping the administration, senior administration, the president informed about this for several months. I have had numerous interactions with the Congress on this as well. And those are my principal obligations, and now that there has been this request by the president, or direction, to do this report, and there will be things to release to the public whenever that is done. I will be happy to talk to you about it then. Fair enough. I don’t know if I would be happy to talk to you about then, but I’m willing to talk to you about it then. Thank you. We’ll take you up on that. The president, President Obama, in an interview with NPR last week, said, and I’m quoting him, ”we will” respond to Russian interference. And I’m curious, I realize that’s a policy issue, I realize you don’t do policy, but you, in an interview recently with the BBC, said the U. S. should not stoop to their level. Meaning should not stoop to Russia’s level, should not respond in kind to Russian interference. Why not? Well, again, it is a decision that this president and or the next president will take as far as how to respond to what we have seen. But what are the concerns you have in terms of responding in kind? Well, this country is based on the democratic principles that our nation was founded upon. And there is a lot of challenges throughout the world to those principles of freedom, liberty, freedom of speech and the will of the people in order to govern as they see fit. And the election process is one of those foundational elements of our democracy. And I individually believe that there are certain things that this government, our country, should not be engaged in because it is inconsistent with those precepts, those tenets of the United States of America. So this was what’s making, you know, this challenging, which is how to safeguard our system, safeguard our digital domain, and make sure that there are decisions that can be taken that will deter, maybe sometimes punish those who violate the law, as well as try to attack our national security and try to undermine the democracy that we are. So that’s why the intelligence input to President Obama and   Trump is going to be very critically important in terms of making those decisions that are going to be, I think, very consequential in terms of what we might see in the future along these lines. Help me understand. Connect that line for me. How would retaliating in kind  —   so, a cyberattack against Russia  —   how would that undermine American democratic principles? Well, I think if we hold dear the principles of democracy, liberty, freedom and freedom of speech and the right of people everywhere to have governments of their choosing, preventing the conduct of a free and fair and open election, devoid of interference and foreign manipulation, is something that I think the United States government, as well as the American people, would certainly want to make sure that’s going to be who we are. And so there are a lot of things that those adversaries, enemies that we have, whether they be terrorists or proliferators or . .. whomever.  . They do some things that I think are beyond the pale. That’s why I don’t think we should resort to some of the tactics and techniques that our adversaries employ against us. I think we need to remember what we’re fighting for. We’re fighting for our country, our democracy, our way of life, and to engage in the skulduggery that some of our opponents and adversaries engage in, I think, is beneath this country’s greatness. It’s interesting because you’re speaking to the rules of cyberwarfare. Are there clear rules? It seems as though the U. S. is playing one game and an adversary like Russia is playing by entirely different rules. Well, that’s a good point, that there are no  —   well, there are international norms and standards that are adhered to mainly and endorsed by governments. And there are a lot of things that are being done by   or groups or individuals that are inconsistent with those norms and standards. But given that the digital domain does not respect sovereign boundaries and therefore is not subject to legal enforcement by individual governments, it makes it quite challenging. But I do believe that we can look at ways to protect this country’s future prosperity and security in that digital domain without having to resort to those types of activities that, again, are inconsistent with who we are as a people. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have powerful capabilities. I’m not saying we shouldn’t do some things in the digital domain, in the cyber domain. We do have tremendous capability. But I don’t think, and it’s something that if I were to be asked either as a policymaker or as a private citizen  —   should this country engage in manipulating foreign elections?  —   I would say absolutely not. We need to make sure that we are going to lead the way when it comes to allowing countries and people to choose their leaders, free of that foreign interference. And that’s the concerns we have, as we’ve seen, not just the United States but in other countries as well, the hand of foreign actors. And I don’t think it’s a secret that the the Russians have tried to influence the outcome of elections in other countries as well. So this is not just a question of their cyber activity. It’s a question of their using their influence in ways that are inconsistent, I believe, with what should be happening in these countries’ electoral processes. And you said the U. S. should not be involved in trying to influence the outcome of elections in other countries? I do not believe we should be involved in trying to influence the outcome of elections in foreign countries. That’s not something you would have heard everybody who’s occupied your position here at CIA saying over the decades. Maybe. And I think certainly in the 21st century this is something that the United States . .. The U. S. hasn’t tried to interfere and influence the outcome of any election in the 21st century? To my knowledge, no. That is something that certainly this president and I think even the last president, last administration and administrations before that. Encouraging participation, trying to make sure that people do have the opportunity and the right to vote in elections and that those electoral systems and campaigns are done without that foreign interference, yes, that’s something we encourage. But as far as trying to influence the outcome and to shape the outcome so that a preferred candidate emerges on top, no, that is something that this administration and, I can say, in previous administrations as well  —   I’m not going to go back into the far reaches of U. S. history, but I will say that what it is that we are trying to do today, is to make sure that people everywhere are able to experience the fruits of democracy. You mentioned the incoming administration and the importance of their understanding all of the intelligence that exists and that is out there.   Trump, we are told, has gotten a couple of intelligence briefings this week, but he has declined the tradition, the recent tradition at least, of getting a daily intelligence briefing in the   to the inauguration. And he and his incoming national security adviser have been dismissive of, I think safe to say even scornful of, the CIA. Why should   Trump trust the CIA? Well, I think the the CIA has a rich history of being able to inform, enlighten our leaders, our policymakers. And I do think that a number of people who would be coming into the administration, some have distant history as far as being part of the government. Some never were in the government before. So I believe it’s our solemn obligation as CIA officers to make sure that all of our new administration officials, from   Trump and Vice President Pence on down and national security   Mike Flynn, that they understand the breadth and depth of our capabilities. And I’ve told our people here at CIA: You have a solemn obligation to carry out your statutory responsibilities to inform and enlighten the   members of this government and making sure that the CIA carries out its responsibilities in terms of our responsibilities for clandestine collection,   analysis, counterintelligence, covert action, liaison engagements across the range of responsibilities. And we need to make sure that we’re able to educate the people that are coming into the government. This is the time for CIA officers to shine, and I’ve told them to look upon this as an opportunity. And I have not had any conversations with the   Trump or Mike Flynn about their views on intelligence. And I do believe that they will appreciate the value of that intelligence if they don’t already. And I believe that, with more exposure, they will understand just how important our work is and how much we can help them succeed in terms of what this country needs to do over the next four years at least. It sounds like you’re saying Donald Trump doesn’t get what the CIA can do yet, but he will. I think it’s very difficult for anybody outside of the government, outside of those who have knowledge of the intelligence community, to really appreciate what it is that we do and understand. There’s a lot of misperceptions about what the agency does, based on some media reports and movies and other things, that there needs to be a process whereby they can absorb what our capabilities are, the expertise. We have some of the world’s greatest experts on so many issues, and I cannot be prouder of the people in the agency. And as I’ve told them, you’re going to have the opportunity to really impress a new group of people and really have them better understand the challenges, the threats, the opportunities that are out there. So I don’t look upon the incoming administration as one that is not going to absorb intelligence. I look upon the new administration as one that is going to be thirsty for this inside information, because a lot of it is going to be very new to them. So I think people are energized and are looking forward to the opportunity to talk to a new administration. Do you have any insight into why they haven’t been thirsty yet for the insights? I wouldn’t say they’re not thirsty. There are continual briefings and meetings, and having been part of the transition team for    Obama, that period of time between Election Day and Inauguration Day is full of things to do in terms of picking senior people and just getting, you know, your organization ready to move from a campaign and a winning ticket to a new administration. So I think there are only a certain number of hours in the day, and I’m not going to presume that I know all of the things that the incoming team were trying to accomplish. But I am confident that over time, there’s going to be a rich appreciation of what it is that the CIA and our intelligence community colleagues bring to our national security. I’d love to let you respond to two pieces of criticism. One is that the Trump transition team has pushed back hard against some CIA judgments. They released a statement saying, and I’m quoting, ”These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” Do they have a point? They haven’t said anything to me or to CIA directly. That was a public statement though. Well, I’m sure that this is part of their perception of what CIA has done in the past. But the CIA got it wrong on Iraq. Well, you know, the intelligence community did not call it 100 percent accurate in the   to the Iraq War. So why should they trust you now? Well, because there are many, many, many, many things that the CIA has in fact done and has called correctly. We don’t have a perfect record. I understand that. And I will, if I have the opportunity to talk to the incoming team, I will talk to them about some of the things that we really are quite proud of and do. But intelligence is both a science and an art, and there are some things that we know with certainty, some things that we infer, some things that we assess, but sometimes the truth can be quite elusive. And yes, there have been times in the past where we fell short. But I can point out numerous occasions when this agency did save lives, kept this country safe, and we as Americans should be quite proud of what legions of agency officers have done over our history. The other criticism of late has been that the CIA has waded in to politics in a way that it shouldn’t. And I want to let you respond to a quote. This is from Republican Congressman Pete King, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, who says you should be  —   you, personally, John Brennan  —   should be investigated for orchestrating a ”hit job” on Donald Trump. Do you personally, does the CIA as an agency, are you orchestrating a hit job on Donald Trump? Do you have an ax to grind with the  ? Ah, Peter King. He’s somebody who I’ve had, you know, many engagements over the years. I must say he is a great politician, and he is really quite skilled in these types of political fulminations and has been quite active in many respects. I’ve had   with them over the years and also have had very good conversations with him. So I think as a very strong partisan, in many respects, I think he is doing what many politicians will do at times like this, which is to try to defend, if not attack, those that he believes are challenging maybe his colleagues and party or whatever but . .. You don’t think he means it? Oh, well, he, I think, again, he is quite skilled in hyperbole as well as these soundbites. And Peter King is somebody who I respect and admire his political skills, but  —   and he can investigate me, that’s fine. I am very, very confident that the CIA carried out its responsibilities very well. And I am happy to talk to members of Congress who might want to ask me questions about our role. To his broader point, because he’s not the only person who’s raised it: Does the CIA have it in for Donald Trump? [laughs] We are apolitical. We are nonpartisan. We serve our policymakers and our presidents irrespective of political party, and we try to carry out our duties to the best of our ability. And so we have it out for no one except this country’s adversaries and enemies. And if you’re an adversary and enemy of this country, you should be afraid of CIA because we will work to thwart your aims. But if you are a member of this government, and if you are a   American, you should have great pride in what it is that we do. So we certainly do not have it out for any administration or any senior official or the incoming president. You mentioned Mike Pompeo who, if he’s confirmed, will be your successor as director of the CIA. Has he reached out to you? Have you started briefing him on . .. ? I have, I have known Mike Pompeo, Congressman Pompeo from Kansas, because he’s on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the HPSCI, the oversight committee. I have met with him a number of times. I have talked to him . .. Since he was nominated? Oh, yes, absolutely. And in fact I have spoken to him this week a couple of times. I want to make sure that the CIA is doing what we need to do in order to ensure that his process for confirmation goes along smoothly and he is working that. And he is not presuming confirmation, so he is doing the absolute right thing in terms of focusing on that upcoming hearing. But he is somebody who, when I’ve spoken to him, he’s excited, he’s humbled by the opportunity, he recognizes that this is a tremendous organization and he would consider it a great, great honor to have the opportunity to lead the women and men of CIA. And as long as I’m director of CIA here, I’ll make sure that we continue to run with the baton up until Inauguration Day. And I look forward to being able to hand this baton off to somebody who is as dedicated American as Mike Pompeo is, a former military officer and a serving member of Congress and somebody who is savoring the opportunity to come here to CIA. Also someone who has expressed very strong political views  —   appropriate for a congressman, less so for a CIA director. I was struck by statements the two of you both made recently on Iran. You, in an interview, said it would be the height of folly to roll back the nuclear deal. And Mike Pompeo was tweeting the day before he was nominated, saying, calling the nuclear deal ”disastrous” and that he looked forward to rolling back. Safe to say you two have a different world view on certain things? Safe to say that we, if we were in different positions at the time. As an intelligence official, I will speak my mind about what I see as threats to U. S. national security. Mike Pompeo, as a congressman from Kansas and as a politician, I think he serves his constituency as well as his political leanings well. He is outspoken, which is, which is good. But I think he recognizes that, as a politician, he has the absolute right to take political stances on issues, just the way I as an intelligence official have every right to take positions on national security issues, which I do. So the fact that we may not have said the same thing, I think, is a reflection of the different positions that we hold. Will he need to park those strong world views when he comes in as CIA director and his task is to provide objective intelligence and information to the president, particularly when it may not be the exact intelligence and advice that the president wants to hear? And I’m sure that Mike will enjoy talking to you as much as I enjoy talking to you about these issues when he comes in. Greatly, then. But I think he certainly recognizes the difference between being a congressman from Kansas and being the director of CIA. You think he gets that. Oh, absolutely. He is a West Point graduate. He is a   lawyer, a member of Congress, and he recognizes that if he has the great honor to raise his right hand and swear an oath of allegiance to his country as CIA director, that he has statutory responsibilities that he needs to carry out to the best of his ability, and that is to make sure that the CIA and the director of CIA fulfills their apolitical, nonpartisan role to make sure they carry out the CIA’s mission. During your time here, you launched some of the most sweeping reforms in the history of the CIA, creating missions where you have spies and analysts working side by side, focused on certain regions and topics. You created a new Directorate for Digital Innovation, to beef up CIA’s technical and cyber capabilities. As you speak to your incoming successor, Mike Pompeo, is your sense that he will leave those changes in place? Well, I felt a special responsibility since I served 25 years in CIA to do what I could here on the organizational front to make sure that we’re postured well for the future. I’ve talked to Mike about the modernization program we have underway here. He is very familiar with it. I briefed his committee many times. I told him that to me, the modernization process should never end because we have to constantly adapt to the realities that we have to deal with in the outside world. And my recommendation to Mike was to, when he comes here, get to know the place as best he can. This is a large organization, a complex organization, but a very powerful organization. I’m sure during the course of his tenure, he will look at things just the way I did and say, you know, we need to adjust this or tweak that. I believe, though, that if this agency is going to fulfill its mission to the best of its ability, we need to take full advantage of the great expertise and capabilities and tools and authorities we have. And that   construct is one that integrates it. I think Mike, as a military officer, I think will see that there are some similarities between what we did and what the military did as far as forming those combatant commands so that you have the benefit of Marines, Air Force, Army, Navy brought together. So I’m confident that this integration model is going to continue in the future. But I’m also pretty confident that there will be subsequent adjustments, as there need to be, as the agency continues to adapt to the evolving nature of the world environment. Let me turn you to one of the regions of the world that I know has occupied a lot of your time and will presumably occupy Mike Pompeo’s as well, and that’s Syria, which you have described is the most complex situation you have ever had to grapple with . .. . .. and the most heartbreaking, too, for me. Why the most complex? I think the heartbreaking thing is obvious to all of us. Complex because there are so many internal actors and external actors involved. There are also a number of competing interests and objectives. There is such a variety of confessional groups, of ethnic groups, of individuals who adhere to different religious faiths. And it’s all brought together in that area, and it’s made also more complex by the fact that you have an authoritarian leader in Bashar Assad, who seems to have no compulsion against using weapons of war to kill, maim and injure countless number of Syrian civilians. But you also have then the involvement of Iran and Hezbollah and Russia that have brought to bear their capabilities inside of Syria, and you have terrorist organizations like ISIL and also like Jabhat     in Syria, that have taken advantage of a lot of the political vacuums that have occurred as well as just the fighting. So it’s become a cauldron of activity of individuals and groups that have their own individual agendas and objectives. We are trying to make sure that the Syrian people can emerge from this experience with a political process that’s going to give them the government they deserve, that’s going to truly represent all the various groups inside Syria, while the same time trying to crush and destroy terrorists that are thriving right now and in many parts of the country. So there are competing objectives, and sometimes these objectives are, U. S. objectives, are in direct tension with one another, which really makes this so complicated. One new twist seems to be what’s being described as perhaps a new constellation of power in the region: Iran, Russia, Turkey. There were   talks this week. The U. S. was not invited. How much insight do you have into that axis, or would you even describe it that way? Well, I think there certainly have been discussions and talks that are going on among them. I think in some areas they have complimentary interests and objectives. I think there are areas also where they disagree. And I think sometimes that the Russians will try to take advantage of tactical opportunities that may exist to forge some agreements and alliances. But I do think that over time, those three countries alone are not going to be able to resolve the problems in that region. But I do see that some of the actors, for a variety of reasons, are seeking to form alliances to see whether or not they can advance their common objectives. But also, I see that there is going to be real conflict among them on some other elements of this problem. Because the   goals don’t align?   goals as well as, there are  —   again, some of the players that are inside the country are aligned with some of those states and not with others. And sometimes the proxies that they try to work with will have their own agendas that will, I think, disrupt some of their benefactors’ objectives. So this is a very dynamic situation right now. Things are going to continue to move, and I think over the next several months, we’re going to continue to see, unfortunately, a lot of violence and bloodshed. So I think there will be a number of false starts on solutions. But this cannot be resolved in the battlefield. This insurgency inside of Syria is not going to go away. Even if the terrorist groups are crushed, there are many Syrians that have had their lives torn asunder by Bashar Assad, and they’re not going to stop until he is out of power. And I think his getting out of power is going to be really the first step toward Syria’s future. I was going to ask you. It looks as though this week we’re seeing the battle for Aleppo drawing to a close, and I was going to ask: Do you see that as the beginning of the end of conflict in Syria? It sounds like the answer is a firm no. No, I don’t believe so. What we see is the deliberate attempts to exterminate the opposition forces that were in Aleppo and there were some terrorists that were there. The destruction of Aleppo really has been an awful, awful demonstration of sort of a   policy on the part of the regime as well as the Russians, and to many Syrians, men, women and children, have died there. And unfortunately there are many individuals who are now trying to figure out where they go next. They are allowed to leave Aleppo. But as you know, they go up maybe toward Idlib, is that going to be the next phase of what the regime is doing to try to exterminate the opposition? So, yes, there were some of the members of the terrorist groups that were in Aleppo, but the overwhelming number of opposition there were part of what was the Free Syrian Army. So Aleppo’s destruction, Aleppo’s fall, to me is not a sign that there is going to be an end to this conflict, because I am convinced that many, many of those oppositionists  —   the ones who are trying to reclaim their country for their families, for their neighbors, for their children  —   will continue to fight. So this insurgency is not going to go away until there is some type of viable and genuine political process that will bring to power in Damascus a government that is representative of the Syrian people and really will try to repair and recover from this awful war. [EDITOR’S NOTE: The batteries in the recorder died at the end of this answer, so the question was   at the end of the interview. For concision, we have combined the two answers in this transcript.] One more on Syria. One of the questions put to President Obama at his White House news conference last week was about Syria, and it was specifically whether he felt any personal moral responsibility for what was going on in Aleppo, and he said he did. I want to put the same question to you. The CIA is involved in that conflict in ways that you can acknowledge publicly, and in ways that I know you won’t. But do you feel any personal moral responsibility for, as you said, that the heartbreak that we see happening there? I certainly feel a connection with Syria, the Syrian people. It’s a country that I traveled to a number of times, and I just see the devastation of the people, of the landscape, of the ancient cities. So I think, you know, we all who are involved, in one form or another, certainly feel that connection. We feel some responsibility. I think we always like to say that we wish that we would have been able to make a difference in a way that would have prevented the slide and the situation there. So there’s no way you can divorce yourself, emotionally or mentally, from these situations that you play a role in. We also have to recognize, though, that as great a country, as powerful a country as the United States is, we have, in many areas, limited ability to influence the course of events. And you try things and you hope and you plan and you strategize. But there are a lot of factors, a lot of variables, a lot of unforeseen developments as well as actions. And then it comes down to some decisions that need to be made as far as what’s the extent, the nature of U. S. engagement and whether or not certain policy decisions are really in keeping with what our national security demands. And these are really tough, tough calls. And when I was down the White House and I was a policymaker, a part of that policy circle, these are issues that you really agonized over. And I know that President Obama has agonized over them. And when we meet in the Situation Room, we look at a lot of these challenges and what does the, what can the United States do and what type of commitment we want to make, whether it be on the economic side or on the military side or on the intelligence side. There are a lot of factors that go into that ultimate decision. Opportunity costs, as well as if you take certain steps, what does that mean as far as the   steps and actions that might be required? So these are tough, tough calls. In the case of the CIA, those steps have involved helping to arm some of the moderate rebels as  —   as defined by CIA. Has the CIA gotten that balance right? They’ve been armed to the extent that they can continue fighting, not armed enough to win decisively. The United States government has provided support both political as well as other types of assistance to elements of the opposition. And I will not address what CIA may or may not be doing. I know there’s a lot of things that are out there in the media. But I will say that there are thousands of these fighters, the opposition, who want to reclaim their country and are looking for support from the outside because they recognize that fighting against one of the largest Arab armies, the Syrians, along with Hezbollah, a formidable paramilitary military force, Iran, as well as Russia. And that overwhelming firepower against opposition fighters who are lightly armed and are again trying to protect their families, their villages, their neighborhoods without external supports, they are just overpowered. They’ve done a remarkable job, I think, in terms of trying to prevent Bashar from just overrunning the country. But if I may, I’ll put the question again: Has the U. S. provided the right amount of support? I think it’s clear that the opposition has not had the type of capability necessary to push back against the regime and   forces that have come to bear. And so these opposition forces get their support from a number of quarters. And it’s clear that that type of support was coming from the outside has been insufficient to prevent the fall of Aleppo, to prevent the fall of some other areas. So that’s what the, you know, the opposition has looked for is that external support that they need to go up against these are overwhelming odds. One other place in the world that I want to ask you about: North Korea. Where does North Korea and its nuclear ambitions rank in the list of things that keep you awake at night? It is certainly in the top five. What would be the others, if I may? [laughs] Well, I have about 20 or 30 other things that are in the top five that compete. [laughs] OK. There are a lot of ties there. But North Korea, given that Kim Jong Un has demonstrated, I think, some real irresponsibility and continued march toward having a nuclear weapons program with ballistic missile capability that could not just threaten regional states but also this country. I think this is something that needs to be at the forefront of the security agenda of the next administration. It has certainly been on this administration’s agenda. And so we cannot allow, in my mind, this situation in North Korea to continue its current trajectory, because there is just, I think, real potential for his destabilizing actions in the region that threaten our security interests in that region but also can threaten our homeland as well. What might change North Korea’s trajectory? It’s described as the land of lousy policy options. Yes. Well, I think we’ve worked with China, and I think China also recognizes that North Korea is a problem. I think it stands in China’s way of accomplishing a number of Beijing’s objectives in terms of its regional relations as well as relations with the United States. I do think ultimately it’s going to be up to the United States, along with China, South Korea, Japan and others, to have a united front when it comes to North Korea, making sure there’s a united international front in terms of the sanctions and actions that can be taken against North Korea. Hopefully, the people of North Korea will recognize that Kim Jong Un is just trying to perpetuate his reign and rule at their expense. The impoverishment of the North Korean people is something that is awful. And his continued dumping of resources into military programs when he should be trying to feed his people is really something that I think the entire international community should address and do with tougher sanctions and tougher measures. But China has to be part of that. The current assessment is that North Korea, if it continues at its current pace, could have a nuclear armed missile capable of hitting the continental U. S. within the next five years. Is that right? The course that it’s on is a worrisome one because it’s made very clear its intention to continue its nuclear program as well as its continued development of ballistic missile capability of various ranges including intercontinental. Is that time frame, five years, is that roughly right? Well, whenever we make these determinations, assessments of that, a lot of factors have to be taken into account. There are issues related to the reliability of certain weapon systems. But I think that if Kim Jong Un has even a small percent chance of being able to deliver a nuclear weapon to other states or this homeland, to me, that’s a greater percent than we should allow to continue. Last point on North Korea. Dennis Wilder, who used to work for you here at CIA, also has worked on North Korea at the White House, he told me that his biggest concern is that right now North Korea has enough fissile material for about 10 to 20 nuclear weapons but that at their current rate of development, by 2020 they could have enough for 50. The danger being they would have surplus, they would have enough to export. How worrying is that? We are concerned about North Korea’s nuclear program, and we keep the president and Congress fully informed about our assessments about their nuclear capability stockpile, as well as their ballistic missile capabilities and developments. So as I said, the trajectory that North Korea is on is one that I think needs to be disrupted, because they continue to try to acquire greater capability. And there needs to be some way for this situation to be resolved. Not advocating any type of military solution to this. I’ve said I hope that Kim Jong Un, with external pressure, is going to realize that the path he’s on is one that is not going to give North Korea the type of of support and assistance that it needs. It does not have the ability to feed its people. It needs to be able to correct that course, and he sees military capability as being the key to getting that type of recognition and respect and assistance. It’s not. It’s getting him the opprobrium of the international community. And I think that the pressure on North Korea, in terms of sanctions and other types of actions, is only destined to increase in the future. Is there a Stuxnet for North Korea? [laughs] Next question. [laughs] Well, if we got this far into the interview and that’s the first ”no comment,” I think we’re doing all right. What’s your plan for the morning of Jan. 21? Sleep. Sleep. That’s the thing you miss? It’s the thing, you know, I say that sleep is overrated. But these are tough jobs, and I’m looking forward to reintroducing myself to my family, spending time with them, maybe reintroducing myself to American culture and reading some books that don’t have anything to do with intelligence and national security. Or seeing some movies. I understand that there are still movie theaters out there. So there are some things that I haven’t had the opportunity to do, after 36 years or so of being in this profession, one that I absolutely love and cherish. And this is the ultimate capstone of my career. I could never see doing another government job, because no government job can come anywhere close to being director of CIA. What’s the first book on your nightstand that you’re going to get to? I don’t know, I’m going to sort of wander through a bookstore and to see what is out there. I do want to do something that is very different than what I have been doing right now, just from an intellectual stimulation standpoint. Maybe write some fiction. I know that you are a very accomplished author of fiction. Thank you. I have a couple of ideas and, you know, that I would be able to . .. Really? Maybe a spy thriller then. Not a spy thriller. It’ll be something else. We’ll see. I will look forward to reading it. Director Brennan, thank you. Thank you, Mary Louise. And thank you for your interest in national security and these interviews that we’ve conducted over the years. I presume that this will be the last one that I’ll have the opportunity to talk to you as a government official. Thank you. I thank you for your time. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas."
" In an annex at the headquarters of Chesapeake Energy Corp, a unit informally known as AKM Operations manages a top company priority: the personal business of its namesake, Chief Executive Aubrey K. McClendon. According to internal documents reviewed by Reuters, the unit’s accountants, engineers and supervisors handled about $3 million of personal work for McClendon in 2010 alone. Among other tasks, the unit’s controller once helped coordinate the repair of a McClendon house that was damaged by hailstones. Fourteen miles south, at Will Rogers World Airport, Chesapeake leases a fleet of planes that shuttle executives to oil and gas fields    and the McClendon family to holiday destinations. On one trip, the clan took flights to Amsterdam and Paris that cost $108, 000; McClendon counted the trip as a business expense. In another case, Chesapeake logs show, nine female friends of McClendon’s wife flew to Bermuda in 2010 without any McClendons aboard. The cost: $23, 000. Closer to home, McClendon pursues another of his passions: the Oklahoma City Thunder, the NBA franchise in which he owns a 19 percent stake. As with other assets, McClendon has melded his Thunder interest with Chesapeake business. The energy company signed a $36 million sponsorship deal, and it pays up to $4 million annually to brand the stadium Chesapeake Energy Arena. What hasn’t been previously disclosed is that McClendon mortgaged his future proceeds from the team to secure two bank loans. The AKM unit, the jet flights and the Thunder relationship are part of the lavish but leveraged lifestyle that McClendon has built through Chesapeake, America’s   natural gas producer. From the   corporate campus that he shaped with a meticulous eye for detail, McClendon has intertwined his personal financial interests with those of the publicly traded corporation he runs to a far greater degree than shareholders may realize, according to interviews, public records and hundreds of pages of internal Chesapeake documents reviewed by Reuters. McClendon, 52, has put longtime friends on the Chesapeake board and showered them with compensation. Restaurants he has   occupy buildings owned by the energy company. A Chesapeake executive has handled the CEO’s personal land and   and   transactions. Few outsiders are privy to the sophisticated universe of services that Chesapeake provides McClendon. The existence and scope of AKM Operations, for instance, hasn’t been previously reported. ”I have to be wary when I see this type of pattern of disregarding shareholders’ best interests,” said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management LLP, which owns about 1 million Chesapeake shares. ”I think McClendon should go.” Beyond the mixing of personal and professional, another theme emerges from interviews and records: McClendon’s seemingly insatiable desire to own more and more    of everything. Said a contemporary who knows McClendon well, ”If you’re competitive like Aubrey, you just always want to own more.” For Chesapeake, McClendon has overseen a spree of more than 100 real estate purchases in Oklahoma City in recent years worth more than $240 million, property records show. On land steps from the corporate campus, he directed his natural gas company to develop a luxury shopping center. Now, he’s planning to open a   grocery store. For himself, McClendon bought his neighbor’s house near Oklahoma City and then the one behind that. He acquired a mansion on ”billionaire’s row” in Bermuda and later added a larger estate. He bought properties in Minnesota and Maui and near Vail, Colorado. He filled cellars in three states with trophy wines, and purchased 16 antique boats valued at $9 million. Then McClendon mortgaged much of it    and bought more. ’MEDIA FIRESTORM’ Normally, McClendon loves publicity. When Forbes put his face on the cover last fall and declared him ”America’s Most Reckless Billionaire,” Chesapeake posted the story on its website. But these are not normal times for McClendon. In the wake of Reuters reports that raised questions about his mingling of personal and corporate interests, the board stripped him of his chairmanship. The company faces IRS and Securities and Exchange Commission inquiries, more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits, and demands for change from its largest investors. Meantime, the board is investigating ties between McClendon’s personal financial transactions and Chesapeake’s. Bowing to the pressure, Chesapeake said this week that four current board members will be replaced with new directors chosen by two top investors, activist Carl C. Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management. Along with a new independent chairman expected to be named later this month, the reconfigured board will effectively be controlled by shareholders    a shift expected to serve as a check on McClendon. Citing the lawsuits, McClendon declined to be interviewed for this story. In   however, he spoke to several hundred Chesapeake employees about the crisis. ”I encourage everybody to inhale,” McClendon said at one point, according to a partial recording of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. ”I’m fine. You’re fine. And we’re in the middle of a pretty unprecedented media firestorm today. I don’t exactly know the origins of it and I don’t exactly know when it ends, but I know that it will end, and we will emerge stronger. We will emerge more focused, and we will change in some ways that we probably need to change in.” In recent weeks, Reuters has reported that McClendon used his stakes in company wells to arrange $1. 55 billion in financing from a major financier of Chesapeake and others; that a Chesapeake board member lent money to McClendon; that he sold his share of at least two large energy plays at the same time Chesapeake divested its interest; and that he operated a private $200 million hedge fund from Chesapeake offices. ”You can pick up the paper every day and read something negative about me or about the company,” McClendon told his employees during the May meeting. ”I would not have wished the past month on my worst enemy.” ’MY WAY’ McClendon’s fate will have implications well beyond Chesapeake. He has been one of the most influential CEOs of his generation, credited and sometimes cursed for championing the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The controversial method has led to a vast boom in U. S.   production. That boom has reduced American reliance on foreign energy and enriched his company and his hometown. Using his own cash and Chesapeake’s, McClendon has helped rebrand Oklahoma City through philanthropy and real estate development. Once largely defined by a tragedy    the domestic terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995    the state capital is now emerging as a center of sports and culture. In no small part, that revitalization was fueled by McClendon’s vision and his commitment to the community and to Chesapeake. Subordinates say McClendon has four children    Will, Callie, Jack and Chesapeake. They are only partly joking. McClendon routinely works through weekends, and employees often wake to emails he has sent between midnight and dawn. He expects instant answers. ”He will ask me a question and push back when I hesitate,” said McClendon’s longtime architect, Rand Elliott. ”He’ll say, ‘Rand, what if we paint it blue?’ And I’ll say, ‘Let me think about it.’ He’ll insist, ‘No, I want you to give me an answer right now.’ I asked him once, ‘Aubrey, why do you need to know now? How is it you can make decisions so quickly?’ He said, ‘I make hundreds of decisions every day. I’ve gotten pretty good at it. And I think I hit 90 percent of them right. ’” McClendon is often portrayed as a visionary    a Mellon or Rockefeller of his time: Chesapeake’s geologists helped identify North American basins that may hold a   supply of natural gas. Yet those hefty reserves have pushed natural gas prices to among the lowest levels in a decade. The CEO takes the long view, projecting optimism and  . In his most recent annual statement to shareholders, McClendon used the word ”bold” 27 times to describe his stewardship of Chesapeake: ”We made the bold decision. ..” ”This is clearly a bold plan. ..” ”We accelerated the next bold move. ..” He’s also a      not necessarily meddlesome, employees and business associates say, but obsessed. No aspect of a project is too granular. He helped pick the kind of peanuts served at a restaurant he owns. He inserts commas into press releases and measures the distance between Redbud trees near his office. ”I’ll say, ‘I’d like all the tulips to be red,’” architect Rand recalled. ”He’ll say, ‘No, no, they’ve got to be multicolored. ’” Chesapeake is now a Fortune 500 company with 13, 400 employees. It has grown so big and McClendon has sold so much stock    dumping $569 million during a personal financial crisis in 2008    that he now owns less than 1 percent of the company. Yet in many ways he still runs Chesapeake the way he did when he   it with 10 employees in 1989. He meets every new Oklahoma City employee, in groups of 30 or 40, during an   session. He takes out a large advertisement in the local paper that includes the pictures of the new hires. McClendon also closely monitors their work, internal records show. Every six months he spends the bulk of a week in meetings to personally consider proposed bonus payments to hundreds of employees. The documents show the CEO gets briefed on matters as obscure as whether to discipline a mechanic in Texas who chronically complains to colleagues about his pay. To McClendon, ”every detail matters,” said his minister, the Reverend Patrick Bright. Leaving church one Sunday, McClendon spotted a   tree branch that posed a traffic hazard. ”Before I finished saying goodbye to everyone, I had an email from Aubrey,” the minister recalled. ”It was a picture of the branch sent from his phone.” Friends and colleagues say land is another preoccupation. Under McClendon’s direction, Chesapeake engaged in what the company described as a ”land grab” to dominate shale plays around the country. According to internal emails and former executives, Chesapeake began paying   prices to squeeze out competitors. At times, former employees said, McClendon was too quick to approve deals. ”He is very easy to pitch because his general inclination is to say ‘yes,’” said one former employee. ”It was really surprising. There weren’t a lot of questions.” Last fall, McClendon held forth on his business philosophy during a forum on ”creativity and conscious capitalism.” ”I’ve always been comfortable thinking things through and doing it, more or less, my way,” McClendon said. ”You can be as creative as you want, but if you’re   …     unwilling to work on the details, to see those put into action, then creativity is just dreams, or worse, hallucinations.” The tycoon added a wry joke. ”There are some areas in our business where creativity is not particularly welcome    for instance, if you’re an accountant.” TOM SAWYER With his warm face, rimless glasses and distinctive white mane, the athletic McClendon is sometimes mistaken for former NFL quarterback Archie Manning, the father of football superstars Peyton and Eli Manning. Like the Manning brothers, McClendon comes from a family of achievers. He is a great nephew of former Oklahoma Governor Robert Kerr,   of U. S.    pioneer   Corp. His wife, Katie, is a Whirlpool heiress, and her relative, Kate Upton, is a Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover model. ”To say that he grew up with a silver spoon is wrong,” said Chesapeake senior vice president Thomas S. Price Jr. a confidant. ”The implication is that he pulled the lever on the slot machine in life and   got lucky    and nothing could be further from the truth.” McClendon worked hard for everything he has accomplished, friends say, and his competitive drive emerged at an early age. He received his first business lesson as a teenager, mowing neighborhood lawns in suburban Oklahoma City, the friends say. McClendon competed against a boy named Shannon Self, and one day noticed that Self’s younger brother was cutting some of Self’s lawns. McClendon discovered that his competitor had   the work to his brother. Self was mowing more lawns and making more money than McClendon with less effort. ”He calls it his ’painting the fence’ story, the scene where Tom Sawyer gets his friends to whitewash the fence,” said a friend. The episode served as an early example of McClendon’s penchant for collecting smart and loyal friends and keeping them close. Self became a founding Chesapeake board member and remains a McClendon legal adviser. A review of proxy statements shows that from 1995 through 2005, while Self served as both a Chesapeake board member and a partner shareholder in successive law firms, those firms billed Chesapeake for $6. 3 million in legal work. Self retired from the board in 2005 with 232, 972 Chesapeake shares then worth $4. 8 million and another 288, 750 stock options. Self wasn’t the only board member to profit handsomely while supervising McClendon. Until just a few weeks ago, when pay and perks were curtailed in response to public scrutiny, the Chesapeake board was one of the most generously paid in the U. S. oil and gas industry, according to a review of proxy statements. From 2009 through 2011, Chesapeake paid $13. 3 million in total compensation to 10   board members. By comparison, Exxon Mobil, the world’s    company in 2011, paid 13   board members $9. 9 million during the same period. Though Self left the board in 2005, McClendon’s friend continued to exercise a perk bestowed on board members    flying on   aircraft. In 2009, logs show, Self flew with his family from Oklahoma City to the Grand Caymans. In total, Self and family members logged $150, 000 worth of personal flights on Chesapeake planes in 2010, records show. Self did not respond to requests for comment. Other Chesapeake board members were such frequent fliers in 2010 that some logged far more personal flights than business flights on   jets, internal documents show. Corporate plane use for business and personal flights is considered a prime perk for American executives and board members. It is legal if properly disclosed, though personal trips can be subject to income tax. Chesapeake discloses such travel but only for board members and a few top executives. It does not detail how many flights each individual took, or where and with whom the individual traveled. Reuters reviewed internal company logs, which list specific flights and include dates, airports and passenger lists. Board member Merrill ”Pete” Miller, for example, the chief executive of National Oilwell Varco and Chesapeake’s lead independent director, took $160, 000 in free personal flights    twice as much as he spent on business travel. Former Oklahoma governor and current board member Frank Keating spent $57, 000 in business flights, mostly to shuttle between Oklahoma and Washington, and $175, 000 worth of personal flights. A   flight with 10 friends to Alaska cost Chesapeake shareholders $71, 000. Miller did not respond to requests for comment. Keating referred questions to Chesapeake, which did not respond. WEEKENDS IN BERMUDA Even the board’s most frequent fliers cannot rival McClendon’s use of jets that the company leased. His contract permits him to take unlimited business or personal flights for free (though he must pay taxes for certain personal flights). Friends and family, the contract says, also fly for free. On June 15, 2010, a Gulfstream 550 jet leased by Chesapeake departed Oklahoma City bound for Amsterdam with three passengers: McClendon and his two sons, Jack, now 26, and Will, 19. McClendon gave a speech to a   conference shortly after arriving, then took the next two weeks off for a family vacation. According to logs reviewed by Reuters, the trio was joined by McClendon’s wife, Katie, and together the four flew back from Paris. The charter flights cost $108, 000 and were billed as ”business,” the logs show. The flights were among 155 business charters McClendon logged in 2010 at a cost of $2. 25 million. He brought family members along for at least 17 of those flights, billed as business expenses and valued at more than $370, 000. Chesapeake executives, board members and their families also take what the company characterizes as ”personal” flights. In 2010 the McClendons took at least 75 personal flights on   aircraft. The cost: an estimated $830, 000 to $875, 000. Although his contract affords him unlimited use of the jets for himself, his friends and his family, McClendon reimbursed the company $375, 000 for personal flights that year, according to a proxy. The McClendons took personal trips to Mexico, the Cayman Islands and New York. Bermuda, where the McClendons own vacation properties, was also a favored destination. One Friday in fall 2010, McClendon, his wife and a son flew to the island and flew back to Oklahoma City by Monday. Total cost: $34, 000. The following weekend, his wife and daughter jetted there. Total cost: $27, 000. Personal use of corporate jets has abated since the SEC imposed stricter reporting rules in 2006. Travel by relatives in particular has declined, said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at GMI Ratings, a   ratings firm, ”because the fierce light of disclosure is on them.” Chesapeake’s use of the perk appears relatively heavy, some experts said. The jet travel is an indicator of wider troubles at the company, said John Liu, the comptroller for New York City, which holds 1. 9 million shares of Chesapeake stock. ”It’s becoming clear that the excessive perks and problematic   deals that the company discloses, which have long caused concerns among investors, are only the tip of the iceberg,” Liu said. ”But, at this point, it’s no longer shocking given the company’s pattern of behavior.” AKM OPERATIONS McClendon’s personal business affairs are tracked in the   building on the fringe of Chesapeake’s corporate campus, where at least six company employees work. This is AKM Operations. Chesapeake regularly discloses that McClendon receives personal accounting and engineering support from company employees; his contract allows him to use company facilities for his ”personal businesses, investments and activities.” But the scope and sophistication of the support, including AKM Operations, is not broken out in public disclosures. In 2010, Chesapeake employees spent more than 15, 000 hours working on McClendon’s personal projects, according to internal records reviewed by Reuters. The cost: about $3 million. In 2011 the documents projected that Chesapeake employees would do about $3. 2 million in work for McClendon. The company keeps detailed records because McClendon’s contract calls for him to provide ”a partial reimbursement” of the salaries, benefits and indirect costs of the Chesapeake employees who are ”primarily designated to” work on his personal businesses. He does not reimburse the company for ”secretarial or general administrative support,” according to his contract. The agreement also calls for Chesapeake to pay a portion of the accounting and engineering work as part of McClendon’s annual compensation. In 2008 he received $708, 339 in both accounting and engineering support. In 2009 it totaled $685, 669, according to the proxies. In 2010 the company covered $250, 000. Given that the accountants and engineers provided an estimated $3 million worth of personal work to the CEO, McClendon would have owed Chesapeake about $2. 7 million for services that year. One Chesapeake document reviewed by Reuters showed McClendon reimbursed the company for the difference. People familiar with the process said the arrangement could amount to a   loan because McClendon does not need to reimburse the company until the end of the year. Most of the accounting work is performed by the special AKM unit. Consider the job held by Bryan Ott, an accountant who earned $200, 000 at Chesapeake last year. His job title is ”Controller, AKM Business Operations,” but Ott does much more than manage McClendon’s money. When McClendon put a vast Oklahoma ranch up for auction, he had Ott handle the matter. When hail damaged a local home McClendon was buying, Ott coordinated the repair so the sale could be completed. Ott also is the registered website administrator for several McClendon personal projects, including one for a massive Lake Michigan resort that has drawn the ire of many townsfolk, and another for a McClendon holding company, Arcadia Resources. Arcadia Resources also acts as a Chesapeake contractor. An Arcadia consultant, Scott Mueller, supervises Ott and at least five other Chesapeake employees working   for AKM Operations. Mueller reports directly to McClendon. Until last year, Chesapeake employee John Garrison was the   person working with AKM Operations. He earned $800, 000 in salary and bonuses, plus another $1 million in equity compensation. Garrison played a variety of roles. He served as treasurer of the McClendon Family Foundation, a 501c3 charity. He also helped McClendon run the $200 million hedge fund from Chesapeake offices, a fund whose existence was disclosed by Reuters on May 2. Garrison retired late last year and is now a contractor for the AKM unit. His current compensation could not be learned. The AKM unit is supplemented by scores of Chesapeake engineers who, among other duties, help calculate McClendon’s reserve holdings in a special incentive program that gives him a chance to invest in every well the company drills. In 2010 at least 60 engineers spent on average six days each on   projects, the records show. Some engineers spent mere hours; one logged more than 100   days. ”Even if it’s true that the executives are reimbursing for using company employees, having this kind of relationship with the company is treating it as a personal fiefdom,” said Hodgson of GMI Ratings. WINE AND BURGERS Separating McClendon’s business interests in Oklahoma City from Chesapeake’s isn’t easy. For example, McClendon holds an interest in a local restaurant, Metro Wine Bar & Bistro, which occupies space owned by a Chesapeake subsidiary. Across the street from the corporate campus, McClendon   Irma’s Burger Shack, often filled with Chesapeake employees during the lunch hour. According to a proxy, another restaurant McClendon   Deep Fork, catered Chesapeake events in 2007 and 2008 at a cost of $390, 000. As a   of the Thunder basketball team, McClendon sits in the front row at games. As Chesapeake CEO he presides over a company that signed a $36 million,   sponsorship deal with the team. This year the company pledged to buy $3 million worth of tickets, and many were distributed to employees and Chesapeake business associates. Although McClendon’s net worth is pegged by Forbes at $1. 1 billion, he has mortgaged much of what he owns: the restaurants, the wine, the boats, the homes, proceeds from three accounts at Goldman Sachs, his stake in private companies and his stake in thousands of Chesapeake wells. The well financing from one backer alone, EIG Global Energy Partners, totals $1. 3 billion, according to a person familiar with the deals. McClendon has even mortgaged part of his stake in his beloved Thunder. He holds 19 percent of a team valued at $350 million. But twice, McClendon has pledged his share of future proceeds from the Thunder as collateral for loans, from Bank of America in 2009 and Wells Fargo in 2010, according to records reviewed by Reuters. Neither loan has been previously disclosed. Further particulars of the Thunder loans    the amount McClendon borrowed, whether they have been repaid or whether the NBA or his Thunder partners were notified    could not be determined. Neither of the banks, nor McClendon and his spokesman, would elaborate on the Thunder loans. THE MCCLENDON GARGOYLES McClendon is generous with his money. He has donated roughly $15 million to Duke University, his and his wife’s alma mater, and $12. 5 million to the University of Oklahoma, his parents’ alma mater. At Oklahoma, the McClendon Center for Intercollegiate Athletics is adjacent to the football stadium, and the McClendon Honors College is named after McClendon’s parents. At Duke, attended by all three McClendon children, a prominent dorm and visitors’ center carry the family name. The chapel organ is named in honor of Katie McClendon. So prolific were McClendon donations to Duke that the university once honored the couple by commissioning gargoyles in their likenesses, hanging them above an arch on the dorm, McClendon Tower. According to the artist, Katie McClendon found them too ostentatious; they were later removed. Beginning about six or seven years ago, McClendon, through Chesapeake, helped lead a concerted effort to remake Oklahoma City. The company started buying land around its campus, including half of the neighborhood across the street. Chesapeake kept mum about its plans. Many outsiders expected more office buildings; they were wrong. In late 2008, McClendon strolled into Balliets, the closest thing in Oklahoma City to Neiman Marcus. He approached the   Bob Benham. ”Aubrey came in with a picture of a dress that he had torn out of The New York Times magazine,” Benham recalled, ”and he wanted to see if he could get it for his wife.” Benham promised to try. ”Then Aubrey spent the next 40 minutes asking me about my background and strategies for the store,” the owner remembered. ”It struck me as odd, because here’s a guy running a huge energy company. Why would he be interested?” Benham found the dress in Japan    a Salvatore Ferragamo    and had it shipped to Katie McClendon within 48 hours. McClendon, it turns out, had been testing him, Benham said. A few months later, a Chesapeake executive approached Benham and said, ”Aubrey wants you to anchor Classen Curve,” a shopping center that McClendon envisioned, located steps from the Chesapeake campus. A chic and sleek shopping venue, Classen Curve is owned by Chesapeake. It now includes stores with names such as On a Whim, Green Goodies and Uptown Kids. The gastro sports pub Republic serves   sliders. Matthew Kenney OKC offers gourmet raw vegan meals. Even the dumpsters are classy, camouflaged by   brick and steel. ”Aubrey saw it as a quality of life issue,” Benham said. ”These things seem peripheral to Chesapeake but really aren’t. You have to have the amenities to attract people.” McClendon calls the amenities ”the jewels”    and on campus they include a    fitness center,   swimming pool and health center that offers teeth whitening and Botox injections. The Classen Curve project is not disclosed in any shareholder filings. Business does not appear brisk; parking lots were largely empty on recent weekdays and many of the shops were vacant. Benham said Chesapeake is choosy. ”They could fill the place up tomorrow,” he said, ”but they want a certain type of tenant.” LAND, LAND, LAND Chesapeake’s expansion in Oklahoma City stretches far beyond Classen Curve. Since 2004 the company has purchased at least 108 local properties for at least $240 million, according to a Reuters analysis of Oklahoma land records. More than half were purchased at prices well above the assessed market value. The 108 tracts and buildings were valued by the Oklahoma County Assessor’s Office at a total market value of $146 million at the time of the purchases. In Oklahoma City, ”market value” is based on recent sales data, said Larry Stein, the county’s chief deputy assessor. Chesapeake paid $38 million for an office building valued at $27 million and $10 million for a church valued at $1. 4 million. In 2006 it paid $16 million for Nichols Hills Plaza, a    shopping center that was valued at $6. 3 million. The company plans a major renovation, said Nichols Hills Mayor Sody Clements. ”We don’t have the money to do it and he does,” the mayor said, interchanging, as many locals do, McClendon for Chesapeake. ”He raises the bar on everything.” From fashion shops to food, McClendon’s vision is reshaping the area near Chesapeake and Nichols Hills. When he became frustrated that Oklahoma City lacked a Whole Foods Market, he persuaded the popular organic chain to bring one to his hometown    and then leased it space on land owned by Chesapeake, across the street from his office. At Nichols Hills Plaza, the energy company is planning to go into the grocery business itself, internal records show. Chesapeake plans to reopen the shuttered Nichols Hills Market and recently put two grocery store managers on its payroll. Their combined salaries exceed $200, 000. ”I think in another life he would have been a city planner or architect,” said the former employee, who worked closely with McClendon for years. ”It’s like playing with Legos for him, envisioning something in his mind, seeing it laid out. He wants to reshape things.” MANY HOMES Even at rest, McClendon remains competitive. His wine collection, stored in cellars across three states and the Caribbean, exceeded 2, 000 bottles, according to a 2009 inventory. It included a   bottle of 1945 Mouton Rothschild, valued at about $100, 000. ”This is not a particularly   cellar,” said Benjamin Wallace, the   author of ”The Billionaire’s Vinegar,” who reviewed McClendon’s wine roster. ”It’s pretty much exclusively   trophy vintages. Just   it, it’s got to be worth millions.” McClendon also owns a $12 million collection of antique maps that fill the walls of Chesapeake buildings. ”His collection of Oklahoma maps and nearby states would be the envy of the Library of Congress,” said Graham Arader, the broker who helped him acquire it. McClendon once angered some shareholders by selling the maps to Chesapeake to meet a margin call; he subsequently agreed to buy them back. In 2005, McClendon set his sights on Bermuda’s   billionaire’s row, a neighborhood that included the vacation homes of Michael Bloomberg, Ross Perot and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. First, he bought an $8. 6 million home and spent $12 million to renovate it. Next he bought the grandest property there for $20. 8 million: an   tract once owned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick’s descendants. McClendon gave the Frick site a makeover and sold it for a small profit. Last year his wife bought an $11 million house there, perched over a spectacular cliff. In his Oklahoma neighborhood, McClendon and his wife live in a $4 million,    stone mansion in Nichols Hills, the tony enclave surrounded by Oklahoma City just a   commute from the Chesapeake campus. He also owns the house next door, purchased for $2. 3 million, and the one behind that, which cost $700, 000, records show. For a time, McClendon also owned yet another neighboring house. ’COMMIT TO THE LORD’ McClendon, an Episcopalian, sometimes invokes religious themes at work. Each day he helps select a quotation that is emailed to employees. Some are from the Bible. A May 2 email quotes Proverbs 16:3: ”Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and your plans will succeed.” Chesapeake also has three ”corporate chaplains” on staff. According to a 2011 job posting, the chaplains provide confidential career, marriage, parenting and   counseling as well as ”spiritual consultation.” The chaplain positions are among Chesapeake jobs that reflect McClendon’s passions. A keen student of history, he has a company historian on staff. A proponent of good health for his employees, he also hired the 2006 winner of the World’s Strongest Man contest, Phil Pfister, in part to promote exercise. On his website, Pfister says he’s a man to whom ”flipping cars, pulling two   or ‘toting tonnage’ comes naturally.” The historian and the World’s Strongest Man, who each earn more than $100, 000, have other duties at Chesapeake. The strongman, for example, promotes Chesapeake’s development efforts in important drilling regions. ROWING ALONG McClendon has poured Chesapeake resources into another love: rowing. In a remarkable feat, Oklahoma City transformed its dry and   riverbed    ”nothing more than a big ditch,” says Mayor Mick Cornett    into an   rowing venue. Chesapeake built two of the venue’s signature attractions, the sleek $3 million Chesapeake Boathouse and   $7 million Chesapeake Finish Line Tower. McClendon also put 10 Olympic hopefuls on the Chesapeake payroll. They earn modest salaries    $30, 000 to $40, 000, plus benefits    and are assigned to departments such as finance and community relations. Even so, according to Chesapeake documents, each of the 10 is officially classified the same way: ”Rower.” Some of the rowers McClendon hired have also flown with him aboard a   jet. On December 12, 2010    a Sunday    the CEO took five rowers on a   trip to San Diego, the flight logs show. McClendon brought a son along, too. Total   cost to shareholders: $34, 000.

"
" Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison is the frontrunner to lead the Democratic National Committee in the Trump era. Ellison has a fascinating backstory: He’s the first Muslim elected to the US Congress, and he was the second member of Congress to endorse Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign.     Now Sanders has returned the favor, backing Ellison to lead the DNC. But in an unexpected effort to close ranks, Sen. Chuck Schumer  —   who does not exactly come from Sanders’s wing of the Democratic Party  —   has also backed Ellison.  Which isn’t to say Ellison doesn’t face a race. Many in the White House are known to be skeptical of Ellison for this job, and have recruited Tom Perez, the popular outgoing labor secretary, to challenge Ellison.  The campaign between the two men is increasingly seen as a new front in the fight between the Sanders and Clinton wings of the party  —   but that’s a bit absurd. The position they’re running for is more operational than ideological.     I recently had Ellison on my podcast, and I wanted to draw him out on the specifics of his vision for the job. What powers does the DNC chair have? How does Ellison want to use them? What is his philosophy of party organizing? How does a party  —   as opposed to a candidate  —   build a relationship with voters? What should the national party apparatus be doing in off years? How much confrontation should there be with Donald Trump?     We get into the weeds of party building here, and it’s obviously a topic Ellison has thought about a lot  —   both in his own campaigns and in his run for DNC chair. The Democratic Party has some hard choices to make in the coming years, and so it’s well worth hearing where Ellison wants to push it. You can listen to our podcast conversation here, or subscribe on iTunes. A transcript of our discussion, edited for length and clarity, follows.  Why have Democrats lost so much   strength during Obama’s presidency? Ezra Klein We’re talking a night after President Obama gave his farewell address. Last I looked at Obama’s polling, which was a day or two ago, he’s at 56 percent [popularity]. He’s leaving office a very popular president.     Keith Ellison He sure is. Ezra Klein  He’s more popular than Ronald Reagan was when he left office. At the same time, over the past eight years, Democrats’ share of seats in the US Senate has fallen from 59 to 48. They’ve lost 62 House seats, 12 governorships, and, this is the number that I keep getting caught up on, 958 seats in state legislatures. Why do you think that is? Keith Ellison  I think the reason that we’ve had those losses is because the DNC is viewed more as a presidential campaign apparatus rather than a program or an agency designed to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot all the time. The DNC really should be the instrument for the    Democrat all over the country  —   in Idaho, in Chicago, in Minneapolis, in Florida. But we treat it like it’s not the Democratic National Committee; we treat it like it’s the Democratic Presidential National Committee. Because of that, we have not really had the outreach and the door knocking and the engagement   that we need to have. That’s too bad.  The thing is that before 2008, we had the   strategy, and that is in fact still pretty popular among DNC members. As you notice, we did pretty well in 2006; we did pretty well in 2008. I think that’s because we still had enough connectivity in place from that   strategy, but as time wore on, the tremendous popularity of Barack Obama, his amazing rhetorical skills, his just unparalleled ability to explain things and to inspire people really is the fuel that we lived on. Because of that, we lost a lot.     At the same time, Republicans made some strategic decisions. . .. There are articles before 2010 where Karl Rove is saying, ”We’ve got this new thing called Maptitude, or this new software that’s helping us identify places of opportunity. We’re going to be going into the small towns. We’re going to Erie, Pennsylvania. We’re going to Peoria, Illinois. We’re going to get competitive at the very local level.”  Also there was massive investment by the Koch brothers. As we were focusing on our champion, President Obama, the other side was actually thinking creatively about how they can really dominate on the state level and on the local level. Those two things together gave us some unprecedented losses. I’m going to tell you though, Ezra, we can come back. We absolutely can. We just have to refocus our game plan, but if we do, 2018 and 2020 can be years of great promise.  Ezra Klein  I’d like to hear about that. I’d like to be very specific and operational, mechanical, because I think that’s something that gets lost when we talk about the DNC chair race. You’re running for DNC chair.  Keith Ellison Yes, I am.  Ezra Klein  It is being understood and covered as an ideological contest. I think that’s fair to say.  Keith Ellison That’s too bad, though.  Ezra Klein  It’s an operational position more than an ideological position. That’s what I wanted to talk about. What are the levers you have as DNC chair to pull? What are the mechanisms you think would work here? What literal policies would you change from how the DNC works now that would make it less the Democratic Presidential Committee and more the Democratic National Committee? Keith Ellison  Well, first thing is, if I win, right away we’re going to start with an attitudinal change around turnout. Voter turnout has got to be something that is on the mind of every    Democrat, every Democratic officeholder. We must, in terms of turnout, think in terms of expanding the electorate beyond the people who are the likely voters in the swing states. Turnout has got to be key.     When I was elected in 2006, my district had the lowest turnout in the state of Minnesota. Now it’s the highest, and it’s consistently the highest. One of the reasons why is because we focus on turnout 365 days of year.  Ezra Klein  When you say you focus on it, what do you specifically do? Keith Ellison  We have an apartment program. We found out that you if knock on a door one day and you come back in a year, there’s a   chance that person doesn’t even live there anymore. If you don’t go there except for election time, there’s an even greater chance  —   a 50 percent chance of a 50 percent chance after two years.  There are hundreds of apartment buildings in the Fifth Congressional District. I’ve got staff that identified all of them that have more than around five or six units. Then we make contact with the managers of all of them. We got captains in them. Then in the off year, we knock them. We have meetings there. Then when some people don’t want to be bothered, that’s why they live in an apartment, the management will be able to tell them, ”The politicians are going to be knocking today, so if you don’t want them to knock, put up a sign on your door.”  The other thing we do in every year off year is a massive summer knock. We knock all year round, but we have a special, massive summer knock, where we get a whole bunch of college students and pair them with our paid staff. Last summer, in 2015, we had 9, 000 conversations. It took us about 30, 000 tries to get those 9, 000 conversations, but we collected data. We cleaned up our list. We got back in touch with people. We sent them an important signal, which is that we don’t just care about you when we want your vote. We care about you and want to have an ongoing, durable relationship with you. That kind of thing people remember.  Then, of course, we would do a lot of things in between, regular pizza parties, coffee klatches. I have the biggest Labor Day picnic in Minnesota. We have a     concert with our rap community right before the election.     The real idea is not the big events. The real idea is the canvassing, the door knocking, the calling. Then the other thing we do is we continually ask people to help us. We’re asking people, ”There’s a vote coming up. What do you think? There’s a vote coming up. What’s your opinion? Sign up on this petition. Sign up on that petition.” People are constantly feeling like they’re partnering with me as the member of Congress from their district.  That’s why not only do I win with a high percentage  —   my predecessor won with a high percentage  —   but I don’t even care about the percentage. I care about the raw numbers that we are turning out. When I first got into office, I had 150, 000 votes. Now if we don’t get 250, 000 votes, we feel disappointed. Because we got 250, 000 this year and we got 262, 000 in 2012.  There are no statewide Republicans in Minnesota. Not any, not one. Amy Klobuchar, Al Franken, Democrats. Mark Dayton, our governor, Democrat; Attorney General Lori Swanson, Democrat. We don’t have no statewide Republicans. We used to. You remember Tim Pawlenty, who used to be the governor, and you remember Norm Coleman. Why can’t a Norm Coleman or a Tim Pawlenty get back into statewide office? Because in the Fifth Congressional District, we spike the vote so high they cannot get in.  I’ll give you another example of what I’m talking about here. Steve Simon’s the secretary of state for the state of Minnesota. When he ran in 2014, he was the only incumbent. The Republicans put a lot of energy into that, because they figured if they can beat him, that would be their chance to win a statewide office. They actually did beat Steve in five of eight congressional districts, but we beat them so bad in the Fifth Congressional District that we still won. That’s the kind of thing that we do. In 2014, voter turnout statewide decreased in the state of Minnesota from 2010, hitting a   low. In my district, we increased turnout by 3 percent in 2014. Even in down years, we’re going up. It’s the only congressional district in Minnesota, the fifth district, where voter turnout grew between 2010 and 2014. That’s what we’re doing, and that’s why I think I need to be the DNC chair.  Ezra Klein  Those are very impressive numbers, and particularly the point about 2014 turnout increasing in your district. That’s an achievement. But you keep saying the word ”we.” I recognize that you mean your campaign staff, all your volunteers, the college kids. But in your congressional district, what is being organized around is you. In American politics in general, one reason presidential years have so much higher turnout than midterm years, to say nothing of   periods, is that people find it easier to connect with the presidential candidate.     Neither political party in the country is actually a popular institution. People don’t like Republicans. They don’t like Democrats. Right now we have the highest share of independents as a share of the electorate that we’ve basically ever had. How do you create that connection, then, on behalf of an institution? How do you give people something they connect to when it’s not Keith Ellison, this nice guy who maybe knocked on your door a couple of years back, but it’s the Democratic Party?  Keith Ellison We give them the personalities. For example, we’re going to be doing regular live streaming straight to Democratic    members, which is something we’re not doing now. Who are we going to give them? We’re going to give them Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker and all these engaging personalities. We’re going to give them Cedric Richmond. We’re going to give them Barbara Lee. We’re going to give them those people that they watch on the TV shows and love and want to hear about. We’re going to give them the union president in Indiana who stood up to Donald Trump.  Here we live in the age of Trump. This guy, the most misogynistic candidate, beats the first woman candidate. This is devastating to women in this country, and men too, but we’re going to feature women in these live casts and talk about equal pay, access to reproductive care. Talk about how the economic fortunes of a family are directly connected to reproductive access and the Hyde Amendment.  We have to face the facts that the Republicans have   us. They simply have. I know it’s true because I got a good friend of mine who was a Republican, now a Democrat. She’s a city council member in Northfield, Minnesota. She will say, ”Man, when I was Republican and I was a city council member, they connected me. I was part of this. I was part of that. I was on calls. I got data. I got talking points. Now that I’m a Democrat city council member, I feel better about my soul because this is what I believe in, but you guys don’t stay that closely in touch with us.”  My thought is that’s the challenge. We’ve got to match them organizationally, and then we put some of these dynamic personalities in front of people. People will begin to think, when they think Democrat, they’re thinking Franklin Roosevelt. They’re thinking Hubert H. Humphrey. They’re thinking Barack Obama, who has 57 percent approval rating. That’s the thing. I don’t think we feature our people well enough.  Ezra Klein You mentioned talking points, organizing, and getting more people on shows. That’s the communications side of it. But something that has happened on the Republican side in states and in cities has been the creation of a much more aggressive, substantive agenda for state legislators, for local city council members. People hear about groups like ALEC [the American Legislative Exchange Council] but there’s a lot of it. The playbook of what to do if you suddenly have power in a state and you’re a Republican is much more aggressive and fully formed.     You have states where Democrats have a lot of power, California being an example, but you don’t see an aggressive, reproducible agenda emergent there. Is that something you think is a strength or weakness of Democrats? Is it good that Democrats are not sitting around moving legislation from one state to another? Or do Democrats in the states need to make it much clearer what they are going to do if you elect them? Keith Ellison I have no doubt that it’s a weakness. What is the root of that weakness? We’re highly siloed. We are highly siloed. One of the things we have got to do is to create a truly national coordinated campaign committee. Now, I’m not saying that US House people are going to tell the US Senate what to do or that Democratic municipal officeholders are going to tell the state legislators what to do, but we have got to have some sort of working coordination.  For example, just look at voting rights. The Republicans are so coordinated that the day after Shelby County gets struck by the Supreme Court, which is also part of their coordination, their legislative arm, because it’s clearly one body, shoots out proposed legislation on everything from getting rid of early voting to pushing a photo ID to saying that    can’t register even if they’re going to be 18 by the election. They’ve done this all over the country and in an amazingly coordinated fashion.  I do not believe that Democrats have identified the fact that voter expansion has to be a strategic goal of ours, and yet Republicans clearly are aware that voter suppression must be a strategic goal of theirs. They’re actively suppressing the vote. They’re doing it in 50 states. They’re doing it with a PR program. They’re doing it with a state legislative program. They’re doing it with a city program, just simply not enough voting machines. They’re doing it with a legal program. What are we doing? We’re doing state by state. Oregon’s doing great work, but what about others? This should be 50 pieces of legislation introduced in all states that expand the vote. That’s clearly what we need to be doing. The DNC has to help do that.  What if we just got every   state seat Democrat, and we got every senator that is up, we got them all in a room together and said, ”You guys talk and figure out how that state seat Democrat, just by increasing turnout in their own district, can help you win statewide.” Those conversations haven’t been happening. Who’s going to help coordinate that conversation? I think the DNC should be part of that.  Are Democrats too focused on “identity politics”? Ezra Klein If you take over the Democratic National Committee, you’re going to be in leadership of a party that is trying to work its way through some pretty deep fissures right now. One is the Bernie   Clinton fissure from the primary, which has not healed. But beneath that cleavage is an argument that you’ve begun hearing play out in more and more explicit terms about whether Democrats in the modern era focus too much on what some people call ”identity politics.” Some people feel that Democrats have become too focused on calling out acts of racism, have become too focused on giving one thing to each of the different groups that are in the Democratic coalition as opposed to having a more singular message around economic policy. I’m curious how you navigate that debate.     Keith Ellison I think the DNC needs to point out repeatedly that if we don’t have social inclusion, we won’t have economic inclusion either. Ronald Reagan, right before his election in 1980, goes to Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Schwerner, Chaney, Goodman were murdered and buried in the earthen dam, and gives a speech on states’ rights. Now, everybody in America who’s cracked their history book knows exactly what he’s doing. He’s   racism. He’s telling white, Southern men that he’s on their side against their black neighbors. That’s what he’s doing. Well, as soon as Reagan gets in, one of the first things he does is fires the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, and that helps begin the flattening of the American wage for working people.  There are many examples where politicians sow division between people, and then when they get in power they suppress the wages of all people who labor every day to make a living. That is a recurring thing. We have got to help people understand that, for example, when we were maybe at our best, the March on Washington was the march for jobs and civil rights, and Walter Reuther and Martin Luther King were together. When we’re at our best, we are that rainbow coalition. We recognize that whether you are gay or transgender, you’ve got to earn a living, whether you’re a white male in Tennessee, you’ve got to earn a living. That’s the reality for all of us.  Ezra Klein  Let me push you on this a little bit. People hear that answer and then what they think is, ”But it feels   to me. It feels that immigrants coming over the border are taking my jobs.” And it’s not always racial. One of my colleagues, Sarah Kliff, she went up to Kentucky. She was talking to people who voted for Donald Trump but were on Obamacare. One of the things they said was, ”I’m pissed off about the folks who are poorer than me, who don’t work, and who get Medicaid. They don’t have these high deductibles that I have. They don’t all this cost sharing that I have.”  One of the things that Donald Trump spoke to with great effectiveness is the feeling people have that the pie is only so big, which there are times when it is. For instance, with government programs oftentimes. That what maybe could go to them or could go to their community or could go to their family is instead going to someone else. What Trump did for a lot of white Americans is he came and said, ”I’m going to make sure it goes to you. I’m going to make sure these people aren’t coming over and taking it from you.” When you say you need social inclusion, I think what a lot of people hear is, “We’re going to bring in all these folks, and those slices of the pie are going to get a lot smaller. ” Keith Ellison  See, that’s why we’ve got to be in people’s doorways and at people’s VFW halls and we got to be talking to them. Because I would say, you show me a Southern, a white person in Kentucky who voted for Trump and is now worrying about their Obamacare taken away, I’ll show you a person who Democrats haven’t even knocked on their door in years. I’ll show you some people who haven’t been talked to. They haven’t heard the other side of the story. Because I’m going to tell you right now, if they framed resource allocation as a basic issue of scarcity, we going to lose that one. There’s not enough. Obviously you’re going to pick you and your family over somebody you don’t know and have heard a lot of bad things about.  Here’s the reality of it. There is enough in America, man. There is enough. Now, there’s not enough if we give the richest people the lowest tax rates, like the hedge fund managers. There’s not enough if we let some people hoard massive amounts of wealth overseas because of the deferral provision in our tax code. There’s not enough then. If you can get a tax break for your plane and your jet and all that, there may not be enough then. If we had even a tax code like the one we had in 1975, we could make sure that the rich get to keep their money, but everybody else can make it too. Once they got you in the scarcity frame, they got you over a barrel. It’s easy then to work racial, ethnic, gender, age division.     What if we did have a tiny sales tax on stock trades, derivatives, and bonds like we used to before the   like so many other countries around the world do? What if we put it all into higher ed? That’s my point. What if we just ended deferral, make them folks pay taxes on that money? See, those conversations got to be had, because those folks in Kentucky are smart, but they can’t know what they’ve never been exposed to. They can’t be exposed to the idea if we’ve never brought it to them. That’s my argument. We’ve got to go to the people. We’ve got to talk to the people. You can’t expect an overnight flip, but you will get the change you’re looking for if you stick and you stay and you gain people’s trust.  That’s why we got to have a Democratic Party that is 50 states, that is 365 days a year, that is focused on building out at the county level and the state level, and that moves resources from DC to the locations closest to the actual voter. Then we’ve got to reorient our thinking around turnout as opposed to just getting a higher percentage in the election than our opponent. We do have to do some soul searching, but it is what’s in our grasp to do.  How should Democrats define themselves? Ezra Klein Hillary Clinton had, I may get the exact number wrong here, but it was something like 44 policies. As somebody who read a bunch of those policies, I can tell you that those policies had   and the   had  . A lot of the things that you’re talking about here, they’re even in there. On the other hand, Donald Trump had seven, at least for a long period of time. Two of them were repeated  —   he had an immigration policy and then a    policy. I saw that and thought, “This is absurd. ” You rethink it, and you say the logic. Where a lot of people, I think, didn’t quite know what Hillary Clinton stood for, people knew Donald Trump wanted to build the wall, wanted to cut taxes, wanted to screw with China. That’s what he was going to do. I guess I’d ask you, when you think about defining the Democratic Party to people, when you think about being in that doorway and you’ve only got a couple seconds really, a couple of minutes at most, what three ideas do you want to define the Democratic Party? Keith Ellison  The Democratic Party is for economic inclusion. Your family ought to make a living too. The Democratic Party is for everybody being respected, liberty and justice for all. I just got two. Ezra Klein  Those are values. Give me the policies. What are you saying will be done?    Keith Ellison  We’re going to raise your wages. We’re going to have a fair trade model. We’re going to make it so you cannot be discriminated against based on who you are. We’re going to get rid of mass incarceration. We’re going to invest in our infrastructure as a country, really, not how Trump says. Those things are simple. Guess what? There was a candidate who talked in simple language and got a lot of support in the last election.  Ezra Klein  Are you talking here about Bernie Sanders? Keith Ellison  Yeah.  Ezra Klein  Tell me a bit about how you read the aftermath of the Sanders campaign and how you think about the fight within the party around Bernie Sanders and what he represented and what he didn’t represent. He did, as you say, get a lot of support, but he didn’t win the primary. There’s a real feeling on behalf of his backers that he clearly would’ve won the general election. How do you think about that? Keith Ellison  I’m one of those who says I don’t know. I think Hillary Clinton was a great candidate. I’m very proud of her candidacy. I will say this: Speaking in a few clear points and then repeating those points is good campaigning. There’s no doubt about that. There’s a lot of reasons why Hillary Clinton didn’t win. In fact, she got more votes than the other side, but if you want to talk about in the Midwest, with Michigan, Wisconsin, and so forth, I think she was put in a very difficult position because of the president’s advocacy of the   Partnership. It was just hard for her to get people to believe her on trade, even though I believed her. I was honored to support her because I believed her.  To just say Bernie would’ve won  —   I don’t know if Bernie would’ve won, but I can tell you this. There’s no doubt that clear messaging is critical to electoral success. That’s why when people ask me what does the Democratic Party stand for, well, it stands for inclusion, economically, making sure your family can make a good living, and it’s for respect for all. Those are two simple ideas to me.  Ezra Klein  One thing that I’ve thought a bit about is that people limit this argument to Sanders and Clinton. But down ballot, you can see a lot of different lessons in there. You have Jason Kander in Missouri who ran 15 points, I think it was, ahead of Hillary Clinton but was a more conservative candidate. You have Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, who is a real tribune of progressive politics but didn’t do better than Clinton. Are there lessons in the election that actually the Democratic Party, if it wants to be more competitive in Michigan and more competitive in Pennsylvania, needs to worry about moving too far to the left? Keith Ellison  See, I don’t think it’s a left or right thing. I really don’t. I think that if we engage a real, substantive relationship with the voters, a lot of these ideological questions get sorted out on their own. I believe that in Arizona they passed an increase in the minimum wage and got rid of [Sheriff Joe] Arpaio. I think in Arizona, Trump still won. The cities in Texas went blue. Harris County went blue. Dallas County went blue. San Antonio went blue. Austin went blue. They are knocking on the door. In Georgia, they did pretty well. In North Carolina, we won the governorship, should’ve won the senatorship.     I would say that where we won, we won because people really knocked on the door, 365 days a year, and were unrelenting talking about what the Democratic Party was about. Then the other thing they did is allow people the space to say, ”We’re the Georgia Democratic Party. We’re the Tennessee Democratic Party. We’re the Arizona Democratic Party.” They allowed for local differentiation, which I think is just fine. We don’t need to have a cookie cutout. We don’t care if they localize the flavor as long as the core ideas are still there.   I think that if you get beneath the surface, there are some important lessons to be learned. That lesson in my opinion is we got to reemphasize field. We don’t need to get rid of television, but we need to reconceive of how we do it. We need to campaign 365 days a year. We’ve got to integrate all of our assets so that we’re not so highly siloed. That’s what I think the lessons are.  Can there be decency in politics in the age of Trump? Ezra Klein  I’ve been thinking a lot about a tweet Donald Trump sent on new year’s morning. He said, “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. Love!”  Before Trump was elected, before this whole election, when it was President Obama and it was Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we already at that moment would’ve said, ”America is bitterly, deeply divided.”  We’re divided by politics. We are talking a lot more recently about our divisions around race. This is already a powder keg of a time. Now you have a president coming in who is modeling a politics of petty viciousness in a way that I haven’t actually seen, who as a strategy, wants to keep his opponents in a continuous state of distracted outrage. And it’s all happening on these social networks that really incentivize nasty behavior from us. Everyone I know is on Twitter. I think we are all worse people on Twitter than we are in real life.  I recognize how much this makes me sound like an old man before my time, but I worry the incentives to really make politics a cruel and   and angry and vengeful place are getting stronger, and that behavior is going to be modeled in a way that’s going to make it feel very okay. To use a word people like using now, it’s going to be normalized from the top. I’m wondering if you think about this, and if so, how you think about navigating through it.     Keith Ellison  Oh yeah. Let me tell you. I am worried about this because I know that there have been many times in American history when politics was particularly vitriolic. 1850s come to mind. See my point? Ezra Klein I do see your point. That doesn’t make me feel better. Things went pretty bad.  Keith Ellison  Right. We have been in points of American history when Americans have been at each other pretty bad. It’s been actually worse than now. I think the real thing is that leaders who keep the core principles of the nation in mind are particularly necessary in moments like this. I don’t know if Henry Clay helped history or just delayed history, but he kept the states from having a war. He did it on the backs of some people, African Americans, but there’s been a number of times in American history when we’ve had bitter conflict. In the 1930s, thank goodness, we had leaders like Roosevelt and, even more important than him, people like Frances Perkins. Franklin Roosevelt was bitterly attacked, by the way. It was nasty.  I guess what I have to say is that the DNC has to appeal to people’s better nature, has to talk to people around things that are actually going to improve their lives. The DNC has to understand that emotion drives choice and that if all we do is spit a bunch of facts at people, that they may not get it because emotion really does drive choices. Fear makes people reflect less, and it also makes them concede to authoritarian leadership more. The thing is, I’m running for DNC chair because I think this is a moment where real patriots have to consider the best interests of their nation. I think trying to heal our country is a duty of love, honestly. Ezra Klein  What do you think you shouldn’t do as DNC chair, then? What are going to be the hard decisions that need to be made in this era to heal? Keith Ellison  How we heal all turns back to figuring out what’s ailing us, right? I think the real cause of the pain that America is in is 40 years of the economy tilting dramatically against working people. The reason I think that’s the problem is because I think what ends up happening is that then people at the top of the economy, like Donald Trump, who want to maintain privilege and hierarchy then appeal to Americans based on division in order to maintain power.     I think in some ways, it is the inequality that helps fuel the negativity. To me, rebuilding the Democratic Party to get us back in the game, to get us winning some elections where we can really stand up for some policies that are more equitable, where we can really experience shared prosperity, will actually lessen some of the hyperbole and the toxic rhetoric.  That’s not a   project, though. I don’t know if there’s a magic wand to wave to get us from where we’re at, because we’ve got a president who openly demonstrates contempt for the press, a First Amendment —  protected institution. Openly says he’s going to ban people based on their religion. He is openly proposing things that strike at our Constitution. I can’t tell you we’re going to be fine. People of integrity, your country needs you. That’s for both sides of the aisle.  The most important thing I think I can do at the DNC is not contribute to the toxicity, but at the same time not back down from a fight. I’m not going to   like him. I’m not going to   his supporters either, except for certain of them like the openly racist ones, like David Duke and people like that. The main body of their supporters don’t subscribe to those beliefs. In fact, we’re trying to help the main body of his supporters. Ezra Klein  How do you think about understanding the folks on the other side from you? Who do you make a point of reading regularly whose ideas you don’t agree with? Keith Ellison I read Dick Armey’s book Give Us Liberty. I thought that was an interesting book because he describes the rise of the Tea Party. I try and read a mixture of people I agree with and people I don’t necessarily agree with. I’m reading Terry McAuliffe’s book What a Party. He used to be the DNC chair, so I’m reading his biography. I think that’s interesting. There’s a book called Strangers in Their Own Land that I just got through reading. It’s about white working class. I read J. D. Vance’s book Hillbilly Elegy, just got through that. Thought that was a great book.  Ezra Klein What did you take away from Hillbilly Elegy? Keith Ellison That there are a whole lot of people who are differentiated primarily by race but who share the same economic circumstances all over the country. That there’s a general misunderstanding as to why that is and what to do about it. I know J. D. Vance is probably a conservative, but the book he wrote, he makes me wonder why, because Social Security helped keep his family together. If we had a more robust housing policy that could’ve helped his mom, if we had more mental health resources and chemical help, that could’ve helped his family. He does add in personal responsibility as an issue, but even then, I think that government could help people maintain personal responsibility and help people. This was my take on it.  Ezra Klein  In his book, though, he expresses deep frustration with the decisions people made. He talked about working at a good, straightforward job with decent pay and watching   simply not show up. So to this question of why is he a conservative, I think that part of his view is that you shouldn’t be able to do that, that you shouldn’t be rewarded for that, that there shouldn’t be something that catches you too much if you just refuse to take the job. What did you think of that argument? Keith Ellison  I thought he was using an individual to try to make an argument for a society. Honestly, I think most people do go to work. I think most people do work hard. Of course, you’ve got people who are irresponsible and don’t take the opportunities that are given to them. Is that most people? Absolutely not.  For example, in Florida, I think the governor said he was going to   everybody on welfare. His wife apparently owned the company that offered the testing kits for these drug tests. Then after thousands and thousands and thousands of people were tested, they came up with three people who tested positive. Three. Not even a full handful of fingers. You’ll spend more money looking for welfare fraud than you will find in money of welfare fraud.  There’s myths in our society, and we’re ready to believe them because everybody wants to believe they’re more moral, more right, more good than somebody else. What we have to do is say, ”You know what? People really are good.” Republicans start out with saying, ”People are bad, and when people do bad things, that’s just them being how they are.” Ezra Klein  Do you really think Republicans see it that way? If you ask Paul Ryan, do you think Paul Ryan would say he thinks people are fundamentally bad? Keith Ellison  I don’t know if Paul Ryan would say that or not. I can tell you Paul Ryan is very a mannered person and interpersonally is respectful to people who he encounters, whether they’re Democrats or Republicans. What is his core? He says that he believes the writings of Ayn Rand. What does she believe? She believes that you got to look out for yourself, that charity is for suckers and the highest good is to please yourself. If he really believes what he says he believes, I would say, yeah. If I asked him, he may not put it that way.  It’s expensive to be poor Ezra Klein I found out something I didn’t know about you. You’re a podcaster. Keith Ellison I am a podcaster. I’m on We the Podcast. You can get it on iTunes. We have many episodes, but the focal point of the podcast is how the people outside of the millionaire and billionaire class experience the economy. We’ve done stuff on the diaper need  —   Ezra Klein What is the diaper need?  Keith Ellison The Women, Infants, and Children [nutrition program] and regular welfare programs tend not to cover diapers. A small family that has infant children, who’s facing some tough times and needs some extra help, they can get food, and they may be able to get health care and housing assistance, but diapers, which can be very expensive, are not included in that benefit. As a result, now you have babies in diapers longer than they should be. You have rashes. You have illness. You have kids staying home. You have parents having to take off work.  As a result, there have been folks who have pulled together diaper banks, but they can’t meet the overall need. This is not just folks who stay at home all the time. These are working parents. Some of them are in school. They’re the working poor. They’re making eight bucks an hour. They’re making 10 bucks an hour. On top of that, they got to afford diapers, which are pretty expensive.   people pay less for diapers because they can buy them in greater bulk. Ezra Klein That’s one of the realizations I think you have when you start to study poverty, that it’s very expensive to be poor. The loans you get cost more. The food you buy costs more, at least for the same item. There are a lot of ways if you have time and you have resources and you have market power that you’re just able to get better deals in the economy. If you’re poor and you don’t have a lot of money, you get screwed on that level.  Keith Ellison  So true. We the Podcast explores that. We went into how housing prices in Milwaukee in the worst part of town are not appreciably lower than in other parts of town where housing quality is way better. In one episode, we talked to the author of the book Evicted, to talk about the high cost of rent nowadays, particularly in urban centers but also in rural areas.  We’ve talked about manufactured housing, what some folks call trailers, and talk about this really promising new development where some folks are buying the property that they live on so that they can control it. Most trailer parks, you might own the trailer, but you don’t own the land you live on. That can be pretty expensive and can be pretty low quality, and people can get trapped. We go into all that stuff.  We also go into the voting gap. Leave aside who donates money, leave aside all that.   people vote in higher percentages than   people. That is part of the reason why the electorate is a little more conservative than the population. Ezra Klein  I want to hold there for a minute. I listened to a bunch of these episodes [and] the voting gap is a recurrent theme. You had a podcast about [Joe Soss’s research] showing that folks who are on programs like TANF, which people think of as welfare, don’t vote in higher numbers, which is what people might think.  Instead, what he finds is that if you feel like the object of a government, if you’re acted upon by the government through programs that humiliate you with drug testing and other things, you’re more likely to withdraw from the system. And so part of creating participation, particularly among poorer Americans who rely on government services, is for those interactions with the government to be respectful in a way that they often are not. I’m curious what you took away from that around program design and about what that moment of interaction between the people the government serves and the programs they use feels like.  Keith Ellison  Absolutely. Americans of all economic strata benefit from some kind of a government program, but people have a tendency to associate tax cuts and deductions not with the government helping them, if you understand what I mean.  Ezra Klein Right, so if you get the mortgage interest deduction, that’s money that’s yours. You got it back; it’s not a government program helping you out.  Keith Ellison That’s exactly right. Even if you went to the EITC [earned income tax credit] a lot of people, one, don’t take advantage of it, but even for the folks who do, there’s just this idea that the government’s not helping you. They’re just giving you back your own money. The truth is that based on the tax code, that’s actually the government’s money that we’re allowing you to keep.  People don’t think the government does much for them, although the government does a whole lot for them. The result is that   rhetoric can come out of the same person who is the beneficiary of tremendous government largesse. That’s part of what I think the Democratic Party has to do, is really help people understand how much the government really does help them. I think we could do a whole lot more in terms of public education on that score.  Ellison’s favorite books Ezra Klein  I asked you about books from people you don’t agree with, but what are your three favorite books? Keith Ellison  I think the book that probably impacted me the most is a book I read years and years and years ago. It’s called Manchild in the Promised Land, by, I think, Claude Brown. I don’t know if it’s my favorite book, but it was one of the most impactful on me. The Autobiography of Malcolm X I think is just fundamental, irreplaceable. Everybody should read it. I think it’s one of great American letters. I really love this book The Warmth of Other Suns. I’ve read it many times. It’s about probably one of the world’s great internal migrations. It talks about how people who had a lot of problems in the South being black under segregation did everything they could to improve the quality of their lives by moving North, by moving West, and outlined their struggles. Reading’s one of the great joys of living, so you let me know how many more you want me to talk about.  Ezra Klein As many more as you’d like. Why don’t you give us one more and then I’ll let you go, because I do know you’re pressed on time.  Keith Ellison There’s one book that I would really, really, really recommend that everybody get their hands on, and that’s Matthew Desmond’s book Evicted. This is an important book about housing and the rental crisis we’re in, which makes it particularly disturbing that Donald Trump has nominated Ben Carson to be head of HUD. If ever we needed an awesome HUD secretary, it’s right now. What we got is somebody who doesn’t know the first thing, and that’s really sad.  One of the points that Matthew Desmond makes in the book Evicted, he said, ”Look, rent eats first. Rent eats before diapers. Rent eats before food.” What gets paid first is rent, because people got to have somewhere to live. The rent gets paid first. I think even if you’re conservative or if you’re progressive, no matter who you are, if we really tried to attack poverty by going at housing first, we could do tremendous good in improving the lives of a whole lot of Americans.  Also there’s a book by Frank Luntz. I like reading his stuff. He’s an interesting guy. I can’t figure out which one to pick out now, but he’s a conservative. Borrow his book at the library. I’m not trying to get anybody to buy his book. But particularly if you’re progressive and you want to understand how conservatives think, it’s a good idea to read him.  Ari Berman wrote a book recently, Give Us the Ballot. If you believe we’re a representative democracy and the vote is essential to what it means to be in America, Ari Berman’s book will be good reading. Those are some ones that I’ve read, and that I’ve read either in the beginning of my adult life or some that I’ve read even just more recently. Of course, I read trash too. I read all the books that Dan Brown wrote; I’ve read them all. I like them. They’re fun.  "
" Politically speaking, there was no debate on United States international trade agreements in 2016: All politicians seeking to win a national election, or even to create a   political coalition, agree that our trade agreements are bad things.    From the left, we had Democratic presidential primary   Bernie Sanders  —   and a remarkably close   he was  —   slamming trade. From the  —   I do not think it’s wrong but it’s not quite correct to call it “right,” at least not as Americans have hitherto understood what “right” is  —   but from somewhere, we had   Donald Trump. Listen to them: The rhetoric is the same. It goes like this: The jobs America wants to have  —   the good jobs, the manufacturing jobs  —   have gone. First came NAFTA, in 1993. Then there was China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which granted China a normal country’s freedom to export to other countries, and obligations to accept imports from other countries. Finally, there was the    (and, as of this week, officially dead)   Partnership (TPP).  Such agreements will leave, or have left, ”millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache” (Trump) have ”lost [us]   …     manufacturing jobs” (Trump) and created “catastrophe” (Trump). The agreements amount to ”the death blow for American manufacturing” (Sanders) they “undermine our independence” (Trump) and they ”forced American workers to compete against desperate and   labor around the world” (Sanders) all while causing ”massive job losses in the United States and the shutting down of tens of thousands of factories” (Sanders).    And what did we hear from the center establishment? We had popular vote —  winning (but Electoral College —  losing) Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. She stated: “I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the   Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president.   …    ”    The rhetoric of all three candidates resonates with the criticism of trade agreements that we heard way back when NAFTA was on the table as a proposal  —   not, as today, something to blame all our current economic woes on. The independent Ross Perot and Republican insurgent Pat Buchanan claimed NAFTA would produce ”a giant sucking sound [of jobs] going south” (Perot) that we’ve “wrecked the country with these kinds of deals” (Perot) that the deal added up to “  1, 200 pages of rules, regulations, laws, fines, commissions  —   plus side agreements  —   setting up no fewer than 49 new bureaucracies” (Buchanan). The political truthiness has been flying thick and fast on this subject for decades now. Politicians are taking claims that have a very tenuous connection to economic reality  —   claims that feel true  —   and running with them, sometimes out of ignorance, sometimes because of cynical calculation.    Trump and Sanders were apocalyptic in their discussions of trade, and then Clinton abandoned the truth, too Clinton was clearly the candidate whose policy claims, as a whole, had the best empirical support, so her surrender to truthy proclamations about trade was especially galling. Her advisers and experts, I am certain, did not believe the TPP would kill jobs or hold down wages, although they may have been aware of some of the technocratic economic complaints about the TPP.  Those complaints, with which I sympathize, were twofold. First, that the TPP would have given US owners of intellectual property too much of a whip hand in their extraction of economic rents from people in poorer countries. It would have made them pay through the nose for research and development that had already been done, and had already been paid for out of profits earned in the US. Second, it set in stone rules for judging whether governments were treating companies fairly. We do want a trading system in which companies exporting and investing have confidence that they will not be specifically discriminated against by governments, but the form such rules should take are very delicate. It’s not wise to set them in stone before we see how they work. The general agreement among those who analyzed the TPP, however, was that it was on the whole very profitable for the US: Yes, it made poor foreigners pay through the nose for intellectual property. But it was definitely not a job killer for the US, or a wage suppressor. And insofar as those who profited from the TPP then turned around and employed workers in the US, which to a great extent they would have, it would have been a wage and job booster.    But for the purposes of the HRC campaign, a job killer and a wage suppressor it had to be. And so it became. But the truthiness on the subject of trade agreements was flying even thicker and faster from the others, from Sanders last spring, from Trump  —   and, again, earlier, from Perot and Buchanan.  Yes, America has been losing manufacturing job share at a furious rate. Yes, the spread between the incomes of the    and the   has widened massively. Yes, the spread between the incomes of even the   and our overclass has exploded.  But this is not due to NAFTA. This is not due to bringing China into the WTO rather than keeping it out. This is not due to the     —   and now      —   TPP.              Try to calculate the share that those three “bad trade agreements” played in the processes of manufacturing job loss, of widening income inequality, and the coming of the overclass of the Second Gilded Age, and  —   as long as you calculate honestly  —   you get a share of responsibility of less than 5 percent, and usually less than 1 percent. This is what caused a populist backlash? To defend trade deals is not to say that US economic policy has been without fault To be clear, I do think American international economic policy has been far, far from perfect. I could rant with the best of them about our failure to be a   nation financing the industrialization of the world, a role from which we would ultimately benefit both economically and politically. I can rant about our reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of the global treasures that are our communities of engineering practice. It is no accident that spinning machines were made in Lowell, Massachusetts; that automobiles were made in Detroit; minicomputers were made along Route 128, Massachusetts; that programs are written in Silicon Valley; and that hoverboards are made in Shenzhen, China. A community of engineers, technicians, and businesses that have seen the problems and methods of an industry up close and who know how to solve them is an incredibly valuable and    economic resource. We should not “protect” such communities regardless of cost, but we should nurture them.    I also believe that a rich country like the US should be saving more than it invests here at home: It is poor countries that need to invest more than they save. And the US should be taking that extra savings  —   the part that’s in excess over investment  —   and lending it out in dollars to poor countries where capital is scarce. Those countries should then be taking those dollars and using them to buy the capital goods from us that they need to equip their workers. They would be buying those machines from firms embedded in our communities of engineering practice, thereby profiting US companies.  The US should be running not a trade deficit but a trade surplus, as do the other two leading industrial powers, Japan and Germany. And to the extent that American workers share in the surplus created by healthy communities of engineering practice  —   which they always have, to a significant extent  —   this is good not just for the world economy as a whole but for US workers too. And in order to run that trade surplus, the US should be facilitating manufacturing production and exports by following not a   policy but an   policy. A strong dollar is not in America’s interest if it means market prices are sending the wrong signals. An overly strong dollar tells   manufacturing and other industries that they are not useful to society. It signals to businesses that they should disrupt these communities and outsource more of their work. And that does serious damage. So yes, I acknowledge US economic policy has been far from perfect. It has been far from perfect over the past 40 years in its macroeconomic stance  —   the Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts, the belief that less regulation of finance in New York is always good, the belief that the value of the dollar is how we keep score. But the     TPP? NAFTA? And  ? They are not big parts of any picture. They are not a big part of the   decline in the manufacturing job share. Indeed, they barely register among the flaws in US international economic policy. By and large, the jobs that we shed as a result of NAFTA and   were   jobs that we did not really want. Because of NAFTA and   we have been able to buy a lot of good stuff much cheaper  —   which means we have had more income to spend on other things and to pay people to do other, more useful things than work on     assembly lines. Skeptical? I understand. But leave me space to make my argument, and I will return to this point later.    We have not done our proper job in cushioning the incomes of and providing opportunities to those people and communities that have found themselves behind the   in sectors flooded by imports as other countries industrialize (especially China). But NAFTA and   look, to me, like things that have been broadly good for the American economy.  And they have been even better for America as the world’s dominant superpower. A Mexico that is helped by the United States makes life here more comfortable than a deeply impoverished Mexico. China is likely to be   with the US as a superpower by the end of this century; enmeshing it in our economy starting now is the best move in a   plan to make that equality one of partnership and alliance rather than competition and cold war. But I digress. Back to my main thread: Why do I think that what I say is the economic policy truth is in fact the truth? Here is the story as I see it: Most of the decline in the manufacturing employment share was inevitable The elephant in the room is the collapse over the past three generations of the manufacturing employment share here in America.  A manufacturing job making things in a factory is no longer, in any sense, a typical job for Americans. A sector of the economy that provided three out of 10 nonfarm jobs at the start of the 1950s and one in four nonfarm jobs at the start of the 1970s now provides fewer than one in 11 nonfarm jobs today. Proportionally, the United States has shed almost   of relative manufacturing employment since 1971:    var embedDeltas=chart=document. getElementById(”  ”),chartWidth=chart. offsetWidth, applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math. min( 1000, Math. max( 100*(Math. floor( )) 100))]||0, newHeight=applyDelta;chart. style. height=newHeight+”px”;  I am at heart an economic historian. So stepping back to place our current   debate over trade policy in a   century perspective is not enough for me. I want to go back 100 times as far: back to the invention of agriculture.    From that    perspective, the past   of a century’s relative shift of jobs out of what we call manufacturing  —   a word that in its origins is Latin for ”making things with our hands”  —   is just the latest of a number of shifts that have taken place.  First, we lost a great many jobs in hunting and gathering, as agriculture and herding animals came in.  Second, with the domestication of the horse around 2000 BC, we started the process of losing the jobs that involved dragging heavy things around: Horses could pull more and could be largely paid in grass. (A bonus: They found the grass themselves.)  Third, the arrival of first practical and then theoretical understanding of what was up with nitrogen in the soil and plant growth started the process of losing jobs in agriculture: Each farmer could do more. That process has carried farmers down from   of the labor force to as small a proportion today as ”gardeners, groundskeepers, and growers of ornamental plants,” according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Fourth, the coming of   and then   spinning and weaving destroyed millions of home craftwork jobs  —   and sent the family of future Gilded Age robber baron steelmaster Andrew Carnegie fleeing from a Scotland ridden by death by starvation to the United States.   In each case, advancing technology enabled us to make vital things with less human time and energy; demand for those vital things by those with money to spend did not expand enough to preserve all the jobs. Now, for the past   of a century, it has been the turn of   manufacturing jobs to vanish. To be the beneficiaries of such a process is a very good thing: Lots more good stuff becomes available at a cheaper price. The $100 billion    dollars we spent on food in 1960, for example, amounted to 20 percent of everything the US made. The $1. 5 trillion of    dollars we spend on food today is only 8 percent of everything we make. And more than $300 billion of our annual food budget today is for food processing that is paid for today but that was done unpaid by wives, mothers, sisters, and daughters back in 1960. To be caught up as a victim of such a process of displacement  —   to be a farmer who loses his job because the economy is getting more efficient at producing food  —   is a bad thing. It’s not just that you need to find another job. It’s that you need to find another kind of job. You may well not be prepared or equipped for it. And it changes who you are. And that is if you can find another job The research suggests, however, that when the economy is doing well  —   a key point  —   and the plant you work in shuts down, you do, indeed, take a hit, but it is not necessarily a staggering hit. Your income over the next 20 years turns out to be about 10 percent lower than the income of similarly situated people who are not caught in a mass layoff. You don’t, as a rule, permanently go from a $   manufacturing job to a $   McDonald’s job.    In short, those whose jobs vanish usually find something else to do that does not involve too much downward mobility, whether in income or status. And the benefits of cheap goods are, usually, not overly concentrated among the already rich.  All Americans benefit from inexpensive food, after all, and inexpensive TVs and other goods.   And the process could always be made   for everybody. We can, collectively, at least in theory, have everything we had before, plus more. Figuring out how to distribute the fruits of the useful work we do in an equitable manner is a problem of societal organization that ought not to be beyond our abilities to solve. However, a lot of work must be done here by the word ”could” in the previous paragraph, and by the concept of ”net” benefits. Nevertheless, in American politics in 2016, the talk is not about how to better manage a   process of structural economic transformation. In American politics in 2016, the talk is instead truthy talk about the villainy of NAFTA in 1993, the offense of China joining the WTO in 2001, and the theoretical disaster of TPP.  Have trade agreements driven this process of shedding manufacturing jobs in America? And would abrogating NAFTA, withdrawing from the WTO, and not ratifying the TPP be appropriate and sufficient policy responses to the shedding of manufacturing jobs?  The clear and obvious answer is: no. Germany is widely believed to have a   manufacturing sector, yet it has seen the same pattern as the US Consider a country that has, everyone agrees, done everything right as far as nurturing its manufacturing sector is concerned: Germany. High national savings lent abroad, which provides foreigners with the deutsch marks (and now euros) to purchase German manufactures? Check. Eschewing a    (now euro) policy to make its goods affordable? Check. Nurturing communities of engineering expertise through heavily subsidized apprenticeship and technical training programs? Check. Germany today is the manufacturing export powerhouse of the world.     Yet here’s the share of German employment in manufacturing since 1971:  var embedDeltas=chart=document. getElementById(”  ”),chartWidth=chart. offsetWidth, applyDelta=embedDeltas[Math. min( 1000, Math. max( 100*(Math. floor( )) 100))]||0, newHeight=applyDelta;chart. style. height=newHeight+”px”;  Now you can say  —   correctly and truly  —   that   of that shedding by Germany of its manufacturing job share is a special case: It took place in the first half of the 1990s, when the German East was absorbed and Germany was unified:     That unification era saw an enormous   structural change, as the inefficient     jobs of the communist factories of East Germany proved uncompetitive on the world market. Factories shut, shedding workers and releasing them for other, more societally productive uses elsewhere in the economy. Before the Berlin Wall came down, East Germany’s manufacturing was heavily protected by the tariff barriers thrown up by Russia’s counterpart to the European Union free trade zone, COMECON. It was further protected by the barriers thrown up by East Germany’s communist centrally planned allocation economy: Even if it were cheaper to buy manufactured goods outside of East Germany, you could do so only if the planners allowed it (and they would not). When those artificial supports for bad businesses disappeared, did East Germany’s workers move on to more productive work? Yes, most of them did. Many moved to West Germany and its more robust economy. Some, however, did not. And enough wound up on the dole that the sociological aftershocks are still being felt today: Even 25 years later, unemployment in the former East Germany is 3 percentage points higher than unemployment in the former West Germany. But consider this too: An East Germany that was only 40 percent as well off as West Germany in 1989 is now 80 percent as well off as West Germany. It is very hard to say that the shedding of inefficient, unproductive, and   manufacturing jobs was a minus for East Germans. Back to the US: In 1953, lower productivity (compared with today) meant that many more workers were needed to make each car, each refrigerator, each chair. That kept US manufacturing large in terms of employment. Tariff barriers and high transportation and distribution costs, relative to today, meant that there were very few opportunities for American firms to offshore manufacturing in an efficient way. Just as in Germany after 1989, the overwhelming bulk of the shedding of the US manufacturing share of employment since the 1950s is the result of two things:    1. Rising productivity in the face of limited demand: Nobody needs two dining room tables  —   which now take fewer workers to create  —   and even though my wife and I find that we ”need” two refrigerators, we are weird. This is big.  2. Reductions in transportation costs that allow producers elsewhere that used to be unable to serve the US market to do so. (Reductions in   tariff and   barriers play a very soft second fiddle here.) Those foreign producers then use the dollars they earn to buy other US made products produced in other sectors of manufacturing, or in services. This is, compared with the first factor, small. Over all, the shedding of   jobs that results from those two trends is a good thing. But how much of a role in “bad” job shedding did NAFTA and China joining the WTO play? And how to distinguish between “good” and “bad” shedding?  Using Germany as a yardstick One possible baseline, given how many people hold up Germany as a model for the way it has protected its manufacturing, is to assume that under the best policies, the US would have matched Germany. It would have shed about 50 percent of its manufacturing job share since 1971, rather than the 62 percent that we did shed. That would have given the US today manufacturing employment equal to 12. 2 percent rather than 8. 6 percent of nonfarm employment. That represents a gap between reality and one theoretical alternative world of 5. 4 million manufacturing jobs. Call that the excess shrinkage of US manufacturing. I am probably an outlier among neoliberal and neoclassical economists in thinking that most of that shedding  —   US job shedding that exceeded German job shedding  —   was bad. (Others believe that it was efficient.) Remember: I believe that under proper economic policies, the US should be saving more than it is investing at home and so helping finance the development of the rest of the world, that it should eschew the strong dollar, and should do more to nurture and support its incredibly valuable communities of engineering practice. And pursuing such goals would have kept the manufacturing job share higher than some neoliberals believe ideal. But such policies would not have kept the manufacturing job share at the 24 percent of 1971, or the 30 percent of 1950.              But 12. 2 percent seems to me something that could have been attained in a different world  —   one without the Reagan and W tax cuts, without the consequent Reagan and W Bush budget deficits, one without the overlong   policy and the encouragement of excessive financialization of the economy, and one with proper attention to how manufacturing (and engineering, and design) matters. That different world would be a better one.    But how much of that gap between American and German performance was caused by NAFTA? Examining the NAFTA case more closely Recall that the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement:  Immediately eliminated tariffs on 50 percent of industrial goods imported into Mexico from the US Set a   timetable for phasing out most tariffs  —   and a   timetable for phasing out all tariffs  —   among Mexico, the US, and Canada. Before NAFTA, Mexican tariffs averaged 10 percent and US tariffs averaged 4 percent. Eliminated a slew of Mexican protectionist measures: requirements that the government had to approve certain classes of imports; local content quotas, requirements that Mexican firms meet targets for export performance Most importantly, gave Mexico guaranteed   and   access to the largest consumer market in the world, thus eliminating the principal cause of uncertainty that made investors leery of putting their money into the steel and concrete and machines bolted to the floor that are Mexican factories.  Back in 1992, when Republican George H. W. Bush was negotiating NAFTA, Ross Perot claimed that NAFTA would lead to a ”giant sucking sound” as businesses moved huge numbers of jobs from the US to Mexico. But did NAFTA drive any rise in the unemployment rate? No. The years after NAFTA’s implementation were the best as far as unemployment is concerned of any since the early 1970s. Did NAFTA drive the fall in the manufacturing employment share? No. Before NAFTA was signed, we were already   of the way from July 1953 to our present state in terms of “losing” manufacturing jobs. We were   of the way from January 1971 to our present state. Even the best policies favorable to nurturing a country’s manufacturing sector would not have prevented this process of the shedding of relatively inefficient manufacturing jobs. The trend preceded NAFTA, and it would have continued with or without NAFTA.    Even the work of   economists demonstrates this. The most thoughtful and careful think tank that is skeptical of globalization is Larry Mishel’s Economic Policy Institute. Its estimates are the most aggressive credible ones of deleterious effects of NAFTA. Writing for EPI, Robert Scott ascribes the shedding of 420, 000 manufacturing jobs to the growth of trade with Mexico since the passage of NAFTA. As best as I can figure out from the more detailed numbers he provides, his estimates imply that manufacturing industries in which we are net exporters to Mexico gained about 300, 000 jobs, and manufacturing industries in which we are not importers from Mexico lost about 700, 000 jobs. That would imply a net loss of 400, 000 jobs. But in Scott’s view, roughly 300, 000 of the manufacturing jobs displaced by the pattern of growing trade with Mexico are not net reductions in total US jobs. They are, rather, shifts in net jobs from manufacturing to other sectors. In normal times, the Federal Reserve responds to overall employment declines by cutting interest rates to boost employment in other sectors, and thus the job displacement in traded goods is roughly offset by job growth elsewhere in the economy. Scott suggests that the Fed did this job reasonably well at least until 2007, by which point, because of the financial crisis, it had lowered interest rates as far as they could go; after 2007, it could offer no useful stimulus. In the end, in Scott’s view, there remain ”116, 400 US jobs displaced . .. between 2007 and 2010. .. [which are] net job losses for the entire economy.” In other words, in a world without NAFTA there would have been 116, 400 more available positions in 2010. 116, 400 jobs amounts to less than 0. 1 percent of the US labor force. Particular industries were supposed to have been placed under dire threat by competition from Mexico, most especially autos and auto parts. Both Ross Perot and his   Harley Shaiken, a Berkeley colleague of mine, put the auto industry at the top of their “endangered jobs” lists. Mexico, they said, had   workers earning low wages in auto assembly plants, and the US simply would not be able to compete. But in the three years after NAFTA was implemented, employment in the American automotive industry grew by 14. 1 percent, worker hourly earnings grew by 5. 6 percent, and Ford, Chrysler, and GM invested $39. 1 billion in new manufacturing plants and equipment in the US  —   and only $3 billion in Mexico. What seems to have happened is that the North American auto industry reacted to NAFTA by rationalizing itself  —   moving those parts of it that could be effectively performed by relatively   workers to Mexico, and thus gaining a cost advantage    European and Japanese producers. As the trade economist Sherman Robinson and his   wrote, there was:    a dramatic increase in [North American]   trade in autos and parts. ... [Economic] efficiency gains from finer specialization. .. [that] do not appear to be “Ricardian,” in that they are not primarily based on. .. [exploiting low wages] but “Smithian” in the sense that NAFTA widened the extent of the market and permitted increasing returns to finer specialization. Most fears about the ill effects of NAFTA on the U. S. auto industry, whether in term of employment, wages, or investment, have been proven wrong. .. And do note that trade with Mexico would have grown and grown in a similar pattern without NAFTA  —   merely to a slightly lesser extent. I believe Scott is aware of this overarching trend: His report is subtitled “  Trade and Job Displacement after NAFTA,” rather than something like ”Trade and Job Displacement because of NAFTA. ” Thus the   credible estimate is that NAFTA produced a shedding of 200, 000 manufacturing jobs. That represents:  0. 14   of nonfarm employment   of the excess shedding of the manufacturing job share   of the total shedding of the manufacturing job share since 1971  In the context of all the forces and disruptions affecting the US economy and the US distribution of income and wealth over the past   NAFTA was and is simply not a very big deal. And there are important benefits from NAFTA. The higher real incomes we get from having Mexico as a more prosperous trading partner  —   because our dollars buy more goods, since those goods are cheaper  —   make up one set of benefits. Other sets of benefits are at least as important. The biggest of them is that we need to do what we can to make a peaceful world. It is part of the US’s job as a superpower to extend a helping hand so that Mexico can become richer faster. A world in which schoolchildren in the future are taught  —   truly  —   that America did all it could to close off economic opportunities to others and keep them poor and barefoot is unlikely to be a safe world for Americans. And it makes us into a worse America as well. But what about China? In the decade from 1991 to 2001, the year China joined the WTO, the Chinese economy sat up: US imports from China increased from $20 billion at 2007 prices  —   0. 6 percent of the market in the US for manufactured goods  —   to $120 billion, 2. 3 percent of the market. And then in the   from 2001 to 2007, the Chinese economy stood up: US imports of Chinese goods surged from $120 to $320 billion at 2007 prices  —   from 2. 4 percent to 5. 8 percent of the US manufactured goods market. This is, potentially, a bigger deal than NAFTA occurring in a shorter time: three times as large an increase in manufactured goods imports as in Mexico in less than half the time. This is the ”China shock.”    The MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and his colleagues attribute the loss of 560, 000 American jobs to the China shock. Once again, the   shedding of manufacturing jobs is overwhelmingly a job shift rather than a job loss. The people who lose jobs in   manufacturing and leave the sector for the most part found jobs elsewhere  —   in services, in construction, and so forth. The Federal Reserve was trying to, and largely succeeding at, nailing the unemployment rate to 5 percent, its estimate of what the American economy could sustain without causing undue inflation. It was not until 2008 the Federal Reserve was tapped out, in the sense that it was unable or unwilling to adopt policies that it expected to return the economy to full employment within a couple of years. So as far as net job losses are concerned  —   as opposed to the redistribution of jobs  —   we are talking about what has happened since 2008. Once again, remember that manufactured goods imports from China would have surged substantially even had China not joined the WTO  —   the development that Donald Trump claims ”enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.” Even a China that had not joined the WTO would have industrialized, and exported. Therefore, I think it is not unreasonable to take the true numbers to be half those of Acemoglu et al. Halving his figures, we find that because China joined the WTO, the US has 200, 000 more jobs in manufacturing industries that export to China, and 500, 000 fewer manufacturing jobs in industries where China exports to the US. The net loss is 300, 000.  That represents 0. 22 percentage points of nonfarm employment. That is   of the excess shedding  —  beyond what Germany experienced over the same period  —   of the manufacturing job share. That is   of the total shedding of the manufacturing job share since 1971. Once again, not a big deal. The   Partnership: RIP, TPP The   Partnership, it is now clear, will never happen. None of the geopolitical gains for which it was negotiated will come to pass. Nor will any job losses.  Had TPP gone into effect, it would not have done nearly as much as NAFTA or China’s accession to the WTO did to reduce the costs and frictions that other countries face when they ship their manufactured goods to the United States.  What TPP would have done was:  Reassure countries in Asia that the US was interested in giving them options other than becoming part of China’s economic sphere  —   and, eventually, security sphere Give US owners of intellectual property  —   cough, pharma, cough, Hollywood  —   more legal tools to extract high rents from consumers and punish intellectual property piracy (or, if you think, as I do, that patent and copyright terms are already too long, ”piracy”) on the other side of the Pacific. Set in stone rules about what rights companies had when governments took steps that they saw as unfairly penalizing them  —   rules that were almost surely not the best, and that we would want to modify in a decade or so when we had more experience Do a little bit  —   less than NAFTA  —   to reduce existing trade barriers   I was a weak TPP opponent: 1 and 4 seemed to me to be good things, 3 seemed to be a bad thing, and 2 was a good thing for US intellectual property owners but a bad thing from my perspective as a rootless global cosmopolite. Adding up the effects of the   trade agreements The relative decline in employment in manufacturing since World War II is the biggest structural change, or evolution, to hit the American economy over the past  . Politicians, with their preference for truthiness over the facts, attribute roughly all the 22 percentage point decline since 1971 in the manufacturing employment share to NAFTA, to China’s entry into the WTO, and to a few other scattered ”corporately backed unfettered free trade agreements. ” But  —   I really would like to drive this home  —   the worrisome part from trade is not the decline in the manufacturing job share from 30 percent to 12. 2 percent, but the ”excess” decline from 12. 2 percent to 8. 6 percent. That worrisome part of the decline of the manufacturing job share is, roughly, only   of the total decline: 3. 6 percentage points. And the amount of decline attributable to the two big bad trade agreements is only   of that: 0. 36 percentage points.  In sum, we can attribute a mere   of the excess reduction relative to Germany in the manufacturing job share to NAFTA and to China joining the WTO.  When does it hurt most to be pushed out of manufacturing? Simply to no longer be working in manufacturing, or to not get your first job in manufacturing, or to not have the career in manufacturing you expected, is not by itself a bad thing. For many, the disappearance of   jobs is lived as being pulled out into a better alternative job rather than being pushed out into a worse one. Moreover, even if you keep your   manufacturing jobs, under what conditions do you keep them? Wage concessions under pressure from foreign competition have been a fact of   factory life in America since the coming of the Reagan tax cuts for the rich  —   since the era of budget deficits and the elevated dollar.  In figuring out the economic effects on human beings of job shedding, economists Steven Davis and Till von Wächter, of Stanford and UCLA, are the   guys. They looked at firings as opposed to quits (since one reason you might quit is that your outside options are good) and mass layoffs rather than individual firings (for in mass layoffs there is surely no possibility that every worker affected is unusually unproductive). They find that if you lose your job in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate is less than 6 percent, your income over the next 20 years will be   lower than if you’d avoided getting caught up in the mass layoff. That’s three years’ worth of expected wages that you will lose over that period.   In short, for the typical American, getting caught in economic destruction  —   creative or not  —   is a big and bad deal, if not a   one. It is right and normal that people should be upset at getting caught up on the downside of the industrial evolution and structural transformation of the economy. And Americans have every right to demand that the government do something about it  —   not to freeze the relative distribution of jobs across sectors and industries at what it was in 1953 or 1971, but to make sure that those who lose out as a result of economic evolution and structural change are compensated reasonably. What form might this compensation take? It is the big missing ingredient in helping to “sell” and keep selling trade deals. But even thinking about this is hobbled by the fact that the response to such offers of compensation is often: We don’t want “burial insurance. ” People often don’t want compensation; they want things restored to the way they used to be. But it’s important to note just how crucial the overall macroeconomic context can be when it comes to job losses. What if you are fired in a mass layoff when the unemployment rate is more than 8 percent? Then your income over the next 20 years will fall by more than twice as much as it would have in a   economy. Such workers will lose fully six years’ worth of expected wages over that period. When unemployment is high, finding another job quickly is very difficult, and long periods in which you have not been working are taken  —   sometimes rightly, often wrongly  —   by employers as a sign that you are not a worker they want around. Thus, keeping the unemployment rate reliably below 6 percent and avoiding at all costs episodes in which the unemployment rate spikes above 8 percent would be a very effective trade adjustment policy. It’s one reason few people complained about NAFTA as its implementation took hold in the   late 1990s. Unfortunately for those caught up in the general process of the shrinkage of manufacturing, most of the job losses took place in   recession years. Shifting 22 percent of America’s nonfarm labor force out of manufacturing, as has occurred since 1971, is not chopped liver: It has had major effects on American distribution and growth.  For 22 percent of the labor force to lose an average of, say, five years’ worth of income each is a huge deal. Saying that on net the process is a gain does not absolve anyone of being unprepared to figure out what are the appropriate policies to deal with it. But 98 percent of that shift would have occurred without the   trade agreements.  The effects of NAFTA and   were softened by a tight US economy And fortunately, the principal effects of NAFTA and   on American manufacturing took place in the boom years of the late 1990s and the    years of the  . The 0. 36 percent of the American labor force that was pushed out of manufacturing by NAFTA and   thus lost future income equal to perhaps four years’ earnings. That’s the rough equivalent of 1. 5 percent of one year’s national income. And those losses are, in simple arithmetic at least, almost surely offset by bigger gains to those who get to buy greater quantities of good imported stuff cheap.  Measure this by the yardstick of the economic costs of what we used to think of as a ”normal” business cycle recession, which would steal 12 percent of one year’s American national income  —   eight times as much  —   from us. (And those costs have no upside, unlike trade deals.) Or measure it by the yardstick of the crisis produced by the crash of 2008 and what I am now calling the Longer Depression, which looks likely to rob the world of total wealth equal to 500 percent of one year’s American national income, if not more.  That’s hundreds of times more costly than the trade deals.. It is disturbing that the distributional consequences of the large decline in the manufacturing employment share are being hung on two trade agreements. And, as I have shown, that is utterly unjustified. As I hope I’ve made clear, I do not want to be read as saying that American trade policy has been perfect, or even particularly good.  I could write an entire piece on what has been wrong with America’s international economic policy. But NAFTA and   ain’t it. They are good trade deals. What has gone wrong has been our failure to assume our global responsibilities to be a   nation that helps finance the industrialization of the rest of the world, our willingness to be a bolthole where foreign kleptocrats and others can store their money, our reluctance to properly incentivize the creation and maintenance of our communities of engineering practice, our willingness to use resources provided from abroad to finance consumption by our elite rather than investment in America, and our desire to charge poor people through the nose for access to what we deem ”our” intellectual property. (TPP has, or would have had, a role in the last.) But how one should organize the global economy to properly nurture and develop communities of engineering practice and to move toward an efficient distribution of the work and a less unfair distribution of the wealth of the world economy  —   that is an argument for a different article. So let me break the fourth wall, and say that even though my work here as an economist is done, I find it vitally important that I ask all of you to try to answer a few political and psychological questions:   Why have so many politicians focused on NAFTA, China joining the WTO, and the TPP in debates over economic policy?  Why did left and right combine so vociferously in opposition to NAFTA in 1992 and 1993?  Why is opposition to the TPP so much a litmus test for being a true American  —   rather than some form of oppressive elite rootless cosmopolite  —   for both the left and the right today?   I suspect this is a case of the populist impulse gone badly wrong.  As a rule, it is remarkably hard in America to build any kind of governing or intellectually hegemonic coalition by treating other Americans as enemies. (As I write, Donald Trump and his Republican Party are probing the limits of this rule and whether the rule still holds.) This is a good thing about America. Most Americans, most of the time, regard almost all of the people who live here as their fellows, as   in our common enterprise, our great contract between the dead, the living, and the unborn. We are, in the words of my remote ancestor John Winthrop aboard the Arbella in 1630, engaged in the utopian project of building a City Upon a Hill. And anyone who wants to come and join us and work for it is one of us. Most Americans. Most of the time. But  —   and this is a very important “but”  —   even here in America, you can, as you definitely can elsewhere, mobilize a great deal of populist energy by identifying foreigners as the enemy. I do not think this is an impulse that it is healthy for any part of this country. I do not think this is something any political movement that seeks to do anything other than destroy can dare to encourage. And I now find myself far beyond my competence. So I want to hear from historians, sociologists, political scientists, and cultural studies practitioners about why we have come to obsess about NAFTA, about not blocking China from joining the WTO, and about TPP.  The economic case against the two agreements that passed, and the one that did not, doesn’t hold water. It’s clear, however,  that candidates can make an effective political case against trade agreements  —   and that scares me.

" J. D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy has been adopted as the book that explains Trumpism. It’s the book that both Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rob Portman recommended as their favorite of 2016. It’s a book Rep. Keith Ellison, the frontrunner to lead the Democratic National Committee, brought up in my recent conversation with him. Everyone, on both sides of the aisle, has turned to Vance to explain What It All Means.    All of which is a bit odd, because Vance’s book is an awkward fit with Trumpism. As Vance describes it, it’s about ”what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south. It’s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible. It’s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.”  It’s a memoir about growing up amid a particular slice of the white working class  —   the   who settled in and around Appalachia  —   and the ways that both propelled Vance forward and held him back. It’s a book about one man’s story  —   a story that is universal in some ways, particular in others, but was certainly not written with Donald J. Trump in mind. I spoke with Vance on a recent episode of my podcast (subscribe here! ). Excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follow.      Ezra Klein You’ve written a book that became the book of this election cycle. I opened the New York Times a couple weeks ago and they had folks recommending their best books of the year, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, recommended yours. How do you explain what people saw in Hillbilly Elegy that made it so essential to this moment of upheaval in American life?    J. D. Vance            Part of it is obviously the political moment. Donald Trump became president of the United States, collecting a lot of votes from the white working class, and even though Donald Trump is never mentioned in the book, there’s a fair amount in the book about the political, the economic, the social frustrations of the white working class. So if you’re hoping to read about a group of people that made Donald Trump or helped make Donald Trump president, then my book gets recommended. I think that’s a little bit weird, frankly, given the fact that I really try not to talk about politics too much in the book, but I think folks are just grasping for something to try to understand this political moment, and my book is one of the things that they landed on. And my hope is that the way I talk about these issues, the way I really try to walk somebody through how hard it is to grow up like I did, and to ”make it” in the modern American economy, I’m hopeful that that resonated.    There’s this fear I have that the book will be viewed as this explainer of the Trump phenomenon, which it really isn’t, and that the core message, the real reason I wanted to write it, which was to talk about how difficult these problems really are, gets lost. So I think we’re in this moment where it’s not totally clear what the lasting impact of the book will be, but I hope it’s that third factor, this idea that we need to understand what’s really going on in the lives of some of these   kids. Ezra Klein            I read the book a little bit before Trump became the Republican nominee, and what was striking to me about it then, particularly as it became part of the explanatory toolkit people used for Trump, is that the book is a pretty awkward fit with Trumpism. The explanations you give for things are an awkward fit with where the political class ended up, which is in a sort of Washington   mentality, with the idea that policy has abandoned these Rust Belt towns, that there aren’t enough transfer payments, that there’s not enough energy going into revitalization. The book was very cultural in its analysis. You have this line early on that seemed to act almost as a thesis statement, that this book is about “what goes on in the lives of real people when the industrial economy goes south. It’s about reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible. It’s about a culture that increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.” It seemed like a book that in some ways resisted policy solutionism in a way that seemed unusual to me, and also seems in tension with the political discussion that emerged around it.    J. D. Vance         Well, there’s definitely an element of truth to that. The one part where I’d push back a little bit is that I do think policymakers can do more to address some of these problems, and it’s not that I think government is totally helpless. It’s more that I think government is somewhat helpful and can be part of the solution, but it can’t be the whole solution, and, more importantly, I think that if government tries to fix these problems without policymakers really understanding them, then I think those solutions are almost destined to fail. But there’s definitely something a little bit weird about the way the book has been picked to help explain the Trump phenomenon, because, like you said, at the end of the day my argument is not a robust criticism of American trade policy. It’s not a strong indictment of the economic policies of President Bush or President Obama. Ezra Klein    The book explores resentment you see among the middle class or the working class toward poorer folks. When discussing why the white working class turned toward Republicans, you write: A big part of the explanation lies in the fact that many in the white working class saw precisely what I did, working at Dillman’s. As far back as the 1970s, the white working class began to turn to Richard Nixon because of a perception that, as one man put it, government was “payin’ people who are on welfare today doin’ nothin’! They’re laughin’ at our society! And we’re all hardworkin’ people and we’re gettin’ laughed at for workin’ every day!” One of the arguments in the book, as I understood it, was that the resentment that powered Trumpism is not just a   thing, which I think is how it’s often understood, but is actually a class thing that happens even within mostly white communities from one person to another. J. D. Vance Yeah, that’s definitely a really important part of my thinking. It’s interesting that that passage in the book is sometimes viewed as my criticism of social welfare programs, right? It’s a criticism of food stamps or SNAP or whatever else, and I actually really explicitly meant to be agnostic in that section of the book. I wasn’t saying these programs are good or bad.    The point I was making is that when you see people using these programs in a certain way, it causes a certain social distrust among the people who may be using them or may be not using them, but certainly don’t perceive themselves to be misusing these programs. So I saw this with my grandma, who was a classic Blue Dog Democrat but had grown up in poverty herself, gravitated between working class and impoverished for pretty much her entire life. She had no ideological problem with receiving welfare, and in fact early in her life had been a recipient of welfare herself, but when she saw people buying soda but then selling it at 50 or 60 cents on the dollar to their neighbors so that they could convert those food benefits into cash benefits, it creates a certain amount of social mistrust. And like you said, in our neighborhood it was always white people who were perceived to be misusing these programs. There wasn’t a racial element, at least in my personal experience, with this stuff, just because there weren’t a whole lot of black people shopping at that grocery store. Ezra Klein         Let me ask about how Trump intersects with this. You have a party in the country that is quite focused, particularly when creating transfer programs, on getting as much as possible to the poorest of the poor or the nearly poorest of the poor, and then you have a party in this country that is pretty focused on shrinking the size of government, and Trump walks into the middle of this and offered, I think, a third way. He’s pretty pro —  safety net, pro —  welfare state. He promises not to touch Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid, so he’s not a   guy. His promise, in contrast to the Democrats, is that he’s going to make sure the benefits go to you, the    —   and, I think implicitly, white  —   American, instead of going to, say, these immigrants who are coming across the border.  Where does his story intersect here with yours? J. D. Vance My view on the meaning of Trump is, one, it’s complicated, because    million people voted for him, and I think everybody has a different reason for why they voted for him. But my primary conclusion is that Trump identified a problem, and so he got to name it.  Trump identified these feelings of being left behind and left out, and the thing he named it was, in some cases, maybe a fear of the other, but a core part of Trump’s message, as I understood it, or at least as people back home seemed to be understanding it, is that Trump would bring back jobs, he would bring back good work. Even the immigration issue, whether you agree with him on the policy particulars or not, was framed as a jobs question.     The second thing is this question of who are the others that the benefits of the economy are going to, and the message I was getting from Trump, and certainly the message I was getting from Trump voters, is that the other wasn’t black Americans living in the inner cities, it wasn’t brown Americans immigrating from Mexico  —   it was the elites. It was the Clintons of the world. It was the Jeb Bushes of the world.  Even the way Trump framed this question of the inner cities  —   as being infested with crime and drugs and whatever else  —   a lot of African Americans were rightfully offended by the way he described the inner cities, but even then, it’s not like he was framing black Americans as the winners of the past 15 or 20 years. He was really framing them as the losers in the same way that he was framing the white working class as the losers, so it always occurred to me that the great enemy of Trump’s campaign was never racial minorities. It was always the elites, whoever that is. Ezra Klein There’s long been, in liberal circles, the dream of economic solidarity  —   the idea that there is some way of knitting together a coalition that is the white working class and the multicultural working class, that whether you are working retail in a rural town in Ohio or you’re working retail in Los Angeles, whether you’re white or Hispanic, you’re facing pretty similar issues. Trump was actually able to create, instead of the ”us” of a united working class, a ”them” of elites plus multiculturalism. He certainly wasn’t framing African Americans as the winners of the last couple years, but it was that elites are colluding to create this multicultural America where people are allowed to come across the border because it’s cheap labor for corporations, and you’re the one who’s ending up paying. J. D. Vance             It’s interesting, too, the way the immigration side of this has manifested itself in my own life. I have very close family members who are extremely, one, generous, and two, involved with a family of undocumented immigrants, and these family members are devoted, devoted Trump people, the types of people who have ”Make America Great Again” trucker hats. If you ask these family members of mine why they’re voting for Trump despite the fact that, at least if you take him literally, he may very well deport these people that they consider very close friends and that they love a great deal, the response is always, ”He’s not going to deport them. What he’s going to do is fix the system that forces them to live in the shadows. He’s going to fix the system that allows other people to get ahead of them in line.”     So even when it’s taken to the part of Trump’s message that is explicit as possible, which is that undocumented immigrants are an unacceptable strain on American society, you see his voters reinterpreting it in a way that, whether they’re right or they’re wrong, I think that there’s something actually quite admirable about the way they perceive what he’s going to do and how it motivates their voting. Ezra Klein             There’s a good line  —   and it’s not from me, it’s from someone else  —   that you did not, by any means, need to be a bigot to vote for Donald Trump, and I think the majority of people who did vote for Trump are not bigots, but there are certain things you need to be okay with that were a lot harder for folks of color to treat as lightly. It does take a kind of position of privilege to say, ”Hey, I’m pretty sure that won’t happen, so I’m not going to worry about it.” There is a risk tolerance that, depending on who you are in this discussion, I think, feels very different and can feel very frustrating. I remember thinking a lot during the campaign that if what Trump had said was that Jewish people should not be able to travel to and from the United States, if he had come out and said, ”I’m for a Jewish travel ban,” whatever I thought about him winning, I would have left the country. That speaks to an ancient fear in myself and my people. But a lot of Muslim folks didn’t have that option, and a lot of people around them took it as, ”Oh, take Trump seriously, not literally,” but the question of who gets to decide when he’s serious versus when he’s being literal is, I think, a very hard one. J. D. Vance             Yeah, I agree. The point about risk tolerance for some of the things that Trump said, I think, is a very important one. It’s something I’ve tried to talk about with my family a lot, that if we maybe looked a little bit different, if our names were a little bit different, then maybe we wouldn’t be so tolerant of some of the things he said. We wouldn’t be so willing to cast it aside and say that’s not really what he means or that’s not really what he thinks. The complicating factor, of course, is that people weren’t voting a binary yes or no Trump. They were necessarily voting, if not for Trump, then for Hillary Clinton. The framing I have always had to this is that there’s both a substance and a process element to Trump. There’s the things that he says, the policies, such as they are, that he hopes to enact. That’s the substantive part of Trump, but then there’s the process part of Trump, which is a criticism of the elites, a criticism of the way we engage in political discourse, a criticism, specifically, of the Clintons and especially Hillary Clinton. And my sense is that the process side of Trump was very appealing to a lot of people even as the substantive side of him was at least a little bit disconcerting, even to a lot of his voters. Ezra Klein That’s a very interesting point. I almost want to stop the podcast for 10 minutes and think about it, because there are times when I felt the opposite, where I wondered if somebody with Trump’s ideas and his policies who did not have many of his process and temperamental dimensions wouldn’t have even done better.    I guess one way of thinking about it is, are the people you know, are the people around you, are they upset about the fact that Trump has brought so many folks from Goldman Sachs and CEOs from other companies into his office? If this was a backlash to a globalized elite, it would seem that what he’s doing would anger people, but that’s not really been the feeling I’ve gotten. J. D. Vance      No, that’s not been the feeling I’ve gotten either. There’s always been this element with Trump where a lot of people feel that he’s peeling the onion back and showing them how the world actually works and giving them some perspective into a part of our political and financial process that usually lays hidden.  With Cabinet picks, I’ve never been surprised that they’ve never engendered the backlash that you might suspect. A lot of folks feel like this is the way that business is done. Trump is showing us the processes and the functions of government, and what he’ll ultimately be judged on is if things actually change.  Ezra Klein             To bring Trump back to your book, one of the things that is core to his portrayal of his own life is that he is the agent of his own story, he is the main character, he is somebody who, whatever he decides to do, it just gets done. You write in your book that “whenever people ask me what I’d most like to change about the white working class, I say, ‘The feeling that our choices don’t matter. ’” That struck me as an interesting juxtaposition. The person who, of everybody I’ve ever seen in public life, seems to believe that his personal choices matter the most, is appealing to a group in which, at least as you describe it, is afflicted by a sense that the everyday choices have stopped having meaning. J. D. Vance          I’ve never thought of that before, but it definitely makes a great deal of sense. This is something that I worry a lot about in the book and the way I frame it is a sort of learned helplessness, this constant feeling of being kicked by the economy, by your boss, by your family. I don’t think that view comes from nothing, but it can be pretty   once it sets in.     It is fascinating to think of Donald Trump as a sort of clarion call against that  . And yeah, there’s something powerful about feeling a little hopeless and a little powerless in your own life but then seeing this political figure who explains why you feel hopeless and powerless but is so powerful in his own right. Ezra Klein              One of the things your book is talking about is that not all white people are the same. Your book is talking about a particular lineage of   folks who settled primarily in certain parts of the country, have distinct cultural markers and patterns than other people do, and have not done as well,  . So when they hear about white privilege, they think, ”Fuck you. Nothing about my community says to me that I’m privileged and should be at the back of the line for getting some help here.” I’m curious how you think about that playing out and how you hear it in the conversation. J. D. Vance            First of all, I think it’s one of the ways that the thesis of the book, or at least some of the background arguments I make in the book, is really relevant to the 2016 election. I remember right after the Iowa primary, a political scientist did basically an ethnographic breakdown of Trump versus Cruz versus Rubio in the Iowa caucuses, and what he found  —   and I’m going to overstate this, maybe, because I haven’t seen this study in nearly a year  —   is that one of the, if not the biggest, correlations to Trump support was identifying as   or one of its derivatives.  I really thought that was a massively underreported part of this election cycle. I really think that’s why he won Pennsylvania, Michigan, and, to a smaller extent, Wisconsin  —   if you look at the migration patterns, the white   populations of those areas are heavily  .  But to connect it to the conversation about white privilege, I think it’s always important to note that there are obviously still advantages to being white, there are still disadvantages to being black, even when you control completely for class, income, and so forth. But one of the points I tried to make is that if you’re asking the son of an unemployed West Virginia coal miner to check his privilege or to appreciate the ways in which, let’s say, Barack Obama’s daughters are going to be privileged or underprivileged relative to him in certain ways, I think that you’re asking just too much from basic human cognition. That kid cannot look at his life and say about a group of people that he doesn’t understand, that he doesn’t even interact with a lot day to day, that their lives are much worse than his, and I think that’s one of the things that the modern discourse around racial privilege and racial disadvantage misses. I don’t think most of the people making these arguments are that reductive, I think they’re a lot more sophisticated in what they’re saying [about] how privilege operates along different dimensions in our society, but the way it’s actually talked about appears very reductive, and I think that’s a really significant problem.    Ezra Klein              You have a stat in the book that   whites are currently the most pessimistic group in America. You write that “they’re more pessimistic than Latino immigrants, many of whom suffer unthinkable poverty. They’re more pessimistic than black Americans whose material prospects continue to lag behind those of whites. ” If you are a white kid whose father is unemployed and you’re in a struggling   community, and you’re turning on the television and the president is an African American, and you’re looking at sitcoms and they’re suddenly much, much, much more diverse and nobody you see talks like you do, nobody has the accent you do, nobody has the cultural markers you do, it’s hard, then, to hear that white privilege is the problem.      On the other hand, you could not have somebody like Trump, but was African American, elected president in this country. He is walking white privilege.  J. D. Vance             The problem, as I see it, is that we haven’t necessarily developed a great vocabulary to describe disadvantage in a newer, much more culturally diverse country.  One of the things I hope that a reader of my book will take away is that it really operates among multiple different axes, so it’s a function of where you grew up, it’s a function of whether you grew up in concentrated poverty, it’s a function of your race, it’s a function of your class, it’s a function of the education level of your parents, it’s a function of how much childhood trauma you faced, it’s a function of whether your parents are single or still married. I really think we have to catch our collective vocabulary up to the real complexity of these problems, because if we don’t, we’re left effectively talking about the issue in incredibly reductive ways that, one, isn’t helpful for the reasons you describe, but two, I really think discolors the public debate in a certain way. It’s not just that talking to that kid about white privilege is not an especially useful way to understand his real disadvantage. It’s that it actually makes it harder for him to see the disadvantages that other people face.     Ezra Klein           Let me ask you about the other side of this. I hear everything you just said there, and then you talk to somebody who’s African American and they say the quantity of cultural sympathy that is being directed toward Trump voters is overwhelming. The idea that they always need to be understood better, that there need to be more and more and more sympathetic profiles, that’s not true for folks who were followers, say, of Louis Farrakhan, who also had his bigoted moments but was speaking to a very real sense of cultural dislocation and economic anxiety and frustration and feeling that communities are falling apart. Or, even less provocatively, that’s not true folks who are seeing police brutality in a pretty routine way in their communities, or who look at the studies and see that if you’ve got a stereotypically   name you’re just less likely to be called back for a job. All of a sudden when it’s a problem for a traditionally powerful community, there needs to be a level of precision that the marginalized community never got and a level of sympathy they never got, and that holds back the conversation in a different way. J. D. Vance        One of the things I try to do in my book is to be very sympathetic about the way in which these various structural problems make it very hard on the white   community, but also to be a little bit hardheaded about the ways in which white   Americans  —   not all of them, of course, not even most of them, but certainly some of them  —   have reacted to these problems in a very negative way. And I think if we have sympathy completely disconnected from moral judgment, I don’t think it’s real sympathy. I think it’s basically the sympathy of an outsider that’s condescending to make people feel good.  The way I see that in the   community is almost the exact opposite, so typically if we talk about culture in the black community, at least with regards to the problems of the black community, it’s almost always in this morally condemnatory way  —   it’s like, let’s look at these pathological black people and all of the problems that their culture causes them. And I think that way of talking has been incredibly destructive, and it’s been destructive in two separate ways. One, it’s allowed us to ignore the problems of black Americans where we should be really paying attention to them, and two, I think it has caused us to talk about culture in a way that’s about judgment and blame and not about understanding. Because I think if you look at some of the best sociologists and political scientists and so forth who are writing on this, William Julius Wilson, Robert Putnam, these guys are worried about culture; they’re just not worried about culture in a way that necessarily percolates to the standard everyday political conversation. So I think that’s a real casualty of the way that we’ve typically talked about   black pathology in the inner cities.    To tie all this up, my view of this is that we should continue to offer sympathetic but   looks at the white   community, and we should maybe pair that with more sympathetic views of what’s going on in the black community. Ezra Klein              I think one thing that is a contributor here is that we have trouble talking about problems that are  . We have a language for economic problems, but particularly when it comes to people discussing what’s happening in white   communities, a lot of the problems are not the ones that come through first on an economic test. There are things showing that Trump voters had a higher median income than the average American household, and that doesn’t mean that their communities don’t have problems, but it does make a straightforward discussion of economic anxiety a little bit hard. You gave an interview to Slate, and you had a really nice language around this, I thought, where you talked about social and cultural anxiety, and for these communities you diagnosed it as a feeling that “the world around you is falling apart. It’s not just you can’t find a good job, but that your kids are dying of opioid overdoses, that your families are breaking apart, that churches are not really present in your community, that you can’t trust the media. ” I think we have a difficult time measuring and discussing more complex, multifaceted forms of breakdown, where we can’t just say, ”Hey, look, the unemployment rate has gone up to 9. 6 percent, and so there’s clearly a crisis here.”  J. D. Vance           I agree 100 percent with that. And I think a lot about why that is, about why we’re so bad about talking about   problems, and I think it’s partially just a symptom of the fact that our public discourse is really dominated by what I’ll call the technocratic left and the libertarian right, and so we want to see these problems purely in terms of rational actors responding to incentives.  If you’re not talking about social and cultural capital, if you’re not talking about the role of religion, which can be either positive or negative in these communities, as I write about, if you’re not talking about the role of childhood trauma and family instability, these are things that are real, and if you look at the data they definitely affect these kids’ life prospects. If you look at a study like Raj Chetty’s, for example, he did this huge study on equality of opportunity in the United States, and you can make a very good argument that the two most important things he identified as driving mobility differences were social capital and family breakdown. Ezra Klein There’s a dimension of the technocratic left, and I’ll use Hillary Clinton here as an example, that is very focused on these problems but cannot seem to communicate effectively about them.    I interviewed Clinton during the campaign, and a question I asked her was to name some of her favorite books. And the two books she named that she was thinking about a lot on the campaign trail were Robert Putnam’s Our Kids  —   which is a deep, ethnographic look at the ways in which culture and lived experience and community are really tearing apart the futures for kids who are born in poor communities and kids of all races  —   and Habits of the Heart, which is all about community breakdown, about the role religion does or doesn’t play in our lives.  Trump, I think, has no idea that Robert Putnam has written a book called Our Kids and is not deeply thoughtful, frankly, on a lot of the way these things overlap and interact, but he had some capacity to say, ”I am on your side,” and that was what people responded to.  J. D. Vance             Well, I definitely agree with you that this capacity to form a connection is one of the clear critical problems that a lot of our politicians face these days. It strikes me that not spending a lot of time in these areas, not living in these areas, not campaigning in these areas, that sort of drives the difficulty in connecting. And to put a very fine point on it, I think just because of the way    elites educate themselves, the way they intermarry, the way they work and where they live and so forth, is just really driving this wedge further and further.  It may not be that Hillary Clinton could have solved the problem by campaigning more in rural Pennsylvania or suburban southwest Ohio. The problem may just be that she spent so long among a certain class of society, and that class of society is just not good at emotionally connecting with another class of society  —   and here I’m speaking of the elites versus the broad middle  —   and I unfortunately just do not have the answer to that problem. It’s something that really, really bothers me  —   this fear that those who are doing especially well in our society, for one reason or another, that they’ve lost touch with those who don’t feel that they’re doing especially well in our society. "
" The slender American woman in the black abaya looks directly at the camera, her two children, their faces caked with dirt, sitting just to her left.    “Today is December 3, 2016. We have waited since 2012 for someone to understand our problems, the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves,” she says in the video released by her captors in Afghanistan late last year. “My children have seen their mother defiled. We ask, in our collective 14th year of prison, that the governments on both sides reach some agreement to allow us freedom. ” Then, aiming her words squarely at President Obama, she adds one more message. “Your legacy on leaving us is probably important to you as our lives and those of our children are to us,” she says, reading from the prepared text in her hands. “So please don’t become the next Jimmy Carter. Just give the offenders something so they and you can save face and we can leave the region permanently. ”    The woman is a Pennsylvania resident named Caitlan Coleman, and she, her husband, and their two young sons have been held by the Taliban for more than four years. The family are the   of the handful of Americans known to still be in militant hands there. (The family of American writer Paul Overby revealed in January that he has been missing since May 2014, while the Taliban just released a new video of US academic Kevin King and his Australian colleague Timothy Weeks, whom they kidnapped in August 2016, tearfully pleading for their lives.)     We know Coleman’s name, and we know the name of her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle. But we don’t the names of her sons, both of whom were born in Taliban captivity. The children have likely never met other Americans or read any   books. In the video, the older boy, believed to be about 4, is holding on to his brother, thought to be around 2. At one point the older child laughs and smiles at someone off camera, who promptly shushes him. When we think about US hostages in Afghanistan and Pakistan, many of us think about Bowe Bergdahl, the US soldier who walked off his base and was snatched by the Taliban in 2009 before being freed in a controversial prisoner swap in 2014. Bergdahl was the subject of the most recent season of the popular Serial podcast; during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump called him a “a “dirty rotten traitor” who should have been executed for walking away from his Army post voluntarily before being kidnapped.    The Coleman saga has unfolded very differently. It begins with a risky decision by an idealistic couple seeking one last big adventure before becoming parents, and continues through years of bureaucratic indecision and infighting by a US government deeply divided over how far to go to try to get them back. The Pentagon has a longstanding policy of doing everything possible to get missing troops back, even if it means swapping prisoners. The US government, by contrast, has an equally longstanding policy of refusing to negotiate with terror groups or to pay ransoms to buy the release of American civilian captives. Until recently, the families of missing US citizens were sometimes even told that they could be prosecuted under federal law  —   and potentially jailed  —   if they paid ransoms on their own.  Caitlan Coleman’s parents have never talked to their daughter’s captors and don’t know the names of their grandchildren. Unlike the families of other missing Americans, they have maintained a deliberately low profile and rarely talk to the media. When I spoke with Jim Coleman, he told me that he and his wife were still dealing with the shock of the new video, but were trying to remain optimistic by focusing on the hope that their daughter was building relationships with the Afghan or Pakistani women living near wherever she’s being held.    ”I like to imagine Caity sitting around knitting with the other women while all of the different kids are playing together,” he told me. “That’s my hope  —   that my grandchildren have other kids around.” The grim reality, though, is that US officials directly involved in the case believe they’d twice come close to nailing down deals that would have brought the family back, only to see those efforts stymied by other parts of the American government. In a previously unreported attempted deal, a Taliban representative told US military negotiators that they’d free the Coleman family in exchange for a ransom of $150, 000. The military passed the details to the FBI, which oversees foreign kidnapping cases involving US citizens, but the agency never followed up.   The question now is whether Donald Trump will be willing and able to do what Barack Obama would not: make the type of concessions needed to strike a deal with the Taliban fighters holding the Coleman family. Trump has promised to take a hard line toward Islamist militants around the world. He also fancies himself a   dealmaker, and would love to score some early political wins. It’s hard to imagine a bigger one than being able to welcome a missing American woman and her two children back to the US.  That’s far from guaranteed, however. This is the story of how promising earlier efforts to bring the family back went awry  —   and of why Caitlan Coleman, Joshua Boyle, and their two children remain stuck in Afghanistan in the hands of captors who have threatened to kill them all. A young couple went to Afghanistan. They never came back.             Coleman and Boyle are Star Wars fanatics who first met more than a decade ago on an internet site dedicated to the movies. They were drawn to each other, in part, by a shared love of adventure and a belief that people of all backgrounds were fundamentally good.  “They really and truly believed that if people were loved and treated with respect that that would be given back to them in kind,” Linda Boyle, Joshua Boyle’s mother, told the Associated Press. “So as odd it as it may seem to us that they were there, they truly believed with all their heart that if they treated people properly, they would be treated properly. ”    Their thinking was shaped by the months they’d spent traveling through Latin America and later living among impoverished indigenous people in Guatemala. Their families told the Associated Press that children there started calling Boyle, who was somewhat overweight, “Santa Claus” after he grew his beard out.  The couple got married in Guatemala in 2011; a short time later, Coleman discovered that she was pregnant, news she didn’t share with her parents. Jim and Lynda Coleman didn’t discover the truth until they found a printed sonogram after their daughter went missing in Afghanistan. Coleman and Boyle wanted to have one last adventure before settling into parenthood. In the summer of 2012, they set off on a winding trip that took them through Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan before arriving in Afghanistan that fall. The plan caught her parents off guard.         Lynda Coleman, Caitlan’s mother, told Philadelphia Magazine reporter Holly Otterbein that her daughter had told her parents they’d stay out of the Afghanistan. “They weren’t supposed to go to Afghanistan,” Lynda said. “They promised us they wouldn’t go. ” In the article, a lengthy joint profile of Coleman and Boyle, several of Coleman’s friends and relatives described her as a kindhearted, generous woman who had raised money for the poor in Haiti as a    and then grew into the type of adult who never forgot a birthday or failed to reach out when someone close to her was in need.    Still, they acknowledged that Coleman was also naive and too quick to assume the best about the people around her.  “She always tried to see the best in people,” Julia   a friend of Coleman’s since high school, told Otterbein, “and I guess that’s part of why they ended up where they are. ” Others, particularly in the US military, are even harsher in their assessment of Coleman’s choice to travel to Afghanistan, one of the most dangerous regions in the world, in what would have been the third trimester of her pregnancy. “It’s not just reckless,” one senior officer who served in Afghanistan at the time the family went missing told me. “It’s fucking crazy. ” Coleman, then 26, was due in early January, and she and Boyle, then 29, planned to return home in December so she’d deliver the baby in the US. She never made it: Coleman’s parents last heard from their daughter and    in an October 2012 email Boyle sent from what he described as an ”unsafe” part of Afghanistan.  Boyle was right to worry: Shortly after sending that email, he and Coleman were snatched by the Taliban, the militant Islamist group that has been battling the US since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In 2013, the couple appeared in a pair of propaganda videos asking Washington to do whatever was necessary to free them from Taliban captivity.     Coleman’s parents didn’t see her face again until August 2016, when the Taliban released a video of Coleman and Boyle pleading with the US and Canada to find ways to prevent the Afghan government from executing Taliban prisoners and warning that the militants would kill them and their children if the demands weren’t met.            ”They are willing to kill us, willing to kill women, to kill children, to kill whomever to get these policies reversed or to take revenge,” Coleman says in the video. “Because of this, I ask if my government can do anything to change the policies of the Afghan government, to stop their policy of executing men before these men start executing their prisoners, their family that they are holding.” ”They are willing to kill us, willing to kill women, to kill children,” Coleman said in one video Shortly after the video was made public, a senior member of the Taliban told Reuters that the timing of its release was meant to pressure Kabul not to carry out the death sentence given to Anas Haqqani, an imprisoned militant whose father founded the Haqqani network. Haqqani remains in a prison in Kabul, according to the Afghan ambassador to the US, Hamdullah Mohib. That means Haqqani could still be part of a potential future deal for Coleman, Boyle, and their children. The fourth and final video  —   the only one to show Coleman’s children  —   was posted to YouTube in late December. US and Afghan officials familiar with the case say that no new talks with the Taliban have started since the video was released, and that none seem likely in the near future. That shouldn’t necessarily come as a surprise. The US and its allies don’t negotiate with terrorists, except for when they do On paper, every president since Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan has abided by a simple maxim: The US won’t negotiate with terrorists, and it won’t make any concessions to them. There’s a simple logic at play. If terrorists believe they can change US policy by grabbing Americans  —   or receive money, weapons, or prisoners in exchange  —   the groups will have financial incentives to kidnap more US citizens. That was precisely the rationale Reagan used when he reiterated the policy in 1985 after TWA Flight 847 was hijacked by Shiite terrorists who executed a US Navy diver and threatened to kill more hostages unless dozens of militants were freed from Israeli jails (the remaining hostages were eventually released unharmed).       “America will never make concessions to terrorists  —   to do so would only invite more terrorism  —   nor will we ask nor pressure any other government to do so,” Reagan said. “Once we head down that path there would be no end to it, no end to the suffering of innocent people, no end to the bloody ransom all civilized nations must pay. ” In practice, though, many American presidents have been perfectly willing to throw out that policy and cut unsavory deals if it meant bringing back missing Americans. In the Reagan years, for example, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North tried to win the release of US hostages in Lebanon by selling weapons to Iran, which was considered a terrorist state.  Reagan consistently denied knowing about what eventually became known as the   affair, but that doesn’t change the fact that members of an administration that had sworn never to talk to terrorists eventually did just that. In April 2002,   George W. Bush said, “No nation can negotiate with terrorists, for there is no way to make peace with those whose only goal is death. ”  At the same time, and with no public notice, his administration helped pay a $300, 000 ransom payment to Abu Sayyaf, an    terrorist group in the Philippines that was holding a pair of American missionaries. The money was raised privately, but the White House, FBI, and State Department knew about the negotiations with the kidnappers and helped arrange and deliver the funds. Britain and Canada, like the US, refuse to pay ransoms to kidnappers holding their citizens. The governments of some of America’s other closest allies, however, do routinely negotiate with terror groups and pay ransoms to win the release of captive citizens. A 2014 investigation by the New York Times found that   and its affiliates in places like Africa had taken in at least $125 million in revenues from kidnapping since 2008, including $66 million in 2013 alone:      These payments were made almost exclusively by European governments, which funneled the money through a network of proxies, sometimes masking it as development aid. ..  In its early years, Al Qaeda received most of its money from   donors, but counterterrorism officials now believe the group finances the bulk of its recruitment, training and arms purchases from ransoms paid to free Europeans. Put more bluntly, Europe has become an inadvertent underwriter of al Qaeda.  The Colemans and other families of US hostages missing in Afghanistan or the Middle East, by contrast, have been given conflicting government guidance about whether they could try to pay ransoms to get their relatives back. The mixed messaging reflected a sharp divide between the FBI and State Department on the one hand, and the Justice Department and many in the Obama White House on the other.  Caitlan Coleman’s kidnappers said they’d free her and her family for just $150, 000. The FBI didn’t try to seal the deal.  There is no law on the books banning families from paying ransoms to foreign kidnappers who have captured their loved ones, and many companies operating in dangerous parts of the world  —   especially from the oil and energy sectors  —   have long had insurance to cover the costs of hiring firms specializing in hostage recovery.  “This was something the US government was perfectly happy to leave to the private sector,” said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corporation who previously held a senior post at Kroll Associates, one of the largest and   of the hostage recovery firms. “It was something I was personally doing for years at Kroll, where we handled a kidnapping every two weeks. ”             The FBI itself sometimes worked directly with the families of missing Americans to strike deals with foreign kidnappers.  Take the case of the American missionaries held in the Philippines. As detailed by Shane Harris, then of Foreign Policy, the FBI helped arrange the $300, 000 ransom payment designed to win the release of Martin and Gracia Burnham, who had been kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf. A former US official told Harris that the FBI had worked to hide its role in the push to get the Burnhams back, and that Abu Sayyaf didn’t know of the US involvement.     The effort ultimately failed: The Burnham family paid the money, but Abu Sayyaf didn’t release the hostages. Martin Burnham was later killed during a Filipino military raid that freed his wife. The federal government’s de facto policy of looking the other way when families paid ransoms for the release of their missing loved ones began to markedly change after ISIS started kidnapping Americans in Syria in 2014, when the group burst onto the world stage by quickly conquering large swaths of Iraq and Syria and instituting a brutal form of Islamic law.  Senior Obama administration officials told me in interviews at the time that they believed ISIS would never hold   discussions and would use any ransom payments to fund new attacks at home or abroad. Giving money to Latin American insurgents waging uprisings in their own countries was one thing; giving money to a transnational terror group with ambitions of hitting the West was something entirely different. The White House was even willing to use the threat of criminal prosecution to keep families from trying to talk to ISIS about the captive Americans. On at least three occasions, Col. Mark Mitchell, a counterterror specialist on the staff of the White House’s National Security Council, explicitly told the families that paying a ransom could lead to them facing charges under federal   financing laws.  Diane Foley, the mother of captive journalist James Foley, said that she felt confident Mitchell was misstating the law, but felt intimidated all the same because he was speaking for the White House. She told me in an interview that she was also struck by the fact that “he didn’t sound sympathetic” and was instead talking in a flat monotone.  “A family had never been prosecuted for trying to raise a ransom for a loved one, so that was just him misspeaking,” she told me in an interview. “He was trying to intimidate us, and it was appalling. ”     The Foleys weren’t the only ones angered by Mitchell’s comments. A senior US official told me earlier this year that the Justice Department had never prosecuted a family for paying a ransom to the captors holding their relatives, and wouldn’t have if any of the families had been able to strike a deal with ISIS. “I was dumbfounded that he’d basically threaten them,” the official told me.   In the end, no ransoms were ever paid to ISIS, and the senior US official told me that the families had never held any serious negotiations with the group. ISIS would later release grisly videos showing its beheadings of two more American citizens, journalist Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. ISIS says that Kayla Mueller, another American held by the group, was killed in a Jordanian airstrike; the group sent her parents photographs of her corpse as proof of her death.         Caitlan Coleman’s parents have faced the same unrelenting pain and uncertainty as the Foleys, Sotloffs, and Muellers did before they get definitive word of the fate of their missing children.  But they have a reason for muted optimism about her eventual release that the other families weren’t fortunate enough to share: Coleman and her family are being held by a group in Afghanistan with a long history of ransoming back hostages rather than killing them.  ISIS kills its US hostages. The Taliban tries to cash in on them. The Taliban’s steady release of videos showing Coleman and her family provide a striking illustration of the core difference between the way the Taliban views its American hostages and the way ISIS sees them. To the Taliban and its allies in the Haqqani network, the captive Westerners are chits that can be traded for money or prisoners. To ISIS, the hostages are useful primarily as the unwilling centerpieces of the propaganda videos built around their eventual executions. Barnett Rubin, an Afghanistan expert who spent nearly five years advising Washington’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, told me that the Taliban and the Haqqani network are fighting to expel foreign troops from their country and to create an Islamic government there, but have no aspirations of carrying out attacks beyond the country’s borders or trying to conquer neighboring nations. They want to be part of the international system, not overturn it.     ISIS, by contrast, doesn’t believe in borders or recognize the validity of the modern nation state. Instead, Barnett says, they want to conquer as much territory as they can and subsume it into their   caliphate.  “ISIS uses hostages either to extract money or to demonstrate its terrifying character to intimidate the West into leaving ISIS alone to dominate the Islamic world,” he says. “The Taliban uses hostages to raise money and to seek recognition as a legitimate and effective partner in international affairs. ”  The Haqqani network, the Taliban affiliate that is holding the Colemans, kidnaps and keeps Western hostages for an even more prosaic reason: the hefty ransoms they can receive in exchange for their freedom. I’ve spent significant time in Afghanistan, and US military officials there repeatedly described the Haqqanis as skilled fighters who operated more like a criminal gang  —   several, separately, likened them to the Sopranos  —   than a terror network. The group got its start battling the Soviet Union, but grew steadily more radical in the runup to the   terror attacks. When US forces swept into Afghanistan, the Haqqani network morphed into Washington’s most effective battlefield adversary, using advanced weaponry from Pakistan to kill hundreds of US troops and maim thousands more.  To fund its operations, the group has set up what amounts to a vast criminal enterprise that includes both   extortion rackets targeting ordinary Afghans and Pakistanis and ongoing attempts to kidnap foreigners for money. It’s a lucrative way of raising money: When the Taliban snatched 19 South Korean missionaries in 2007, the group’s leaders said Seoul paid $20 million for their freedom. More recently, Taliban leaders told the Daily Beast in 2011 that France paid a ransom of tens of millions of dollars to buy the release of two French hostages.  The fact that the Taliban sees hostage taking as a moneymaking enterprise is why so many involved in the Coleman case believe she could be free by now. The talks US military negotiators held with a representative of the Haqqani network  —   confirmed by two people with direct knowledge of the matter  —   represent one of the biggest missed opportunities.    The Haqqani representative told the military personnel that they’d be willing to free the hostages in exchange for a ransom of $150, 000, a relatively paltry sum for cases involving missing Americans. The US military personnel passed the representative’s contact information to the FBI, but the agency never pursued what appears to have been the most promising avenue to date for bringing the Coleman family home, according to the two sources. The FBI declined to comment. Unlike ISIS, the group has also shown a willingness to keep hostages alive for years while negotiating over the terms of their release. Bergdahl says he was tortured brutally during his years in captivity after trying to escape, but some other hostages have said their captors provided them with food, water, and medical attention. In a video plea to the Taliban in June 2016, Coleman’s parents thanked the group for “extending its hospitality to and providing Caity and her family with care. ” Put another way, hostages held by the Taliban and its Haqqani affiliates  —   like Bergdahl  —   have a good chance of returning home; those held by ISIS don’t. “This family should have come home years ago,” says a former official involved in the Coleman case   The Bergdahl trade was enormously controversial, with an internal government watchdog later concluding that the Obama administration broke the law by releasing the Taliban prisoners without giving Congress proper notice. The Colemans and the families of those held by ISIS were outraged that the Obama administration, after saying for years that it wouldn’t swap prisoners for the hostages, had done exactly that. “We were told that the US government will not exchange hostages  —   period,” Jim Coleman told Circa News in November. “But they did. ” Controversy aside, the former senior US military officer who was directly involved in those talks told me that he thinks the US was right to negotiate with the militants.     Instead, he has a blunter and far more devastating critique: Washington could have gotten a better deal, one that also included Coleman and the other missing Western hostages. “It should have been the five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl, Warren Weinstein, Caitlan Coleman, Josh Boyle, and their son,” the former officer said, noting that Coleman’s second son hadn’t been born at the time of the possible prisoner swap. “We could have gotten everybody out. Caitlan and her kids should be home by now. ”  The Pentagon thought it had a deal to free Coleman and her children. The State Department killed it. On June 11, 2015, a highly decorated member of the US Special Forces took a seat in a packed committee room on Capitol Hill and told the lawmakers that the military had been extremely close to an agreement to free the Colemans and the other Western hostages, only to see it all collapse because of bureaucratic infighting within the Obama administration. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine was so venerated within the military that the Army’s “Real Heroes” line had made a literal action figure showing him firing a machine gun. A Purple Heart winner, he had also received the Bronze Star for leading the elite team of US Special Operations Forces that protected Hamid Karzai in the immediate aftermath of the   attacks while the future Afghan president worked to cement his political standing within the country. In his testimony, Amerine said he led a highly secretive group of US troops working to bring back seven Western hostages held in Afghanistan and Pakistan, a group that included both Bergdahl and Caitlan Coleman. The US had been talking to the Taliban about a   “  ” swap of the five militants held at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl, but Amerine said there was a better option available. Under what he termed the “  ” deal, the US would have freed a captive Afghan drug lord named Haji Bashir Noorzai for the entire group of American and Canadian hostages.   Amerine told the lawmakers that his team was talking to the Noorzai tribe about the details of the deal and believed they could get the Taliban on board. Then, he said, Washington got involved.  “In the end when the Taliban came to the table, the State Department said it must be the ‘ ’” Amerine said.  Bergdahl was freed; the other hostages were not. Noorzai, a man sometimes called the Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan, is serving his sentence in a   prison in California. Coleman, Boyle, and their children remain in Taliban hands.  The State Department declined to comment. Almost half of the Americans kidnapped since 2001 have been murdered. That’s more than any other country. Two weeks after Amerine’s testimony on Capitol Hill, President Obama held a private meeting with the Foleys and other families of current and former hostages. He then took to the podium of the White House’s Roosevelt Room and conceded that Washington hadn’t been doing enough to bring their loved ones home. That, he said, was about to change. “These families have already suffered enough, and they should never feel ignored or victimized by their own government,” he said. “I acknowledged to them in private what I want to say publicly  —   that it is true that there have been times where our government, regardless of good intentions, has let them down. I promised them that we can do better. ” Obama then laid out what amounted to the   changes to American hostage policy in decades. The US government itself would still not pay ransoms, but Obama said that this administration would no longer threaten to prosecute families who paid money to hostage takers on their own. Obama also said the US would work to better coordinate its   efforts by creating a “fusion cell” within the FBI that would include officials from the State Department, Pentagon, and CIA. The move was meant to ensure that potential deals to free missing Americans didn’t fall between the cracks because of bureaucratic divisions and rivalries, as happened with the potential agreement to bring Coleman, Boyle, and their children back home. Families had also long complained they had no single point of contact within the government to reach out to for updates; Obama responded by creating the first presidential special envoy on hostage affairs, a new position housed within the State Department. “They really did pretty much everything we and the other families had been asking for,” Diane Foley said. “It was like they were trying to make amends. ” American hostages die in captivity far more often than those from other Western countries Still, it’s hard to gauge how well the new efforts are paying off. US officials say the fusion cell has helped recover 100 hostages, a quarter of whom were once held by terror groups. That may not be as heartening a statistic as it seems, however. The US won’t break down where those hostages had been held; given past history, it’s reasonable to assume that most came from Latin America or Africa, where criminal gangs have spent decades kidnapping Americans but quickly ransoming them back through intermediaries like Kroll Associates. Even with the changes, meanwhile, American hostages die in captivity far more often than those from other Western countries. In   a New America Foundation report found that 41 of the 90 hostages murdered by their kidnappers between 2001 and 2016 were Americans. (British captives made up the next biggest group, with 14 citizens killed by their captors.) In one particularly jarring statistic, 14 of the 15 Americans taken hostage by ISIS or its close allies were murdered or died in captivity. Of the 16 continental European hostages held by the group, by contrast, 14 were released.         “American hostages have suffered disproportionately bad outcomes compared to other Western hostages,” it found. The report attributed the disparity, in large part, to Washington’s “strict adherence” to its policy of not making any concessions to groups holding Americans captive. It found that one of the key justifications for that approach    that paying ransoms would encourage groups to nab more Americans    doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.  “Citizens of countries that make concessions such as ransom payments do not appear to be kidnapped at disproportionately high rates,” the report found. There’s also the open question of whether Trump supports the Obama administration’s   policies and will keep them in place. The fusion cell will survive automatically unless the new president actively dismantles it, but Trump would need to appoint a new special envoy for hostage affairs and, more broadly, decide whether to continue subtly encouraging families to try to strike deals with ISIS and other hostage takers on their own. Then again, the new president  —   a man who prides himself on dealmaking and will be looking for some early PR wins  —   could also decide to plunge headlong into the case and pressure the Afghan and Pakistani governments to free whichever prisoners or make whatever other compromises necessary to bring the family back home. Trump could find a willing partner in the Taliban, who closely follow US politics and might decide that the early days of a new and unproven administration offer their best opportunity in years to maximize what they would get in exchange for Coleman, Boyle, and their children. For her part, Diane Foley told me she’s requested a meeting with Trump or members of his transition team, but hasn’t heard back.  Caitlan Coleman’s parents dream of one day holding their grandchildren. It’s not clear if they’ll get the chance. Jim and Lynda Coleman live in a modest farmhouse in the small town of Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, population 2, 130. They broke years of near silence in June 2016 with a videotaped message to the Taliban thanking the militants for keeping their daughter and grandchildren alive and begging for their safe return. “We desperately want to be with and hold our daughter and grandsons,” James Coleman said in the video, timed to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ”As a man, father, and now grandfather, I am asking you to show mercy and release my daughter, her husband, and their beautiful children.” One month later, the couple spoke to the online news service Circa News about the case and shared a letter they’d received from their daughter that detailed the birth of her second child and begged them not to forget her. ”I pray to hear from you again, to hear how everybody is doing,” she wrote in a letter dated November 2, 2015, that was also addressed to her sister, Claire. ”Give my love to each member of the family, and share this letter with everyone. Claire, as silly as it sounds, I wish you were here with me. Mom, I’d love to hear about all your cooking in delicious detail.”             There has been no public response from the Taliban, who have never been in direct contact with the Coleman family. More than a month after the release of the most recent video, it’s not clear if Coleman and her children are any closer to being freed. Jim Coleman told me that it was unsettling and jarring to see his grandchildren for the first time on a video released by his family’s captors, but was heartened by the fact that his daughter,    and grandchildren all looked relatively healthy. ”I thought they looked like a couple of normal, healthy little American boys whose faces were dirty because they were messing around like little boys do,” he told me. The former senior military official has also remained optimistic. He said the Taliban are probably growing weary of having to bear the costs of feeding, housing, and providing medical care to Coleman, Boyle, and their children into the indefinite future. He also believes the militants are so highly attuned to public opinion inside and outside of Afghanistan that they’re acutely aware of how much their image would suffer if either Coleman or her children were to be hurt or killed while in their custody.  The likeliest scenario, he said, is that one of the family gets sick enough that the Taliban announces they’re being released on humanitarian grounds. Alternatively, a group that has for years shown a willingness to deal might finally agree to either a ransom the family could afford to pay or the type of modest political concessions  —   like the freeing of   Taliban prisoners  —   that the US or Afghan governments would be willing to make. “This is criminal for them, not political, so they have every incentive to keep the family alive and safe,” he said. “There should be a way to strike a deal, but think of all of the time that’s been wasted. That’s the part that eats at me: It didn’t need to drag on this long. This family should have come home years ago. ”        Editors: Jim Tankersley, Lauren WilliamsGraphics: Javier ZarracinaCopy editor: Tanya PaiVideo: Yochi Dreazen, Liz Scheltens Project manager and producer: Susannah Locke "
" Last July, a sharply dressed man named Frank Gaffney walked onto the stage of a crowded convention center in downtown Denver and proceeded to calmly warn his audience that Muslims were working to conquer America from the inside.    Speaking without notes at a glass lectern, Gaffney  —   who worked, decades ago, as a Pentagon official in the Reagan administration  —   told the audience that political leaders from both parties had spent years covering up the true threat to the US. It didn’t come from terrorists acting in the name of Islam. It came from Islam itself. Gaffney said that sharia, the Arabic term for Islamic law, was a “brutally repressive, totalitarian, political, military, and legal program” for gradually subverting Western governments and replacing them with ones that adhere to harsh Islamic dictates. And in the US, those efforts were already well underway.  “This program of subversive, stealthy penetration and takedown is operating. It’s, in fact, been at work for 50 years,” he said. “Our government has been subverted. ”    Gaffney wasn’t speaking metaphorically. He accused “agents of Hillary Clinton” of shredding files about Muslim radicals living both inside and outside the US and said that then —  Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was surrounded by “a small echo chamber which is filled by Muslim Brotherhood operatives. ”    The notion of senior US officials intentionally weakening American national security or appointing advisers who were literal members of a Middle Eastern Islamist movement is preposterous. But it’s important to take Gaffney seriously: He isn’t some   crank pumping out Islamophobic literature on the internet, and the event wasn’t a fringe gathering outside the political mainstream.  It was instead the 2016 Western Conservative Summit, a major meeting of thousands of Republican activists in Denver billed as “the largest gathering of conservatives outside of Washington, D. C. ” Other featured speakers included   presidential candidate Donald Trump, Sarah Palin, major conservative media figures like Hugh Hewitt and Erick Erickson, and two sitting US senators.    Gaffney is an important cog in a vast and growing ecosystem that exists just out of sight of most Americans  —   one that has spent years pushing the notion that there is a creeping, quiet plot to take over America from within. It is a plan that springs from Islamic scripture itself, and is supported by most mainstream Muslim organizations, most mosques, and, in all likelihood, your Muslim neighbor. The only way to be safe from the threat, according to Gaffney and other   ”” is to slash Muslim immigration, arrest key leaders of the Muslim American community, and shut down huge numbers of mosques. They have not gone so far as to propose outright ethnic cleansing; Gaffney, in his speech, says he has Muslim friends. Their dream, instead, is to destroy the Muslim American community without kicking out Muslims. The dire warnings are spread through an influential lobby, slick documentaries, and   books with titles like The Truth About Muhammad: Founder of the World’s Most Intolerant Religion. And now that fearful vision of Islam has found a home in the Trump White House.    Senior strategist Steve Bannon is a devotee of Gaffney’s ideas, as are National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. Trump’s political adviser, Kellyanne Conway, has done polling for Gaffney designed to illustrate the scale of the threat Muslims pose to America. And Trump himself has said things that sound like they could have been ripped from   literature. When the new president announced his ban on immigrants from seven   nations, it was widely seen as Trump moving to quickly carry out one of his most explicit  —   and most controversial  —   campaign promises. Yet it made no sense as a counterterrorism policy: No immigrant from one of the seven targeted countries has ever killed anyone in a terrorist attack on US soil. That’s because the real motivation was rooted in   logic. The movement’s thinkers have, for years, advocated a similar ban on Muslim immigration. They look to Europe and see Muslim immigrants creating a continent ridden with terrorism and nearly lost to Islamist subversion. The Muslim ban only makes sense when seen as part of their plan to prevent America from going down the same path  —   by keeping out as many Muslims as possible. The   influence in the Trump administration appears far from exhausted. They have long wanted to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, because they see major American Muslim organizations as Brotherhood fronts  —   and now that’s reportedly a major priority inside the Trump White House. Trump’s policies reflect an even scarier kind of prejudice than his own: one with a plan.  The theory: ISIS represents the soul of Islam             Gaffney is the president of the Center for Security Policy, or CSP, a   think tank located just blocks from the White House. In 2010, it convened a panel to study the Islamic threat to America. The group  —   which included former CIA Director R. James Woolsey and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency Edward Soyster  —   called itself “Team B II. ”     The original Team B was a working group put together in the ’70s as a kind of devil’s advocate in the Gerald Ford administration. Its goal was to provide a hawkish counterpoint to the softer detente policy toward the Soviet Union favored by the White House. Team B argued that communism was an insatiably aggressive doctrine, one that could not be appeased  —   a conclusion that would influencing Ronald Reagan’s foreign policy ideology. Team B II aimed to do something similar, but for radical Islamism and today’s Republican Party. They drew on the arguments of a loose intellectual movement that had coalesced on blogs in the years after   and had come to refer to itself as the “ . ”    believe that mainstream scholars of Islam, and counterterrorism experts in governments the world over, have fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the Islamist threat. Their basic mistake is that they overemphasize differences between Muslims, like the   split, and assume that ISIS and   are aberrant distortions of Islam. The truth,   believe, is more like the opposite. They argue that a correct reading of Islamic scripture shows that violence is intrinsic to Islam  —   that the religious doctrine itself, properly understood, commands Muslims to kill subjugate unbelievers. People who say otherwise  —   and CSP lumps both George W. Bush and Barack Obama into this category  —   are either willfully or unintentionally deceiving the American public.  In the years since its publication in 2010, the “Team B II” report  —   titled “Shariah: The Threat to America”  —   has become something of a   bible. It’s the clearest and most comprehensive summary of their ideas. To understand what they believe, and why they believe it, you have to understand this report. The great enemy in the report is something called “sharia. ” An Arabic word that literally translates as “law,” it’s the vast body of rules and regulations that guide daily life for believing Muslims  —   everything from not eating pork to who can lawfully be killed in a time of war to whether to charge interest on bank loans.     “Under Islamic law, lying is not only permissible, but obligatory” But because there is no single authority in Islam (like, say, the pope in the Catholic Church) there is no single, official,   interpretation of sharia. The thousands of rules and regulations that collectively make up the body of sharia have been deeply contested among Muslim scholars  —   and even individual Muslims  —   since the birth of Islam, with no agreement even on many vital issues. Team B II argues that sharia is different from similar moral codes in other religions, like the Jewish law that governs the rules for keeping kosher. They argue that sharia is fundamentally political; that its aim is to govern the lives of all people, and not just Muslims, by seizing control of the world’s governments. “There is ultimately but one sharia,” the report holds. “It is totalitarian in character, incompatible with our Constitution, and a threat to freedom here and around the world. Sharia’s adherents are making a determined, sustained, and   effort to impose it on all Muslims and   alike. ” To make this argument, Team B II’s authors rely heavily on something called “abrogation. ” This is a complex concept in Islamic legal theory, but it basically boils down to the idea that when trying to determine the “correct” answer to some legal question  —   say, whether it’s okay to drink alcohol, for instance  —   later verses in the Quran carry more weight than earlier ones. That is, the later verses abrogate, or override, the earlier ones. This stems from the fact that the Quran was revealed to the Prophet Mohammed not all at once, but rather over a period of 23 years. During that time, the circumstances in which Mohammed and the early Muslim community were living changed quite a bit. The earlier verses of the Quran came down while Mohammad was more of an itinerant preacher in Mecca, whereas the later verses came down during a time when Mohammed controlled the city of Medina and commanded a large Muslim army. The result is that the later verses tend to be more concerned with   administrative rules and military doctrine  —   including verses about conquering unbelievers  —   while the earlier verses are more focused on broader, more universal concepts of spirituality.     As a result of the doctrine of abrogation, Team B II claims, all Muslims are obligated to conquer the West and replace its governments with an Islamic theocracy called a caliphate. But one would be   to find a single credible Islamic scholar who interprets it this way.  For Islamic legal scholars, abrogation is but one tool used to interpret the Quran, and not an ultimate trump card. And the Quran, like the Bible, contains scriptures that both endorse and reject violence. In the full context of Islamic law, the injunctions to kill and conquer are often interpreted as being specific to that time and place in history, and do not necessarily overrule other, more peaceful verses in the Quran (e. g. “let there be no compulsion in religion”).  Team B II dismisses this as a form of tactical,   lying. There is an actual Arabic term for permissible lying in sharia, called taqiyya. It’s an obscure medieval ruling that basically permits Muslims to verbally blaspheme God or renounce their religion without incurring God’s wrath if they are under compulsion to do so.  So, for instance, if a Muslim were traveling in a land where being Muslim could get him killed and is captured by the authorities, he is allowed to say he isn’t Muslim  —   or even do things like praise pagan gods or slander the Prophet Mohammed  —   if his survival is on the line, without God getting mad. It’s a sort of      card. It’s also a concept generally associated with Shia Islam, as nearly all Sunni Islamic legal scholars reject the concept outright.  But the   have taken this medieval concept and turned it into a devious trick that Muslims are using to hide their true violent intentions.  They assert that the peaceful interpretations of Islam offered by Muslim authorities are a form of taqiyya designed to obscure the true nature of Islam from gullible Westerners. They point to things like the   hijackers going to strip clubs and drinking alcohol as examples of terrorists using taqiyya to blend in. And while the   hijackers certainly did those things, and may even have tried to justify their actions by saying they were just trying to blend in, they were all Sunni Muslims and therefore never would’ve used the concept of taqiyya to justify their actions.     “Under Islamic law, lying is not only permissible, but obligatory for Muslims in some situations,” Team B II writes in its report. “What Muslim audiences are required to know about Islam is not the same thing as what   Western audiences are allowed to know  —   or encouraged to think  —   by Islamic authorities. ” This quickly takes on the character of a conspiracy theory. Any attempt to cite an Islamic authority who takes a different view of the Quran is only proof, to the   that you are taken in by sharia propaganda. In that sense, arguing with the   is something of an impossible task. It’s a bit like attempting a    rebuttal of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. How a conspiracy theory goes from the fringes to the White House  When you ask credentialed experts on Islam and terrorism about   theories today, they usually don’t know whether to laugh or cry. “It’s hard to reply without sounding snooty,” Will McCants, the director of the Brookings Institution’s Project on US Relations with the Islamic World, tells me in response to a question about  . “[They] sell a lot of books and scare the hell out of Americans, but their policy recommendations range from vague to downright harmful. ” McCants is not wrong about the books. America Alone, a 2006 book alleging that ”a large majority of Western Muslims support the terrorists’ strategic goals,” cracked the top five of the New York Times’s   list. Several other   books, including The Politically Correct Guide to Islam and Because They Hate, made the   list around the same time. What few reviews of these books could be found in mainstream publications were not kind. Yale lecturer Daniel Luban wrote that they “can justly be called the new McCarthyism” in a review of the genre published in the Jewish magazine Tablet.    Regardless, the success of   literature spawned a whole mini industry  —   what author Nathan Lean termed “the Islamophobia Industry. ” In 2008, an organization called the Clarion Project distributed 28 million copies of a documentary titled Obsession, which alleged that more than 100 million Muslims were in thrall to “militant Islam. ” Another Clarion video, The Third Jihad: Radical Islam’s Vision for America, was blurbed by former New York City mayor and current White House cybersecurity adviser Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jon Kyl ( ). Clarion’s 2015 mini documentary By the Numbers, starring a Muslim woman named Raheel Raza who alleges a majority of her   want sharia to set national law, has more than 4 million views on YouTube. These works found a large audience, mostly among conservatives, largely as a result of America’s encounter with Islamic extremism over the course of the 2000s. The   attacks, interestingly, did not themselves spark an immediate turn against Muslims.  Part of this can be attributed to concerted efforts by the George W. Bush administration to discourage such sentiments. Indeed, just a little over a month after the   attacks took place, Bush issued a message to commemorate the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, stating, ”The Islam that we know is a faith devoted to the worship of one God, as revealed through The Holy Qur’an. It teaches the value and the importance of charity, mercy, and peace.” But as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on and more and more American service members died in those countries at the hands of Muslims, and as terrorist attacks in the name of Islam continued to take place around the world, many Americans started to blame Islam in general for the continuing bloodshed.    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   Under the Obama administration, this took on an overtly partisan flavor. When Bush defended Islam, few Republicans were interested in attacking him. Barack Hussein Obama got no such dispensation: Republicans attacked him as soft on ISIS and claimed he was more interested in protecting “the image of Islam” than in protecting America. Influential   pundits suggested he was an Islamist sympathizer or even a secret Muslim himself.     All of this, combined with Trump’s much more overt   rhetoric, has helped turn the Muslim religion into a partisan issue:    (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();     media, recognizing the appeal of the   message among their audience, has embraced this extreme   narrative the   are peddling. A study published by UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center found that guests with extreme   views made up 11 percent of all guests on prominent conservative talk radio during a period they studied in 2010. Two prominent   appeared on Fox News 15 times between September 2015 and February 2016, according to a count by Media Matters. Prominent televangelists spread the   gospel to yet another group of reliable conservatives. Pat Robertson, the host of the widely broadcast 700 Club, once said on air that “Islam is a political system that is bent on world domination. ” All of this is supplemented by a vast grassroots network, centering on a group called ACT for America. Billing itself as the “the NRA of National Security,” it claims to have a membership of 500, 000 nationwide, clustered in 1, 000 chapters around the country. Its president, Brigitte Gabriel, is the author of one of those     bestsellers (Because They Hate). A Lebanese Christian immigrant who calls herself “one of the leading terrorism experts in the world,” Gabriel has no formal background in terrorism, either through working in government or academia. According to her book, the highest level of education she received was a   course in business administration at a YWCA. Her claim to authority stems, allegedly, from experiences of persecution at the hands of Muslims during the Lebanese civil war in the 1980s  —   a historically dubious story that   journalist Michael Young once labeled a “con act. ” In a speech in May 2016 at the Oasis Church in Middletown, Ohio, Gabriel delivered an accessible and entertaining speech on the   view of Islam. In her telling, the history of Islam is a history of bloodshed. Between Islam’s founding in the seventh century and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in 1924, she says, “Islam was responsible for 270 million people across the globe  —   killed by the sword. ”  This violence was not accidental, Gabriel told the rapt crowd. It was the core of Islam itself.     Gabriel believes that for 12 years, Mohammed attempted to peacefully proselytize  —   and failed, miserably. Only when he turned to violence, to conversion at the point of the sword, did he begin to win success.  “Islam went from being strictly a spiritual movement, after 12 years, to becoming a political movement cloaked in religion,” she says. “Jihad is mentioned in the Quran 40 times  —   36 times out of 40 as a holy war against the infidels, to either kill them or subjugate them. ” These are all historically inaccurate claims. Haroon Moghul, a fellow at the New America Foundation, writes that they “play loose and fast with very different eras, places and peoples,” in order to put together a narrative of a uniformly aggressive Islam. Yet Gabriel’s group has been profoundly influential.   Her activists have worked tirelessly to pass legislation, based on a template constructed by Gaffney and CSP   counsel David Yerushalmi, that would ban state courts from considering sharia a valid source of law. By 2016, they had succeeded in nine states: Alabama, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, South Dakota, Arizona, and Tennessee.  “No court, administrative agency, or other governmental agency may enforce any provisions of any religious code,” the South Dakota version reads, neutral language obscuring the clear intent. More alarmingly, the ideas pushed by Gabriel and CSP have been embraced by the most important members of the Trump White House.    “Most people in the Middle East, or at least 50 percent, believe in being ” Bannon said on the Breitbart Daily News radio show in 2015. “ ” is an innocuous phrase commonly used by Muslims to denote that something is in line with Islamic law: For instance, you can find   home mortgage companies in the US that cater primarily (but not exclusively) to Muslims, because Islamic law forbids Muslims from collecting or paying interest on loans.  The Team B II report’s authors sees things like   financial institutions as an insidious threat to the US Constitution (they never really explain how a home mortgage company that doesn’t charge interest threatens the Constitution).  “These are people who believe only in jihad. They don’t want our system. ” But the Team B II report also frequently uses the term “ ” to describe not institutions or practices, but people: specifically, Muslims with dangerous,   beliefs,   beliefs. And this is exactly the way Bannon is using the term. “If you’re   or want to impose sharia law, the United States is the wrong place for you,” Bannon proclaimed.  It’s not just Bannon.  In his 2016 book The Field of Fight, Trump’s new national security adviser, Michael Flynn, wrote that Islamic scholars are attempting to trick the West to obscure the true nature of sharia. “These   Islamic scholars keep their message so complicated so as to create chaos, to confuse in order to control,” Flynn writes. “Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin, and Mussolini were more transparent. Sharia is a violent law that is buried in barbaric convictions. ” Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said more or less the same thing  —   in an official Senate press release. “Once again we face a totalitarian threat to the free world. This time it’s from ideological and apocalyptic Islam,” Sessions said.     “  sharia law,” Sessions argued, “fundamentally conflicts with our magnificent constitutional order that separates church and state, and that considers free debate and dissent the way to a better world. ” That these individuals all espouse the same weirdly specific interpretation of sharia is not a coincidence. Each one of them is deeply connected to the   world.  Bannon hosted   on his Breitbart radio show 41 times, according to a count by Mother Jones’s Josh Harkinson. Flynn is an adviser to the board of Gabriel’s ACT for America, and local ACT chapters organized many of the stops on the speaking tour for Flynn’s book. In 2015, Sessions received CSP’s Keeper of the Flame award, in honor of “his leadership on issues of great importance to the national security. ” And it goes even deeper than just Trump’s cabinet. Walid Phares, a fringe Lebanese Christian academic who served as Trump’s Middle East policy adviser during the campaign, once said, “It is absolutely constitutional and moral that citizens reject Sharia as a legal system that takes away their rights. ”  Sebastian and Katharine Gorka, a married couple who are staples of the   movement, have been given   positions on Trump’s staff: Sebastian is now his deputy assistant in the White House, and Katharine was on Trump’s Department of Homeland Security transition team. Trump himself, at times, has sounded a lot like a  .    “Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murder of   who won’t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to American  —   especially women,” Trump said, reading off a prepared statement during a December 2015 televised rally defending his proposal for a Muslim ban. “These are people who believe only in jihad. They don’t want our system. ” Several months prior to the rally, Trump had met with staffers at CSP for an   briefing. The subject was the threat from sharia.   see leading American Muslims as part of the problem             The fact that most Muslims are not killers is, for the   a most inconvenient fact. Over time,   have put less emphasis on the threat from overtly violent groups, like   and ISIS, and focused instead on a more insidious threat: the “stealth” or “civilization jihad. ”  The foremost theorist of civilization jihad is a writer named Robert Spencer. “He’s author of so many books, and one of the top two or three experts in the world on this great war we’re fighting against fundamental Islam,” Bannon said, when hosting Spencer on Breitbart Daily News on August 9, 2016. “Trump is listening to people like you,” he told Spencer later in the interview. Spencer, like Gabriel and Gaffney, has no formal training in Quranic scholarship. He received an MA in 1986 in religious studies from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and wrote his master’s thesis on Catholic history.  He’s run the blog Jihad Watch, a   tracker of Islamist activity, since 2003. He is also the author of 16 books, with titles like The Complete Infidels’ Guide to the Koran. Many of his books have been published by Regnery, the conservative publishing giant that also put out both Trump’s and Mitt Romney’s most recent books. Two of Spencer’s tomes made the New York Times   list; there’s a decent chance you’ve seen him on Fox News in the wake of a terrorist attack. In person, Spencer is short and portly, with a neatly trimmed black beard. He’s exceptionally confrontational, constantly trumpeting his willingness to debate all comers on Twitter and on Jihad Watch. When I contacted him for this story, his reply attacked the media  —   like most   he sees journalists as some of jihad’s most powerful enablers. “There you go again, Zack,” he wrote in response to one of my questions. “I know you’re a reporter, and a reporter for Vox, so I know where you stand. ” Spencer’s 2008 book, Stealth Jihad: How Radical Islam Is Subverting America Without Guns or Bombs, developed one of the most important ideas of the  . Its arguments were cited repeatedly and amplified in the Team B II report and also appear, in a simplified form, in speeches delivered by people like Gabriel in towns around the country. Spencer also regularly gives “counterterrorism” seminars based on these arguments to law enforcement agencies.  The central idea is that terrorists aren’t America’s real Muslim problem.  “Distracted by foreign wars and the prospect of domestic terror attacks, Americans pay little heed to the true agents of intolerance in their midst,” Spencer writes. “The stealth jihad advances largely unopposed because it is largely unrecognized. ” The “agents of intolerance” at the heart of this stealth jihad, Spencer explains, are the Muslim Brotherhood. It’s a group you’re probably at least passingly familiar with. Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Brotherhood is one of the oldest and most influential Islamist groups in history. The group’s goal has long been the toppling of the Egyptian government and its replacement with a Sunni theocracy.  Its tactics have varied over time, from promoting grassroots social change to fielding candidates for parliament, and some individuals and groups associated with the Brotherhood in the past have advocated violent revolution. The Brotherhood even managed to gain control over the Egyptian government briefly, when Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi won in the country’s first democratic election following the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.  Today, the group’s influence is relatively limited  —   Egypt’s military dictator, Abdel Fattah   overthrew Morsi in 2013 and since then has viciously suppressed Brotherhood activity. According to Human Rights Watch, he has killed more than 1, 000 individuals linked to the Brotherhood and arrested many, many more. In Spencer’s telling, though, the Brotherhood is not defined by its founding chapter in Egypt, or even its various open branches and offshoots (like the Palestinian militant group Hamas or the moderate Islamist Ennahda party in Tunisia). The hidden history of the 20th century, according to Spencer, is a history of the Brotherhood’s stealth penetration of the West. “Of course the MB still has the resources to act in the US and Europe,” Spencer tells me. “Its organizations here were   and handsomely funded before Sisi came along. ” In Stealth Jihad, Spencer rests this claim on a 1991 memo, written by a Muslim Brother named Mohamed Akram. The memo outlines a plan to establish a “global Islamic state,” starting in the United States. This begins, according to Akram, through a “shift from the collision mentality to the absorption mentality”  —   to move away from open conflict with Western authorities to suborning them from within. This might seem like a pathetically impossible task, given the minuscule number of Muslim Brothers in the US. But  —   and this is the absolutely critical part  —   Akram thinks the Brotherhood has powerful allies who might successfully and quietly mainstream its radical agenda. In the memo, he writes out “a list of our organizations and the organizations of our friends. ” “The majority of Islamic organizations in America are affiliates of or associated with the Muslim Brotherhood in some way”  It reads like a who’s who of Muslim civic organizations in the United States, including the Islamic Society of North America (the continent’s largest Muslim civic group) and the Muslim Students’ Association (the organization that represents Muslim students on virtually every college campus in the United States). This one memo, for Spencer and Gaffney, is solid proof that these organizations are Brotherhood fronts. “The Brotherhood, and its   allies and friends, [are] really working to forward the ‘grand jihad,’” Spencer writes. “When we scratch the ‘moderate’ surface of groups such as the Council on   Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) we find links to terrorist organizations and exhortations to Islamic supremacism. ” The Team B II report, two years later, put the point even more clearly. “The majority of Islamic organizations in America are affiliates of or associated with the Muslim Brotherhood in some way,” its authors explain. “Any organization that does not embrace sharia and the MB line has not been able to gain broad recognition as a   force. ” The evidentiary basis for this claim is extremely thin. For one thing, scholars of the Brotherhood have found no evidence that Akram’s memo was an accurate representation of the Brotherhood’s reach. “Nobody has ever produced any evidence that the document was more than something produced by the daydream of one enthusiast,” Nathan Brown, a George Washington University professor who studies the Brotherhood, told Religion Dispatches’ Sarah Posner in 2011. “Nothing in anything that I have heard has ever struck me as similar in tone or content to the ‘master plan. ’” Beyond that, the organizations themselves flatly deny being agents of the Muslim Brotherhood. Of course, as Spencer and his ilk would say, this could just be taqiyya. Except that the groups don’t just deny these affiliations  —   they openly advocate policies and interpretations of Islam that directly contradict this supposed grand Muslim Brotherhood plot against American values.  That does not stop Spencer, Team B II, and the rest of the   from citing Akram’s memo as gospel. Gaffney still tells audiences to download it (it’s available for free on CSP’s site). The idea that the Brotherhood dominates Muslim American life serves a critical bridging point in   ideology. It is the only possible explanation for why, despite sharia’s supposed mandate to violence and domination, Muslim Americans are not all that violent. It’s not that they don’t believe in “Islamic supremacism” (a favored   term); it’s that they’re more strategic about it than the dummies in   and ISIS. Militant groups can be bombed and killed. But stealth jihadists cannot: They wield Western commitments to free speech and political tolerance as a shield, allowing them to build up Muslim strength in the West without meaningful opposition.   latch onto any evidence of links between Muslim civic society and the Muslim Brotherhood to buttress this theory, wrenching quotes from Muslim leaders out of context and casting fringe figures as leading Muslim authorities. Take their strongest and most commonly cited piece of evidence: a 2007 Justice Department case against the Holy Land Foundation, a Muslim charity in the Dallas area that was diverting some of its donations to Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization. This is the most significant and largest case of a   operation using an American Muslim civic group as a front. The Akram memo was uncovered during the HLF investigation.  But in addition to the five leaders of the HLF who were actually convicted in the case, more than 246 individuals and Muslim groups, including ISNA and CAIR, were named as “unindicted  ” in the indictment  —   meaning the prosecutors believed they were linked to HLF’s scheme but couldn’t prove it. They couldn’t prove it because they had no real evidence for this claim. ISNA and CAIR later filed a suit alleging that the prosecutors had unjustifiably damaged their reputation by mentioning them in the indictment. Their evidence was that   were using it to smear them, and the court agreed. “There is no real dispute that CAIR suffered injury to its reputational interest by being listed as an unindicted   in this terrorism case. Press accounts and blog entries have reported, based on this case, that CAIR is a criminal organization that supports terrorism,” the presiding judge ruled. “The government has not argued or established any legitimate government interest that warrants publicly identifying CAIR and 245 other individuals and entities as unindicted  . ” “ISIS said they were going to send a jihad army into Europe via migration in 2015. Then two months later, the migration started. ” But, as with the Akram memo, the   have not stopped using the HLF case as proof that America’s largest Muslim organizations are part of a stealth jihad. Multiple Republican members of Congress have parroted these accusations, most notably when they accused Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Sen. Ted Cruz, a frequent speaker at CSP events, has repeatedly pushed legislation labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group  —   a key recommendation in both Spencer’s book and the Team B II report. Now a faction in the Trump administration, reportedly led by Flynn, is pushing to do the same thing by executive fiat  —   to add the Muslim Brotherhood to the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.  The State Department reportedly opposes this move as illegal. A new CIA memo, reported by Politico, warns that it would boost ISIS and   recruiting. Virtually every expert on the Muslim Brotherhood thinks it would be unworkable and unwise. Despite all this, the New York Times reports that the move has broad support in the White House. This should be no surprise: Both Attorney General Sessions and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, while in Congress,   Cruz’s bill.  “There are organizations and networks here in the United States tied to radical Islam in deep and fundamental ways,” Pompeo told Gaffney in a February 2015 interview on the latter’s radio program. “They’re not just in places like Libya and Syria and Iraq, but in places like Coldwater, Kansas, and small towns all throughout America. ” Bannon has long been warning of the threat from the Muslim Brotherhood and stealth jihad; in 2007, he wrote a documentary script proposal specifically calling CAIR and ISNA ”cultural jihadists” secretly working to build “an Islamic Republic in the United States. ” Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, in a 2016 interview with Bannon, warned of “an explanatory memorandum” uncovered in the Holy Land Foundation trial telling Muslims “to infiltrate, to multiply, to gain positions of power, and to commit what they call ‘civilization jihad. ’” Officially labeling the Brotherhood a terrorist group, an odd step given that the Brotherhood has not been linked to a terrorist attack in decades, takes on much darker tones when viewed through a   light. Remember,   think the majority of Muslim American groups in the United States are Brotherhood fronts. It’s illegal for any American to provide assistance to a designated foreign terrorist organization. This, then, could set the stage for a massive federal inquisition into America’s major Muslim organizations based on   conspiracy theories. The text of the    bill refers to CAIR and ISNA as “United   Brotherhood affiliates,” citing the Holy Land case. Gaffney told Bloomberg View’s Eli Lake that ”CAIR is one of the organizations [prosecutors] would have to look at” if the Brotherhood were designated a terrorist group. Spencer told me that the solution to the stealth jihad was to “enforce existing laws regarding sedition and subversion,” adding that “Muslim organizations in the West should be called upon to back up their   condemnations of   and ISIS with transparent, inspectable, honest programs teaching young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam offered by jihad terror groups. ” Investigations into, and perhaps prosecutions of, Muslim civic organizations. “Inspectable” programs ensuring that Muslim organizations toe a religious line that   find acceptable. That’s what the   really want from Trump. Europe will soon be “Eurabia”  —   a fate America might share In July of last year, I went to Cleveland to report on the Republican National Convention. It was a weird event by any metric, but the high point of strangeness had to be the evening I spent at a party for queer  . The event, organized by Breitbart’s gay firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, was called “Wake Up!”  —   as in, “wake up” to the threat of jihadism. Held in a dark ballroom adorned with pictures of mostly naked, extremely   men posing in red “Make America Great Again” hats, the party attracted a fairly infamous crowd.  I bumped into Pamela Geller, who   (alongside Spencer) a   group called Stop the Islamization of America, since renamed the American Freedom Defense Initiative, wearing a rainbow sequin shirt emblazoned with the slogan “Love Will Win. ” Geller is a regular on Fox News and conservative talk radio; she’s one of the most widely known   due to her assuming a leadership role in the fight against the “ground zero mosque” in 2010. She also has a tendency to embrace the most outlandish of conspiracy theories, once publishing a piece on her website suggesting that Barack Obama is the secret love child of Malcolm X.             When I ran into her, she was warning a partygoer of the imminent threat from Syrian refugees. “ISIS said they were going to send a jihad army into Europe via migration in 2015. Then two months later, the migration started,” Geller said. The implication  —   that the refugee crisis was an ISIS plot  —   wasn’t especially subtle. The ostensibly perilous state of Europe was something of a motif at the party. The featured speaker was Geert Wilders, the virulently   and   leader of the Netherlands’   Party for Freedom (PVV). Wilders, an extremely tall man with   Trumpesque hair, gave a fiery speech denouncing the influence of Islam in his homeland. “There is only one Islam, and that Islam has no place in a free society,” Wilders told the crowd. “We should   our societies. It’s a matter of our existence. ” One could not have hoped for a better summary of the   view of Europe. Proponents see the continent as a dark twin of America, a “there but for the grace of God” dystopia the Islamists are on the verge of conquering. The key culprit, in their minds, is immigration. Prior to World War II, the Muslim population in Europe was negligible. After the war, a need to rebuild the continent led Europe to bring in a lot of people from the nearby Middle East and North Africa as guest workers. Many of these guest workers stayed, and eventually brought over their families. These people formed Muslim communities, which continue to be a draw for new Muslim immigrants today, at the same time that birthrates among white Europeans were slowing down. The result was a rapidly growing Muslim minority in Western Europe. In 1950, 2 percent of Europeans were Muslim. That figure was 4 percent by 1990, and 6 percent by 2010. In 2005, a   woman named Gisèle Littman published a book warning of the dangers of this demographic shift, titled Eurabia: The   Axis. Littman, who publishes under the name Bat Ye’or (Hebrew for “daughter of the Nile”) dropped out of a master’s program at the University of Geneva in the 1960s. Nevertheless, she spent much of her life publishing “academic” tomes on Islam and Europe, arguing that the history of Islam is an unbroken history of theologically driven conquest. In Eurabia, Ye’or posited that Muslim immigration to Europe was not the benign economic migration it seemed. It was, instead, a dark plot  —   a plan, dating back to 1973, “superimposed on Europe by powerful governmental lobbies. ” The goal was to Islamize Europe, to reduce European whites to “dhimmitude”  —   a term she uses for   citizenship granted to   in an Islamic society. “Mohammed told his followers to migrate and spread Islam, in order to dominate all the lands of the world . .. and that’s exactly what they’re doing now” Eurabia has gotten scant mention in the American press; mainstream historians have scorned it. Yet the book’s thesis has risen to the level of dogma among American  ; Geller has called Ye’or “the world’s leading scholar and historian on Islamic expansionism in Europe, the Middle East and the West. ” In the pages of Jihad Watch and CSP publications, the notion that Muslim immigrants are imposing their rule on a hapless and clueless European majority is simply common sense. Every crime or terrorist attack committed by a Muslim, every law granting religious accommodations to Muslims, is cast as proof of the coming of Eurabia. At the 2015 Values Voter Summit, the big annual gathering for   evangelicals, Bannon sat down with ACT’s Gabriel to talk about the European refugee crisis. He referred to it as a Muslim “invasion,” and asked Gabriel if that was an overstatement. “It is not,” she replied. “Europe will no longer be Europe by 2050. Europe has already become Eurabia. Europe is Eurabia right now. ” For this reason, immigration occupies a central role in the   imagination. If Muslim immigration turned Europe into a   nightmare on the brink of sharia rule, then the first priority in the United States needs to be making sure the same thing can’t happen here. The Muslim Brotherhood is most easily defeated when you deny it foot soldiers. One of the key recommendations of CSP’s Team B II report is that “immigration of those who adhere to sharia must be precluded. ” More recently, CSP and ACT for America have been out front in opposing the resettlement of Syrian refugees. CSP has teamed up with longtime   activist Ann Corcoran, who got her start in 2006 opposing the resettlement of African refugees in her area of rural Maryland. A CSP video starring her has racked up nearly 3 million views on YouTube.  “This process of Muslim colonization is called the hijra,” Corcoran says in the video, using the Arabic word for migration. “Mohammed told his followers to migrate and spread Islam, in order to dominate all the lands of the world . .. and that’s exactly what they’re doing now. ” The “Muslim ban” and the               When Trump initially announced his plan for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” way back in December 2015, his campaign statement cited a poll conducted by CSP as the key piece of justification. “A poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing ‘25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad,’” the statement read. “51% of those polled, ‘agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to sharia. ’” This poll was, unsurprisingly, shot full of methodological problems. It was an online   poll, meaning that it was not a random sample of American Muslims, and several questions were written in such a way that the answers would end up sounding extremist no matter what. More interestingly, though, is the person who conducted the poll on CSP’s behalf. It was none other than Kellyanne Conway, who would go on to become Trump’s campaign manager and chief press surrogate. According to Mother Jones’s Pema Levy, who first reported the link, Conway’s firm had a relationship with CSP that dated back to 1998. ”It’s very alarming to me that such a high number of individuals, Muslims living in the US, would say, ’Well, we can have a choice’ [to follow sharia],” Conway said during a June 2015 appearance on a CSP podcast. “The Muslims living in the US themselves  —   27 percent of them, anyway  —   say that this is what the purpose of jihad is, to either punish nonbelievers (16 percent) or, the other 11 percent, to undermine   states.” This is the way in which the “Muslim ban” makes sense. Not as something Trump dreamed up by accident, but as a direct product of the  ’s influence on the president of the United States. You can even see the   influence in the text of the executive order itself. “In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles,” the order reads. “The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. ” When the Trump administration talked about the Muslim ban to press, they warned that unfettered Muslim entry into the country would bring about a constant drumbeat of   terrorism  —   a warning that sounded a lot like some  ’ descriptions of contemporary Europe. “We don’t want a situation where 20, 30 years from now, it’s just like a given thing that on a fairly regular basis that there’s domestic terror strikes, that stores are shut up or that airports have explosive devices planted or people are mowed down in the street by cars and automobiles and things of that nature,” an unnamed senior administration official told the Washington Post’s Jenna Johnson. “These are the realities that we’re living in today. ” How   want to change America  —   if Trump will let them            There is a   master plan. In 2015, CSP issued a   report to the Team B II report. Titled “The Secure Freedom Strategy,” and authored by “the Tiger Team,” it fleshed out a broad slate of specific policy actions that could be taken to act on Team B’s diagnosis of the problem. Something like Trump’s ban on refugees entering the country is in there, as is the    plan for listing the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Those aren’t the only two examples. The report spends a great deal of time lambasting the Obama administration for failing to openly name Islamism as our enemy. “The Obama administration’s increasingly institutionalized secularist  —   if not actively    —   policies have largely prevented the U. S. government from engaging in strategic information operations aimed at exposing and undermining the supremacist doctrine of shariah and the terrorism it commands,” its authors write. “Public clarity about that threat has also been compromised by the distortion of intelligence analysis and terminology used to describe Islam, jihad, and shariah. ” This has obvious resonances with the Republican attacks on Obama for failing to call terrorists “radical Islamists. ” But it also targets, specifically, President Obama’s “Countering Violent Extremism” initiative  —   a program that focuses on preventing Americans from being attracted to violent political movements, Islamist and   alike. This, the Tiger Team argues, is a way of downplaying the threat from the more dangerous stealth jihad. Now both Reuters and CNN have reported that the Trump team is planning to revamp the CVE program to focus solely on Islamism. Its new name? “Countering Islamic Extremism,” nomenclature that a) is focused exclusively on Islam, and b) deemphasizes the threat from violence specifically. News of the Trump team’s plans delighted   who have long attacked US government counterterrorism training for downplaying the threat from sharia. Spencer told me the revamp of the CVE program was the Trump initiative that he was most excited about. Spencer is being a bit premature  —   as of right now, the reports about the program still aren’t confirmed. But his glee points to something important, something missed in taking these things in isolation. The Trump team is incredibly disorganized: According to one New York Times account, Trump staffers still haven’t figured out how to turn on the lights in the White House Cabinet room. They also have an insurgent ideology, one that’s in many ways at odds with what you hear from mainstream Republicans  —   especially on foreign policy. There just isn’t a clear sense of what they want to do on a lot of issues, or what specific tools they could use to do it. The   by contrast, are extremely organized. They have a think tank that has put out detailed policy proposals, intellectuals with fairly large megaphones who can argue for the think tank’s ideas, and a large activist network that’s surprisingly   inside the Republican Party. And, of course, they have a lot of   sympathizers in the White House. So if the Trump team needs policy ideas on national security and terrorism, it’s entirely likely that they’d turn to CSP for help. Indeed, the explicit point of the Tiger Team’s Secure Freedom Strategy was to provide a comprehensive blueprint for a “war” on sharia to a White House that’s willing to listen. So what are their actual policy proposals? The report advocates reorienting training for counterterrorism staff around “the threat doctrine  —   sharia,” essentially meaning that the US should teach its spies and law enforcement officials that Islam is their enemy. It proposes “rolling up and shutting down [Muslim Brotherhood] front groups in the United States,” by which it means the main Muslim organizations in America. It suggests ending university programs that promote “  dialogue,” and replacing them with “corresponding educational activities exposing the true nature of sharia and the Muslim Brotherhood’s operations. ” Some recommendations are even more jarring. The report calls on the US government to use “sharia adherent advocacy and practices as legal premises for deportation and stripping of American citizenship”  —   in other words, kicking out Muslims who publicly announce that they live by Islamic moral codes. Former Speaker of the House and staunch Trump supporter Newt Gingrich has fervently embraced this idea, telling Sean Hannity in June 2016 that the US government should deport all Muslims who believe in sharia. The CSP report further states that “over eighty percent of U. S. mosques have been shown to be   and promoting jihad,” and that “they are incubators of, at best, subversion and, at worst, violence and should be treated accordingly. ” The clear implication is that the US government should shut down 80 percent of American mosques and arrest their imams on charges of promoting terrorism. This isn’t just a blueprint for war on sharia  —   it’s a blueprint for war on the Muslim American community. For using the power of the state to shut down Muslim organizations, arrest believing Muslims, and close the vast majority of mosques.  Prominent politicians have endorsed this plan (though it’s not clear if they’ve read it all the way through). At a 2015 CSP conference, the entirety of which is uploaded to YouTube, both Gingrich and Cruz labeled the Secure Freedom plan a sound strategy for fighting jihadism  —   a move that garnered very little attention at the time. The document is too obscure, and too boring, for most people to root through it. But these ideas in it cannot be seen as obscure anymore. “I definitely see individuals with this [ ] network having a huge influence within this administration,” Yasmine Taeb, a lobbyist at the Friends Committee on National Legislation who focuses on terrorism and civil liberties, tells me. “[Trump’s] policies are ones that they’ve been advocating for . .. which is scary. ” According to McCants, the Brookings scholar on Islam, “national security professionals on both sides of the aisle are freaking out” about the influence of   on Trump. Would Trump be able to implement all of the policies in the Secure Freedom Strategy by executive fiat? Almost certainly not. More to the point, it’s not clear that he’d want to: Shutting down 80 percent of America’s mosques is extreme even for him, well beyond anything he’s said publicly. The point, rather, is that this is where the people who are advising the president are coming from. Their repeated public statements, and the administration’s policy alignment with some key   priorities, cannot be ignored. These ideas, ideas which when taken to their logical conclusion end in a mass campaign of persecution targeting Muslim Americans, are now the dominant approach to terrorism among the president’s closest advisers. Watching the video of Gaffney’s speech at the Western Conservative Summit no longer feels like watching the ramblings of a coot. It feels like peering through a window into the way the Trump White House sees the world. "
" President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference Friday, delivering a freewheeling speech in a style familiar from his time on the campaign trail.     Trump touted his election victory, took a couple of swings at his former opponent Hillary Clinton, and defined the “mess” he inherited from President Barack Obama  —   and, of course, went on a winding tangent about his distaste for the media. Here are Trump’s remarks in full.   Great to be back at CPAC. It’s a place I have really  —   I love this place. I love you people. So thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters and so great when I watch them on television defending me; nobody has a chance. So I want to thank Matt and Mercedes. When Matt called and asked, I said absolutely I’ll be there with you.     The real reason I said it, I didn’t want him to go against me, so I said absolutely. And it really is an honor to be here. I wouldn’t miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends. And we’ll see you again next year and the year after that. And I’ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and I’ll make sure that we’re here a lot.     If you remember, my first major speech  —   sit down, everybody, come on.  You know, the dishonest media, they’ll say he didn’t get a standing ovation. You know why? No, you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they’ll say he never got a standing ovation, right?     They are the worst. So sit down. Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation. They leave out the part they never sat down. They leave that out. So I just want to thank you.  But you know, my first major speech was at CPAC, probably five or six years ago. First major political speech, and you were there. And it was  —   I loved it. I loved the people, I loved the commotion, and then they did these polls where I went through the roof and I wasn’t even running, right? But it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country, and I said let’s go to it. So it was very exciting.  I walked the stage on CPAC; I’ll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said I think I like this business.     I would have come last year, but I was worried that I’d be at that time too controversial. We wanted border security, we wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we’re going to get, and people consider that controversial, but you didn’t consider it controversial. So I’ve been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years we’ve been together, and now you finally have a president, finally. Took you a long time. Took you a long time. And it’s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me. You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make America great again.  The media didn’t think we would win. The pundits  —   you’re right  —   they had an idea. The pundits didn’t think we’d win. The consultants that suck up all that money  —   oh, they suck it up  —   they’re so good. They’re not good at politics, but they’re really good at sucking up people’s money. Especially my opponents’ because I kept them down to a minimum. But the consultants didn’t think we would win. But they all underestimated the power of the people, you, and the people proved them totally wrong. This is so true, and this is what’s been happening. Never underestimate the people. Never. I don’t think it will ever happen again.  And I want you all to know we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake. Phony. Fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. There are no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said give me a brea, k because I know the people. I know who they talked to. There were no nine people. But they say nine people. And somebody reads it and they say, oh, nine people, they have nine sources. They make up sources.  They’re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people  —   the fake news. They dropped off the word “fake”. And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word “fake” out. And now I’m saying, oh, no, this is no good. But that’s the way they are. So I’m not against the media, I’m not against the press. I don’t mind bad stories if I deserve them, and I tell you, I love good stories, but we won’t talk  —   I don’t get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news media or press. Fake. Fake. They have to leave that word.  I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being  —   let them say it to my face. Let there be no more sources. And remember this, and not in all cases. I mean, I had a story yesterday written about me in Reuters by a very honorable man that was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around, they are talented and honest as the day is long; that is great. But there are some terrible, dishonest people that do a tremendous disservice to our country, and to our people.  They are very dishonest people, and they shouldn’t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you’ve never seen before. You have no idea how bad it is because if you are not part of the story  —   and I put myself in your position sometimes because many of you, you’re not part of the story  —   and if you’re not part of the story, you know, then you sort of know if you are part of the story, you know what they’re saying is true or not.     So when they make it up and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election  —   polls, polls. They come out with some of these polls  —   and some of them got it right. I must say, Los Angeles Times, shocking, they did a great job. We had a couple of others that were right. Generally speaking, I can tell you the network. Somebody said, ”A poll came out.” I said what network is it?  And they’ll say a certain  —   let’s not even mention names, right? Shall we? Well, you have a lot of them. The Clinton News Network is one. Totally. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at their polls over the last two years. You’d think they’d fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered. I mean, who knows, maybe they’re just bad at polling. Or maybe they’re not legit. But it’s one or the other. Look at how inaccurate. Look at CBS, look at ABC also. Look at NBC.  Take a look at some of these polls. That were so bad, so inaccurate. And what that does is it creates a false narrative. It creates this narrative that it’s just like we’re not going to win. People say I love Trump but I’m not feeling great today. He can’t win, so I won’t go and vote. It creates a whole false deal, and we have to fight it, folks. We have to fight it. They’re very smart, they’re very cunning, and they’re very dishonest.  So just to conclude, it’s a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can’t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment. They always bring the the First Amendment. I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody  —   who uses it more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us  —   it gives it to me it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans  —   the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.  And many of these groups are part of large media corporations that have their own agenda. And it’s not your agenda and it’s not the country’s agenda, it’s their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly, but as you saw throughout the entire campaign and even now, the fake news doesn’t tell the truth. Doesn’t tell the truth. So just in finishing, I say it doesn’t represent the people, it never will represent the people, and we’re going to do something about it because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.  Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. And I’m here fighting for you, and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win was something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values. And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it’s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag. Yeah, there we should stand up. There we should stand up. And, by the way, we love our flag.     By the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed. There are lines that go back six blocks, and I tell you that because you won’t read about it, okay? But there are lines that go back six blocks. There is such love in this country for everything we stand for. You saw that on Election Day and you’re going to see it more and more. So we’re all part of this historic movement, a movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. There’s never been anything like this.  There’s been some movements, but there’s never been anything like this. There’s been some movements that petered out, like Bernie. Petered out. But it was a little rigged against him. Superdelegate, Superdelegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started. I actually said to my people, how does that happen?  Not that Bernie  —   but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump because you know why? He was right about trade. Our country is being absolutely devastated by trade deals, so we got a lot of support. So actually I like Bernie. I’m here to tell you what this means for the future of the Republican Party and the future of America. First, we need to define what this great, great, unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents.   The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that will put its own citizens first.  For too long we’ve traded away our jobs to other countries, so terrible. We’ve defended other nations’ borders while leaving ours wide open  —   anybody can come in. Oh, we’re going to build a wall, don’t worry about it. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. In fact, it’s going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule. Way ahead of schedule. Way, way, way ahead of schedule.     Gen. Kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job. Fantastic, the job he’s done. And remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. We’re getting the bad ones out. Okay? We’re getting the bad  —   if you watch these people, it’s like oh, gee, that’s so sad. We were getting bad people out of this country. People who shouldn’t be, whether it’s drugs or murder. We’re getting bad ones out. They’re the ones that go first. I said it from day one.  Basically all I’ve done is keep my promise. We’ve spent trillions overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East we’ve spent, as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it.  And, by the way, the Middle East is in what  —   I mean, it’s not even close  —  it’s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now. That I can tell you. Could have been a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.  This is the situation I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me.  We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. Now, I’ve been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn’t work, folks. I could say, I could talk. And now people are starting to develop a little  —   but the people that you’re watching, they’re not you. They’re largely, many of them are the side that lost. They lost the election. It’s like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election.  But I always say Obamacare doesn’t work, and these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare. And the bottom line, we’re changing it. We’re going to make it much better, we’re going to make it less expensive, we’re going to make it much better.    Obamacare covers very few people. And remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them. Was taken away from them. Millions of people were very happy with the health care. They had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie? 28 times. You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. Over and over and over again, you heard it. So we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we’re working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price  —   very talented guy  —   but I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely. It’s already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. It’s a disaster. But two years, don’t do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help. They’ll beg. And it’s their problem. But it’s not the right thing to do for the American people. It’s not the right thing to do.  We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years. Think of it, $20 trillion. It’s doubled. And we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We don’t win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Did we win anything? Do we win anything? Do we win anything? We’re going to win. We’re going to win big, folks. We’re going to start winning again. Believe me. But we’re taking a firm, bold, and decisive measure. We have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over. It’s over. Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that we’re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again.  We’ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and begin the construction of a great, great border wall. By doing this and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of Gen. Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this. Our border patrol, what they do  —   they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me  —   they never endorsed a presidential candidate before. They might not be allowed to, but they were disgusted what they saw.  We’ll stop it, we’ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. Pouring in. Pouring in. We get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems. They get the cash. No good. No good. Going to stop.     By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars. That’s so important because the dollars that we’re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities. We are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers, and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country. And we will not let them back in. They’re not coming back in, folks. They do, they’re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamed of.  I’m also working with the Department of Justice to begin reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what’s happening in Chicago, as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot. And I believe killed. Seven people. Seven people. Chicago. A great American city. Seven people shot and killed.  We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. Thank you and thank them.  I’ve also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn America from the   Partnership so that we can protect our economic freedom. And we’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to do     —       —   and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal, and then they come back and we’ll make a better deal. None of these big quagmire deals that are disaster. Just take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development. It’s economic undevelopment as far as our country is concerned.  We’re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare; we’re going to save Americans from this crisis and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve.     We have authorized the construction one day of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipeline and issued a new rule  —   this took place while I was getting ready to sign  —   I said who makes the pipes from the pipeline? Well, sir, comes from all over the world, isn’t that wonderful? I said, nope, comes from the United States or we’re not building it. American steel. If they want a pipeline in the United States, they’re going to use pipe that’s made in the United States. Do we agree?  But can you imagine  —   I told this story the other day. Can you imagine the gentleman, never met him, don’t even know the name of his country  —   I sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct.  Big, big company. They spend hundreds of millions on the pipeline. They got their approvals, everything in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn’t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. Before with the Keystone  —   so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, sucking the blood out of the company: Don’t worry, I used them all my life, okay? Don’t worry, I’m going to get it approved, I’m connected, I’m a lobbyist, don’t worry.  Bottom line, Obama didn’t sign it. Could be 42, 000 jobs, somewhere around there. Didn’t sign it. But can you imagine? He gave up. A year ago, it was dead. Now he’s doing nothing, calling his wife, hello, darling, I’m a little bored, you know that pipeline project, that has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. Mr. So and so. The Keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere has just been approved. Can you imagine the expression? You know the sad part?  The same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed, they’re now going to go back to him and say didn’t we do a great job? We want more money. That’s the way the system works  —   a little bit off  —   but that’s the way the system works.  We’re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas, and beautiful, clean coal, and we’re going to put our miners back to work. Miners are going back to work. Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they’re going back to work. We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy. Crushing.     And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can’t hire. We’re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. And, by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need, and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don’t need 75 percent of the repetitive regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don’t need. But we’re going to have regulation. It’s going to be really strong and really good, and we’re going to protect our environment and we’re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, okay.  Another major promise is tax reform. We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country. You see that.  In fact, I think I did more than any other president. They say  .   is meeting with Ford, he’s meeting with Chrysler, he’s meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time because Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now because of the election result making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they’re going back to Michigan and they’re going back to Ohio and they’re going back to Pennsylvania and they’re going back to North Carolina and to Florida.  It’s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work. You’re going to love it. You’re going to love it. You are going to love it.  We’re also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military. And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and hopefully we’ll never have to use it, but nobody’s going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history. No one will dare question, as they have been, because we’re very depleted, very, very depleted sequester. Nobody will question our military might again.  We believe in peace through strength, and that’s what we will have. As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS. Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the earth.     At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. And, by the way, take a look at what’s happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what’s happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. And then a day later I said, has anybody reported what’s going on? And it turned out that they didn’t  —   not too many of them did.  Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden. Great country, great people, I love Sweden. They understand I’m right. The people there understand I’m right. Take a look at what’s happening in Sweden. Take a look at what’s happened in Germany. Take a look at what’s happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris.  I have a friend, he’s a very, very substantial guy, he loves the city of lights. He loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer he would go to Paris. It was automatic. With his wife and his family. Hadn’t seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how’s Paris doing? Paris? I don’t go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris. That was four years, four, five years, hasn’t gone there. He wouldn’t miss it for anything. Now he doesn’t even think in terms of going there.  Take a look at what’s happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can’t let it happen to us. So let me state this as clearly as I can: We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America safe. You will see the action. I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people. I won’t do it. If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it’s okay, it doesn’t bother me.  The security of our people is number one, is number one. Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don’t have my Cabinet approved. Nobody mentions that. Do you know I still have people out there waiting to be approved. And everyone knows they’re going to be approved. It’s just a delay, delay, delay. It’s really sad. It’s really sad. And these are great people. These are some great people.     We still don’t have our Cabinet. I assume we’re setting records for that. That’s the only thing good about it, we’re setting records. I love setting records. But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.  I say Democrats, please, approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you know me. But we’re taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science and industry. Yesterday I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office. Caterpillar Tractor, Campbell Soup, we had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell Soup. We had everybody. And we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs. You know what? They’re going to be building them in this country and not in some other countries. We’re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and leaders from all around the world. They’re going to be building them in this country and not in some other countries.  We’re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and leaders from all around the world. Where the White House doors  —   they were closed, folks, you don’t realize that, they were closed  —   they’re now wide open, and they’re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. And when they come into the White House, we’re translating these meetings into action.  One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one. A lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag.  We will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. We’re taking care of our veterans. We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good. None of them. You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals? Where did they come from?  Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest with you. They’re not as stupid as you think. We will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. So true. And, by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.     You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA, and they didn’t have that on the list. It’s lucky I thought about it. But we will indeed. And they’re great people. And, by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country.  The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from? What’s going on here? These are   great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They’re not deplorable. Who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly? That’s the problem in politics. One wrong word and it’s over. She also said irredeemable, but we won’t mention that.  The GOP will be from now on the party also of the American worker. You know, we haven’t been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running, the primaries, millions and millions of people were joining. I won’t say it was because of me, but it was, okay? And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it, and it’s going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me.  A lot sooner than you think. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me. Global cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good. It’s very important, but there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I’m representing. I’m not representing the globe. I’m representing your country.  There’s one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America. It’s the allegiance to America. No matter our background or income or geography, we’re all citizens of this blessed land, and no matter our color or the blood, color of the blood we bleed, it’s the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember great patriots. We all salute with pride the same American flag, and we all are equal, totally equal in the eyes of almighty God. We’re equal.  Thank you. And I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the Christian community, communities of faith. Rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people but percentages of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks. It was amazing, an amazing outpouring and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach.  There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans, and the future belongs to us  —   the future belongs to all of you. And America is coming about, it’s, and it’s coming back and it’s roaring and you can hear it. It’s going to be bigger and better. It is going to be, it is going to be. Remember. And it’s roaring. It’s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. I want to thank you, and Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters I have all over the place, you are really great people. I want to thank you. And I want to say to you God bless you and God bless the United States of America.  Thank you, folks. Thank you. Thank you. "
" On January 6, President Barack Obama sat down with us for one of his final interviews before leaving the White House. The subject was the Affordable Care Act  —   the legislation that has come to carry his name and define his legacy.    It was strange circumstances Obama found himself in. He was leaving office an unusually popular president, with approval numbers nearing 60 percent. But his most important domestic achievement was imperiled. Republicans had spent years slamming Obamacare for high premiums, high deductibles, high copays, and daunting complexity. Donald Trump had won the White House in part by promising to repeal the ACA and replace it with “something terrific. ” Both houses of Congress would be controlled by Republicans who appeared set to carry out his plan. But over the course of the next 70 minutes, it became clear that Obama didn’t think they would get the job done. If he sounded unexpectedly confident, it’s because he believed the wicked problems of health reform  —   problems that bedeviled him and his administration for eight years  —   would turn on the GOP with equal force.             “Now is the time when Republicans have to go ahead and show their cards,” he said. “If in fact they have a program that would genuinely work better, and they want to call it whatever they want  —   they can call it Trumpcare or McConnellcare or Ryancare  —   if it actually works, I will be the first one to say, ‘Great; you should have told me that in 2009. I asked. ’”    Two months later, the release of House Republicans’ replacement plan  —   the American Health Care Act  —   has made Obama look prescient. The bill quickly placed Republicans under siege from both the left, which has found more to like in Obamacare as its survival has become threatened, and the right, which attacked the replacement as unrealistic and   and, most damning of all, as “Obamacare 2. 0. ”    The biggest problem Republicans face, though, isn’t from activists in either party. It’s from the tens of millions of Americans who now depend on Obamacare, and their friends, families,   and neighbors. They have been promised a replacement that costs less and covers more, and the GOP’s plan does neither. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the AHCA would throw 24 million people off health insurance over the next 10 years and leave the remnant in plans with higher deductibles, higher copays, and less coverage. The law would let insurers charge older Americans 500 percent more than younger Americans, and the sparer subsidies wouldn’t adjust to the local cost of insurance coverage, and thus would be insufficient in many areas. This is not the “something terrific” Trump promised, nor the kind of health care that polling shows Americans want.     We are reporters who have covered health care, and the legislative ideas that became the Affordable Care Act, since before Obama’s election. In the course of that reporting, including recent conversations with Obama and dozens of elected officials and staffers responsible for the Affordable Care Act’s design, passage, and implementation, we have unearthed several lessons from the law, which current and future health reformers should heed. At the moment, Republicans are ignoring most of them. Lesson 1: Everything in health care is a painful  . Own it.  Obama had a habit, back in meetings during the Affordable Care Act’s drafting, his former advisers recall. He would start twisting an invisible Rubik’s cube in the air, working his hands around to try to make the pieces fit together just right.     This was what health policy felt like: trying to slot together competing priorities in a way that was just as maddening as trying to get the color sides of a Rubik’s cube to line up. Any government health coverage expansion involves a series of   decisions that will inevitably anger one constituency or another. Provide robust health insurance plans, for example, and you need to spend more money  —   if you don’t, you must decide to cover fewer people. Provide skimpier coverage, and the price tag of a health insurance expansion goes down, but people get frustrated with their high deductibles and copays.  Change the system so one group pays less, and another group, inevitably, has to pay more.

It’s making the   that will lead to the best outcomes, and explaining those clearly to constituents. The Obama administration knew from the start that it wanted to make health insurance more accessible to those who had traditionally struggled to get covered: people who are sicker, older, and poorer  —   and did not have access to   coverage. Democrats didn’t just want to get millions covered. They had specific demographics in mind they wanted to benefit. “If you replace a    with a    that doesn’t change the number of people covered, but it changes the value of the coverage and of the program,” says Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who helped the White House model the economic effects of Obamacare.              Democrats had to make very clear   to advantage this older, sicker population.    For example, the law limits the premiums that insurers could charge their oldest consumers to just three times whatever they billed the youngest enrollees. The Affordable Care Act mandated that insurers must cover 10 “essential health benefit” categories. These included medical care that plans in the individual market have historically left out, such as mental health services and maternity care.  These changes were great for those who were older and required significant medical care. But bringing unhealthy people into the market is difficult, “because it requires the healthy people who had a sweet deal in the past to pay higher rates,” says former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “There is no question that some people’s rates went up, but the old market didn’t work very well for the majority of people who needed coverage. ” Democrats’   brought consequences, one of them being that the health care law has long struggled to attract as many young people as the White House would like. Back in 2012, administration officials told us they wanted   of the marketplace enrollees to be between 18 and 34. The number has never gotten there, hovering around   for the past four years. Zeke Emanuel, who worked as one of President Obama’s health care advisers, says the administration tilted the playing field too far in favor of the sick and elderly, making it difficult for young people to sign up. He says the administration should have let insurers charge older people more, perhaps four times as much as the youngest consumers. “We made the wrong ” he says. “The consequence is costs for old people are higher because we don’t have enough young people in the pool. ”    Veterans of the 2009 health care fight have dozens of stories about different   they had to make, ones that would anger different constituencies. The administration was constantly trying to balance the desire to expand coverage to as many people as possible against the commitment to keeping the package  . It faced outside pressure from hospitals and insurers, who some thought might turn their backs on the effort if it didn’t bring tens of millions of Americans into the health insurance system.              “Almost every aspect of the bill was inextricably linked,” says   DeParle, one of Obama’s top health care advisers. “Every time we tweaked the subsidies or the individual mandate penalties, CBO had to   the bill to see how it affected coverage. If CBO said that coverage decreased, that was a big problem, because the hospitals’ support for the bill was contingent on getting a high percentage of the uninsured covered. ”  Trump’s own ideas about health policy do not seem to grapple seriously with these  . He repeatedly talks about covering more people at a lower cost but has offered no plan to do so. The American Health Care Act, however, lays these issues bare. It makes different   than the ones that Democrats made. The bill would change the rules of the individual market to advantage people who are younger, healthier, and    —   but disadvantage people who are older, sicker, and poorer. AHCA, for example, would allow insurers to charge the oldest enrollees five times as much as the youngest enrollees. It would allow insurers to sell less robust health insurance plans that cover a smaller percentage of enrollees’ costs.  The results are particularly grim for older, poorer enrollees  —   many of whom vote Republican. According to the CBO’s analysis of the plan, a    making $26, 500 would see his premiums rise by 750 percent under the AHCA. But not only are Republicans refusing to own that    —   they’re refusing to own any  .     “Nobody will be worse off financially,” promised Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on a recent Meet the Press appearance. That’s a promise no plan could keep, but that Republicans have now made, in public, and that will be played back on ad after ad after ad.  Democrats learned, over months of hard work, that there was no free lunch in health policy. Republicans are now beginning to run into the same difficult truth: Every new winner in health care comes with a new loser.  Lesson 2: Bipartisanship  —   can’t live with it, nearly impossible to do reform without it The Affordable Care Act has come to symbolize intractable, unrelenting partisanship  —   and for good reason. The law passed without a single Republican vote. Since its passage, its approval rating has rarely dipped below 60 percent among Democrats and barely ever broken 20 percent among Republicans.  Republicans clearly don’t believe they will be any more successful at finding bipartisan support than Democrats. They are trying to pass the entirety of the American Health Care Act through the   budget reconciliation process  —   a strategy that means they won’t need a single Democratic vote in the Senate, but that also means they are limited to policy changes that are directly budgetary in nature, so they can’t rewrite insurance regulations and reform the delivery system in ways that may be necessary to make their plan work.              This is not the law the legacy Obama wanted. When he describes his law’s intellectual lineage, his frustration remains fresh.  “We said, ‘What’s a system out there that seems to be providing coverage for everybody that politically we could get through a Congress, which we can get Republican support? ’” he told us.     “And lo and behold, there had been a plan in Massachusetts that had been designed on a bipartisan basis, including by a Republican governor who ultimately became the nominee for the Republican Party, that came close to providing universal coverage. I would have thought  —   since this was an idea that had previously gotten a lot of Republican support  —   it would continue to get a lot of Republican support. And yet magically, the minute we said, ‘This is a great idea, and it’s working,’ the Republicans said, ‘This is terrible, and we don’t want to do this. ’” It is easy to overstate the symmetry between the Affordable Care Act and the reforms Mitt Romney signed in Massachusetts. The ACA raised more taxes, and imposed more regulations, than Romney’s plan. But it’s also true that Obama and the Democrats would have happily traded away many of those taxes and rules for even a couple of Republican votes. Nothing in the law frames the power of partisanship to erode bipartisanship more clearly than the individual mandate. The policy emerged in 1989 at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Senate Republicans made it a centerpiece of their alternative to the Clinton reforms. The   appeal held for decades. In May 2007, Sens. Ron Wyden and Bob Bennett released a health care plan that included an individual mandate, and it was   by 11 Republicans. In 2009  —   after Obama’s election  —   Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the crucial Senate Finance Committee, said “there is a bipartisan consensus to have individual mandates. ” The consensus didn’t last. In December 2009, every Senate Republican  —   including a number who still had their names on the   bill  —   voted to call the individual mandate “unconstitutional. ” The Affordable Care Act, like Obama’s presidency, was built to prove the premise that with the right ideas, and the right spirit of compromise, bipartisanship was still possible in American politics. Instead, like Obama’s presidency, it proved the opposite.  In the years since the law passed, there’s been much discussion of whether some other path, some other strategy, could have broken the logjam.     Phil Schiliro, the veteran House staffer who headed up Obama’s legislative strategy, has heard the objections and run the tape back again and again in his head. “The first thing we did was have the health care summit at the White House with Republicans and industry,” he says. “The president met repeatedly with congressional Republicans to find common ground. Congressional Democrats did the same. But it didn’t matter what the cost would be, how we designed the law, or how it would work. The answer was going to be no. And at every stage the answer was no. ”   It’s not Obama’s efforts that convince us of Schiliro’s point. It’s Max Baucus’s. The   chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Baucus was a moderate’s moderate  —   he had broken with his party to support both George W. Bush’s initial tax cuts and the Medicare prescription drug benefit, and he was more popular among centrist Republicans like Grassley than among liberals from his own party.  Baucus tried. He tried in the Finance Committee, and then when that didn’t work, he took Sens. Grassley, Olympia Snowe, Mike Enzi, Kent Conrad, and Jeff Bingaman into a back room and, for months, tried to forge a compromise among his “Gang of Six. ” But there was no compromise to be had. There wasn’t even a counteroffer to reject  —   the Senate’s moderate Republicans never laid out the price of their support. One reason there was no counteroffer? The GOP’s Senate leadership wanted to make sure there would be no agreement.  Mitch McConnell, the canny leader of the Senate Republicans, explained his strategy to the Atlantic. “We worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,” he said. “Because we thought  —   correctly, I think  —   that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the ‘bipartisan’ tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there’s a broad agreement that that’s the way forward. ”             McConnell is right about all this  —   he’s right that voters judge bipartisanship based on votes rather than ideas, and he’s right that keeping Republicans united against Obama’s major proposals was an effective strategy against a president who had promised a kinder, gentler political era. Imagine if 20 Senate Republicans had voted for the Affordable Care Act and praised Obama’s commitment to bipartisan ideas and governance. Imagine how powerful the campaign ads would have been, how high Obama’s approval ratings would have been  —   and imagine how much worse Republicans would have done in the 2010 election.  But McConnellism  —   which Democrats have now learned from and adopted  —   leaves the US political system in a fragile place. The Senate is a body that, at least under its current rules, typically requires compromise for anything to get done. But if the minority accurately diagnoses compromises as counter to their political interests, then nothing can get done.     “The question is, if the minority party absolutely doesn’t want to engage, does that mean the majority party just has to give up, even if a significant public good could be achieved?” asks Schiliro.  Now Republicans are reaping what they sowed. Having left Democrats to twist in 2009, they see little hope that Democrats will work with them in 2017. “Throughout the Obamacare debate there was always the hope of Republican support, and there were efforts, like the Gang of Six, to see whether that was possible,” says the Hoover Institute’s Lanhee Chen, who served as policy director to Mitt Romney. “We’re in a very different time now, and that does affect the process. There hasn’t been that level of outreach from Democrats. There’s no regular order possible here because Democrats don’t want to work with Republicans on this. ” This is why Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process, which hamstrings their plan from the start, rather than even trying to find eight Democrats to work with in the Senate. If budget reconciliation becomes the norm for health reform going forward  —   and we see no reason to believe it won’t be  —   it means the boundaries of possible policymaking will be sharply limited. The process basically makes reforming insurance markets impossible. “Reconciliation was designed for minor budgetary adjustments, not major policy proposals,” says Alan Frumin, the former Senate parliamentarian.  But the frustrations of this hyperpartisan reality will not be equally shared. Liberals who want to bring more of the health care system onto the federal budget will find that many of their goals can be achieved through budget reconciliation. Conservatives who want to make private insurance markets work better, and who want to build private alternatives to   insurers like Medicaid and Medicare, will find themselves persistently frustrated. Lesson 3: If you change the health care system, you own it When Democrats passed the ACA in 2010, they knew it wasn’t popular  —   poll after poll showed pluralities, if not majorities, opposed to the legislation, after the bruising national fight that led to its passage. But Democrats had a theory about the law: As time went on, and Americans started to gain coverage, its favorability would rise.    ”As that bill is enacted, it’s going to become more and more popular,” Sen. Chuck Schumer ( ) predicted on Meet the Press in March 2010. ”I think that [the law] over time is going to become more popular,” David Axelrod, then a senior adviser to President Obama, declared in September 2010. Seven years later, that theory has been proven dead wrong: Obamacare did not become more popular as tens of millions of Americans gained health insurance coverage. One of the most stunning charts about the health care law shows    approval ratings since 2014. The numbers barely budged  —   until this February, when, with repeal looming, support jumped, and a majority approved of the law for the first time.         Top Democrats were astonished to see how unified Republicans remained in their opposition to the health care law, even as millions gained coverage. Whenever some part of Obamacare went wrong  —   when premiums, for example, spiked 22 percent in 2016  —   Republicans trumpeted those failures. The White House learned, over the course of the past seven years, that they couldn’t expect a law passed on party lines to garner any praise from its legislative opponents. “The public never heard, from those who had originally been opposed, any concession that this was doing something good,” Obama says. “That affects public opinion. Generally speaking, when Obamacare has worked well, it wasn’t attributed to Obamacare. And when there were problems, they got   headlines. ” Polarization almost certainly played a role in keeping Obamacare unpopular, as Republican legislators shifted rightward and saw little political benefit in compromise. White House officials felt hamstrung by the fact that they passed Obamacare with no Republican votes, which made it easier for the party to pile on  —   they didn’t have to worry about putting a colleague who supported the law in an awkward spot.     But top Obama administration officials look back at their own work critically, faulting themselves for not being able to sell a health insurance program covering millions.  “There’s probably a communication strategy that could have worked better than what we did, because what we did didn’t work,” Schiliro says. One constant tension in the White House messaging strategy was over how to describe the change the new law would make to Americans’ lives. On the one hand, officials wanted to talk about the milestone accomplishment that would hugely change the lives of millions. On the other, they wanted to reassure millions of other anxious Americans that nothing would change at all. They learned that this was a difficult line to walk, one that often resulted in sweeping promises meant to reassure the public  —   promises the White House couldn’t actually keep.  Most famously, Obama told Americans that if they liked their doctors, they could keep them. That promise would be quoted dozens of times over, in stories about the marketplace plans’ narrow networks that put beloved family doctors out of reach.  “For the vast majority of Americans, that will be true,” Sebelius says today. “But insurers change networks constantly. It suddenly became a promise, and now we had people saying, ‘But I have a different network.’ It was an inelegant phrase. ”    Another problem: The Affordable Care Act did expand coverage to millions of Americans. But those millions of Americans made up a tiny sliver of the population. Obamacare’s   benefits  —   the end of annual limits in all   insurance, for example, or the end of cost sharing for preventive care  —   are harder to notice and don’t come with a sticker labeling them as part of the Affordable Care Act. “My theory was that as the benefits became more obvious, that people would come to appreciate it more,” David Axelrod, Obama’s former chief strategist, says. “The fundamental difficulty with health reform is that   …     you don’t really recognize those things unless you run into them. ” Americans didn’t seem to recognize what parts of Obamacare worked, but they could see exactly which parts of the health care system didn’t seem to function well. And one of the challenges the Obama administration constantly confronted  —   one that held back the law’s popularity  —   was that anything bad that happened in the health care system got blamed on Obamacare.              If premiums spiked? That was Obamacare, regardless of the fact that premiums historically go up every year. If a doctor stopped accepting certain patients, or an employer cut a hospital out of network? Also Obamacare. Andy Slavitt, who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services from 2014 to 2016, recalls a Roosevelt Room meeting where the president brought up this dynamic.  “The thing you’re going to have to come to grips with now is that we’ve given a name to the nebulous concerns that everybody has about their health care,” Slavitt recalls the president having said. “So if a doctor closes his office and moves a block down the road, that’s our fault. ”    That dynamic, Slavitt expects, now becomes an obstacle that Republicans have to confront too. The last party to reform the health care system owns the good and the bad. Somewhat ironically, the only thing that seems to have boosted Obamacare’s poll numbers is the threat of repeal. Recent polls have shown that more Americans than ever before approve of the health care law just at the moment that Republicans threaten to take it away. Robert Blendon, a health polling expert at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, says this reflects Americans thinking differently about the question. “Before, you might have people thinking, ‘I don’t like the mandate; I think it’s too expensive,’” Blendon says. “Those people who said ‘disapprove’ might not be in love with the bill, but I think now they’re thinking more seriously about what their answer means. ” Lesson 4: Benefits might not get popular, but they are very hard to take away “I don’t think there is any question if you could start all over again, with all Americans, you would do a   plan and probably have a constitutional right to health care,” Sebelius says. It’s a line you hear often from members of the Obama administration  —   Obama included. “If I was starting from scratch I would have supported a   system, because it’s easier for people to understand and manage,” he told us. But, he continued a bit ruefully, “we weren’t starting from scratch. ”  For reformers of all ideologies and all approaches, this is the hardest fact of health reform: We aren’t starting from scratch. Any system you build needs to be a compromise with the system we have  —   a system that provides insurance to more than nine in 10 Americans, a system that employers know how to navigate, a system the medical care industry has designed itself around. In 2008, one of us (Ezra) set out to   the failure of Bill Clinton’s 1994 health reforms. After interviewing dozens of participants and reading thousands of pages on the effort, the core mistake seemed clear: The Clinton administration had tried to change too much, too fast. Its bill would have taken the system we had and replaced it with something completely new. Americans are protective of their health insurance and mistrustful of the government.              Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist who wrote his dissertation on the Clinton administration’s failed effort, distills the problem well. ”When it comes to health care, it’s one thing to make the system better,” he says. “It’s a whole other to remake it entirely. You can ask Americans to walk forward, slowly, knowing they can scramble back to the ledge if need be. You cannot ask them to jump. ” Fifteen years later, the Obama administration launched its effort with the lessons of the Clinton reforms in mind. Its political lead, Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, had been around for the 1994 disaster and hadn’t forgotten a moment of it. The Obama White House resolved to do things differently this time.  Where the Clinton administration had built its bill in secret, the Obama administration would hand the process to Congress. And where the Clinton administration had tried to change as much as possible, the Obama administration would try to change as little as possible while still creating a universal, or nearly universal, health care system.  Thus the design of the ACA was incremental, even if its ambitions weren’t. Save for some spending cuts, it left Medicare coverage mostly alone. It left the massive   insurance market mostly alone. It expanded Medicaid coverage to more people. The big changes it made were to the messy individual insurance market, where the administration added protections for preexisting conditions, regulated marketplaces where insurers would compete for consumers, subsidies for   Americans, and the individual mandate to buy health coverage. But even here, the Obama administration tried to be careful  —   it allowed existing plans to “grandfather” into the new system. This was the backdrop of, “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. ” Even so, the Obama administration was changing at least part of the health care system. In 2013, about 4 million Americans saw their plans canceled because they were noncompliant with Obamacare’s regulations, and because they hadn’t followed the strict, complex regulations that governed the grandfathering process. The outcry was swift and severe. PolitiFact voted “If you like your health care plan, you can keep it” its lie of the year. Obama ultimately had to apologize for the chaos. “I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me,” he said.  The administration lost its fight with the health care status quo. Change proved scarier than stasis, and Obamacare’s popularity never recovered from the public’s fear of what they might lose, or did lose.  Now, though, Obamacare is the status quo. Tens of millions of Americans rely on it for health insurance they fear losing.  This is the reality Republicans are facing, and quickly coming to fear. Take the Medicaid expansion, which the House Freedom Caucus says must be repealed in any Obamacare alternative. Twenty of the 52 Republican senators come from states that have expanded Medicaid. Sixteen Republican governors lead states that have expanded Medicaid. The reality of what it would mean to take Medicaid coverage from that many people, and Medicaid dollars from that many hospitals, is quickly becoming clear to Republicans.             Rep. Phil Roe is a Tennessee Republican charged by the conservative Republican Study Committee with drafting the group’s Obamacare replacement. “What I thought was going to be easy was, I thought Medicaid, we’d just   it to the states,” he told us. “That one actually is going to be a little harder than I thought. The reason is there are states like New York, states that expanded [Medicaid]. How do you cover that 10 or so million people on Medicaid?” The new Republican plan struggles mightily with that reality. It keeps Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion until 2020  —   even allowing new states to sign up  —   and then freezes the expansion and cuts overall program spending thereafter. The result, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is that by 2026, 14 million fewer people would be on Medicaid than would be true under Obamacare. But it’s not just Medicaid: CBO projects the individual market will see 2 million fewer enrollees, and that employers will offer insurance to 7 million fewer people. But disruption to the status quo isn’t a binary question of insurance or no insurance. Beyond the coverage numbers, the leaner subsidies and new   regulations will mean many who have insurance they like and can afford now will have to switch over to insurance that costs them more, covers less, and leaves them furious with the Republican Party. Obamacare canceled 4 million plans, and the outcry was massive. The GOP’s bill is going to drive people out of tens of millions of plans, and the outcry is hard to even imagine.  Lesson 5: Partnering with the private sector, and private insurers, can be risky  —   in a way expanding   programs isn’t The Affordable Care Act included two coverage expansions: one through Medicaid, the    insurance program for   Americans, and another through new marketplaces, where   Americans could use federal tax credits to buy coverage. The marketplaces, the focus of more publicity and promotion, have consistently underperformed expectations. Republicans want to keep a form of this program, continuing to give Americans tax credits to purchase private plans. The Medicaid expansion, meanwhile, launched with little fanfare  —   and it has proved more successful than anyone thought.  “The Medicaid expansion works very well, but nobody likes to talk about it,” says Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. He recently ran focus groups of people on the marketplace. He was surprised to find that “many on the marketplaces would prefer to be on Medicaid. It was a pretty striking contrast. ” Three years ago, health economists believed Obamacare’s    marketplaces would grow to replace much of America’s fractured, complex   health insurance system.             Predictions for the   insurance system’s collapse ran rampant. The question around companies shifting workers to the new public marketplaces was often framed not as if but when. Zeke Emanuel pegged it at 2025. Jonathan Gruber estimated 2050. Republicans warned of widespread “employer dumping. ” You don’t hear those predictions anymore. Three major health insurers  —   Aetna, UnitedHealth, and Humana  —   have soured on the marketplaces, sharply reducing participation or pulling out entirely.   of counties had just one insurer selling coverage during the last open enrollment period.  Obamacare was meant to be the beginning of America’s transition to a new health care system  —   it was common in those days to hear the law spoken of as a ”platform” or ”a first step.” Instead, Obamacare is proving to be something much more familiar, and much more limited. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2014 that the marketplaces would have 23 million enrollees by now. Instead, they’re hovering around 10 million.  “We had expectations about how quickly people would transition to a different marketplace,” says former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. “We would have liked to have seen people do that faster. ” There are lots of explanations for why the marketplaces haven’t performed as well as expected. Health insurers gripe that the Obama administration’s regulations constantly changed and were impossible to succeed under. Certain policies meant to stabilize the market in nascent years didn’t work as planned. Politics may have played a role too. There is significant evidence that Aetna pulled out of the marketplaces, for example, in retaliation for the Obama administration denying its merger with Cigna.  Large employers, meanwhile, turned out to be much more hesitant to drop coverage than economists had expected. They had become accustomed to providing this as part of a benefit package and, after Healthcare. gov’s disastrous rollout, were not enthusiastic to send their workers into a brand new marketplace.  There is no evidence that Obamacare led to a decline in   coverage. One reason the marketplace has had lackluster enrollment is that big companies simply decided to keep buying their workers coverage. No matter which explanation you believe, the lesson here is clear: There are risks to working with private partners. If they decide not to participate in an insurance expansion, there isn’t much the government can do except beg and plead  —   which the Obama administration has had to do in a few cases, when some counties had no insurers at all.  Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, meanwhile, has been a quiet success. In 2015, CBO estimated that an average of 14 million people annually would gain coverage through that provision over the next decade. But in early 2016, the agency revised its numbers significantly upward, estimating that 18 million would enroll in coverage each year.  Medicaid was never legislators’ first choice when they thought about how to expand coverage. But because Medicaid pays doctors less than other programs, it was a cheaper way to cover millions of Americans. Democrats couldn’t afford a bill that expanded more expensive private insurance to everyone, so they included Medicaid as a significant source of coverage.             The program often gets maligned in Washington for not offering as much doctor choice as private insurance. But here’s the surprising thing about Medicaid: Even so, most enrollees are really happy with their coverage. They pay no premiums and face pretty small copays when they go to the doctor or fill prescriptions.  A recent survey from the Commonwealth Fund found that Medicaid enrollees are more likely to report being satisfied with their coverage than those on the marketplace.   percent of Medicaid enrollees said they were very satisfied with their plans, and 37 percent somewhat satisfied.  “It’s good insurance,” says Brandon Bolton, a    dishwasher in Corbin, Kentucky, with whom one of us (Sarah) spoke on a reporting trip last winter. “I was able to go to any doctor I wanted, I didn’t have to pay nothing  —   no medicine fees, no copays, nothing. ” Bolton never had insurance before Kentucky expanded Medicaid. He couldn’t afford to take his prescriptions for multiple mental health conditions, including ADHD and   disorder.  “I was actually able to go to the dentist, get my teeth cleaned and checked, get my cavities taken care of, and get the meds I need to help stabilize a bit,” he says.  Others in Kentucky who used the marketplace saw people like Bolton and got jealous  —   they wanted the plans without deductibles and lower premiums, which seemed like a better deal than what marketplace enrollees could afford on the exchange.  “They can go to the doctor for anything, but I wouldn’t even think about it with my deductible,” one marketplace enrollee, who asked that we not use their name, observed. Along with their Medicaid enrollment freeze, Republicans plan to make a second go at working with private plans to expand coverage through the individual market. They will continue to offer tax credits for those who purchase plans there. These tax credits are much smaller than those offered under Obamacare and, particularly in rural areas where coverage is expensive, will not go far toward buying a plan. The Republicans will see if they, unlike the Obama administration, can turn an industry accountable to shareholders into a willing partner.  Lesson 6: Affordability doesn’t mean what Washington thinks it means On March 5, 2009, Obama invited key legislators from both parties to a White House summit on health reform. McConnell was there, and so was Harry Reid. An ailing Ted Kennedy attended, as did Grassley, the ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Finance Committee.  These were the heady, early days of health reform, the days when bipartisanship seemed possible and agreement seemed near. And so Obama made his argument  —   an argument built to appeal to both sides of the aisle.  “Medicare costs are consuming our federal budget,” he said. “I don’t have to tell members of Congress this. Medicaid is overwhelming our state budgets. I don’t need to tell governors and state legislatures that. ” This was the argument the White House thought would win them the day. Republicans and Democrats didn’t agree on much, but both sides worried about the exploding federal budget deficit, and both sides knew skyrocketing health care costs were the core problem. Health reform, Obama promised, would “bend the cost curve”  —   it would slow the rise in health costs that was straining both government and corporate budgets.                          The White House thought they had found a unifying thread within health reform: Republicans and Democrats, businesses and state governments, people and providers  —   everyone was worried about costs. And so the Affordable Care Act was thick with policies meant to push people toward   plans and keep deficits under control.  The subsidies were designed to push people into cheaper plans on the insurance exchanges. Medicare was given a board empowered to make sweeping, unpopular reforms to keep costs down. The law included a tax on expensive,   insurance plans. Democrats made sure the whole thing was paid for by raising taxes on the rich and cutting more than $500 billion in Medicare spending.   The changes appear to have worked. Systemwide costs have been growing at their slowest rate in recorded history  —   an achievement that is not solely attributable to Obamacare, but has been helped along by it. The Congressional Budget Office now thinks the federal government will spend less on health care in the coming years, even with Obamacare, than it thought it would spend before Obamacare passed. Exchange insurers have pushed hard into plans with narrow networks and high deductibles.  This is how the cost curve bends. If you had described this reality to Obama administration officials on the day of the law’s passage, they would have celebrated. But people hate it.  The narrow networks and high deductibles are among Obamacare’s   features  —   a Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 70 percent of Obamacare enrollees with   plans judged their insurance only a “fair” or “poor” value, while that number fell to 37 percent among enrollees with   plans. The Medicare cuts and tax increases have been powerful issues for Republicans on the campaign trail. The tax on expensive,   insurance plans is so unpopular that both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton promised to kill it.  It is rare for a policy to work so well in practice and fail so totally in popular opinion. But Obamacare ran into the paradox of cost control: The policies that control costs are the policies people hate most. At the core of that paradox is confusion about what different groups mean when they talk about cost control.  When economists in Washington say they want to control health care costs, they mean something like this: People should buy less health care, or cheaper health care, so that total spending on health care falls. When voters say they want to control health care costs, they mean something like this: Someone else should pay for my health care so I can purchase what I need without much financial strain. “People wanted the cost curve bent for themselves, and Washington wanted the cost curve bent in overall health care spending,” says David Axelrod. “This was, believe me, a discussion within the administration. As a guy who is closer to the politics of it, I was excited about the notion of bending the cost curve for people. The   guys had a whole different concept. ” What’s crucial to understanding the public’s perspective here is that the bulk of health insurance costs in America are paid for by someone else. On average, employers pay about 70 percent of the cost of their employees’ health care. Medicare and Medicaid cover an even higher percentage than that. This is what good health insurance has come to mean in this country: generous coverage that’s paid for by someone else.  This drives economists crazy. They note that someone is always paying. With Medicare and Medicaid, it’s taxpayers. With   insurance, the money is coming out of wages. And because individuals don’t feel the full cost of their health care expenses, they spend more than they otherwise might, raising costs for everyone.              “We can’t get health care for free,” Obama told us when we asked him about the tension between controlling costs for individuals and controlling costs for the government. “You’re going to have to pay for it one way or another. Either the government will pay more, so people don’t have as many    costs  —   and that means, in some fashion, higher taxes for somebody  —   or individuals will have to pay more out of pocket, in one way or another. ” But given the options on the table, it’s worth asking if perhaps the government should have paid more. Democrats built Obamacare with a number of artificial strictures. One was that the law could only cost $1 trillion over 10 years  —   a number chosen arbitrarily to reduce sticker shock, though it clearly didn’t work. Another was that the law had to be paid for in its first 10 years.  Not everyone involved in its drafting thinks those constraints were worth the   of lower subsidies, higher premiums and deductibles, and assorted unpopular spending cuts and tax hikes. “What people mean by ‘affordability’ is that they want a low premium,” says Zeke Emanuel. “That’s been our Achilles’ heel. The big issue there is we just weren’t generous enough with the subsidies. We should have spent more. ” Perhaps the more fundamental issue is that both Democrats and Republicans are committed to controlling costs by making insurance harder to use and health care expenses more transparent for patients. That’s not how other countries with lower health care costs find their savings. “If you think about how much other countries spend, there’s basically no correlation between their spending and    costs,” says Hacker, the Yale political scientist who has done extensive work on health care politics. “What drives it is the strength of government bargaining power. But that’s not accepted even among liberal health policy experts in the US. ”  This is a lesson Republicans aren’t learning. The AHCA cuts both the size of the subsidies and the generosity of what counts as insurance. The result will be people paying more to receive less. Some plans, for some people, may sport lower premiums, but those lower premiums will come with   deductibles and copays, and the diminished tax credits will make the price tag hurt more for most. The CBO says the law cuts the deficit by more than $300 billion, but it does so by kicking 24 million people off health insurance. This won’t be popular, and Republicans know it. Over and over again, they have zeroed in on the high copays and deductibles in Obamacare as a key source of discontent. In a January interview with the Washington Post, Trump promised “insurance for everybody” with “much lower deductibles. ” That same month, McConnell complained that “Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance that they have to pay for, and the deductibles are so high that it’s really not worth much to them. ” Republicans were right that this was one of Obamacare’s core weaknesses. But they have never figured out how to bridge the distance between their opportunistic criticisms of the law and the basic fact that their plans lean harder into high deductibles, high copays, and letting people who can’t afford good insurance get by with bad insurance. Their plan makes the most unpopular parts of Obamacare worse, and they will own the results.  Lesson 7: Prices are the fundamental challenge in American health care  —   and reform will remain an exasperating exercise until that changes There is, of course, a way to make health care affordable to the government and its citizens: Regulate American medical prices.  Health care in the United States is expensive. Ridiculously, outlandishly expensive. We spend $2. 8 trillion on health care annually, more than any other country. The reason we spend so much money isn’t because we go to the doctor a lot. On average, Americans actually see the doctor slightly less than people in other developed countries. The reason American health care is expensive is because when we go to the doctor, it costs more than when someone in Canada or England or France or any other developed nation goes to the doctor.  Other developed countries use price controls in medicine. The government negotiates with drug companies and device makers and doctors to set lower prices. The government is buying in bulk, and has the power to win those negotiations. These countries regulate medical prices akin to how they regulate the price of electricity or water: a service that everyone needs at reasonable price, but would face significant difficulty bargaining for on their own.              The United States does set medical prices for the 50 million elderly Americans who rely on Medicare. The   insurer has a fee schedule that says exactly what doctors can bill for every visit or checkup  —   and usually ends up with lower prices as a result. But for the 155 million Americans who get coverage through their employers  —   and 22 million in the individual market  —   that task is left to the insurers and customers. We are not very good at it.  We recently spoke with Todd Anderson, a father in the Philadelphia area, who told me about a trip his son recently made to the emergency room after cutting his finger with a knife while doing dishes. His son is a college sophomore; his son’s roommate, a biology major, said that he’d recently used the knife to cut raw meat and drove him to the emergency room. The physician assistant at the emergency room examined the son’s finger and treated him with liquid stitches and a bandage. A few months later, Anderson received $2, 237 in two separate bills  —   one for $1, 032 from the hospital, another for $1, 438 from the doctor  —   for the   and its application. The doctor group charged the Andersons for two days in the emergency room, because the   visit began around 11 pm and ended around 1 am. “I feel like I’m being told to pay the hospital and the doctor for the exact same service, and no one has been able to explain to me why it can possibly cost this much,” Anderson says.  These types of bills just don’t happen in other countries, where the government negotiates with providers to set a reasonable fee for what a   delivered in an emergency room can cost.  “The issue of prices needs to be put on the table,” says Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “A lot of the effort right now is aimed at reducing volume of care, not price of care. But what people are more concerned about is their    costs. ” The Affordable Care Act did not aim to regulate health care prices in the United States. Instead, it emphasized reducing the volume of health care in the United States. It tried to get rid of the financial incentives of a “fee for service” system that pays doctors for every test or procedure, regardless of whether it’s actually necessary. Obamacare had dozens of experiments that aimed to move the health care system to a “  ” system, where doctors would be rewarded for making patients healthier  —   not just providing medical services. Some of these experiments have been successful. Unnecessary readmissions to hospitals, which the health care law began penalizing in 2013, have plummeted. There is some evidence that these programs have led to slower health care cost growth too. None of these changes put the United States on the path to having health care costs more in the neighborhood of Canada or France or other developed nations. That’s just really hard when an MRI costs, on average, $1, 119 here  —   but $503 in Switzerland or $215 in Australia.              The United States pays health care workers much more too. Nine of the 10   jobs in the United States are different medical specialties. American orthopedic surgeons earn an average of $442, 000  —   three times as much as what their counterparts in France earn.   Regulating health care prices was never a serious part of the Affordable Care Act debate. The Obama administration made a conscientious decision, at the start of its health care effort, to get all major industry groups to stand behind the law  —   or at least not work against it. Regulating health care prices would have meant that hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies would all earn less. The idea was a nonstarter. But America’s high health care prices are at the core of what Obamacare enrollees dislike about the program. High prices mean high premiums and big bills when customers remain in their deductibles, the two parts of the law that get the lowest favorability ratings from those who rely on the marketplaces for coverage. Trump has shown some interest in regulating health care prices, particularly in allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Any serious effort to constrain health care prices would likely need to go far beyond pharmaceuticals, which make up 10 percent of American drug spending annually. To prevent $2, 237 bills for   you’ve have to tackle the rest of the health care system  —   and that is not something either political party has proposed.  “It’s the cost issue that will continue to drive us crazy,” says Bill Hoagland, a vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center who previously worked as budget director for Sen. Bill Frist ( ). “I don’t know how Republicans put together a package that reduces the deficit that doesn’t focus on price. Doctor costs, hospital costs  —   that’s where we have to focus our attention. ” They aren’t yet  —   at least not in their replacement bill.  The test: What comes after Obamacare? In September 2009, President Obama called a joint session of Congress to sell his health reform bill. “I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last,” he said.  He will not be the last. But those who come after Obama would be wise to heed the lessons of his health reform effort. For Democrats, those lessons are relatively straightforward. It is easy to imagine the next Democratic president passing a health care bill that does four things: expand Medicaid coverage up to 200 percent of poverty, boost subsidies in the exchanges, add a public option that can use Medicare or Medicaid’s pricing power, and let people above age 50 buy into Medicare.  A bill like that could pass the Senate with 51 votes, it would build on what has worked both in America and elsewhere, and it would be straightforward for the government to administer and voters to understand.              Obama’s successor, however, isn’t a Democrat. Trump has often hinted at expansive instincts on health care, praising Canada’s   system, promising he wouldn’t cut Medicaid or Medicare, worrying that the government is getting ripped off by hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, and telling 60 Minutes that “everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now” and “the government’s gonna pay for it. ” The plan he has lashed himself to cheerfully breaks those promises, and it is unclear whether Trump realizes it. The AHCA replaces Obamacare while learning nothing from its difficulties. It covers fewer people with less generous insurance, relies on complex arrangements with private insurers, does nothing to address the high prices that drive the cost of US health care, and is being rushed through a hyperpartisan process that ensures Democrats will unwind it as soon as they have the power to do so. These problems reflect a larger issue the Republican Party must resolve. The Democratic Party’s basic health reform goal is to tax richer people to provide generous insurance to poorer people. This is a broadly popular aim, and many of Obamacare’s problems come because Democrats didn’t lean into it hard enough. The Republican Party’s goals are more diverse, and often less popular.  Fundamentally, Republicans are suspicious of high levels of redistribution in the health care system and frustrated by generous plans funded by   payers. GOP proposals tend to envision a health care system based around catastrophic plans and health savings accounts, where people are protected from financial calamity, but otherwise are pushed to shop cautiously for care, and must make do when they simply can’t afford it at all. Republicans want a market where consumers push the cost of health care down, and one reason they push the costs down is because they often can’t afford the pricier options.  There are reasonable arguments for the conservative health care vision, but Republicans don’t make them. Instead, they have attacked Obamacare for being insufficiently generous, for covering too few people, for canceling plans people relied on, for failing to solve the problem of affordability in health care.  While all these criticisms are correct, the Republican replacement plan will make them worse. If it passes, voters are going to find that out, and the reckoning will be severe.              This, above all, is the lesson Republicans need to learn from Obamacare: Don’t overpromise, and don’t mislead.  To the extent that Republicans have a different vision of health care than the Democrats or even the voters, they need to be making that case, and building consensus around a health care system that offers less so it can cost less and tax less. Building that system while promising the opposite will result in disaster, both for them and for the voters who rely on them. "
" Back in November 2009, as the Obama backlash was just gathering steam, Rush Limbaugh devoted a segment of his radio program to “Climategate. ”     That was the episode in which a climate research institute was hacked and the private emails of scientists were leaked. Conservative media sifted through the emails, stripping individual sentences and phrases out of context and spinning them to look sinister, as though scientists were coordinating and manipulating results. Mainstream media dutifully covered the “controversy. ”  No fewer than five separate investigations later cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing, but by then, for a large class of   media consumers, it was already settled history, part of shared lore. It pushed Limbaugh to new rhetorical heights.  “What this fraud, what the uncovering of this hoax, exposes,” he said, “is the corruption that exists between government and academia and science and the media. Science has been corrupted. We know the media has been corrupted for a long time. Academia has been corrupted. None of what they do is real. It’s all lies!”    He called these institutions  —   government, academia, science, and media  —   the “Four Corners of Deceit. ”              He and his listeners, he said, live in a world apart:    We live in two universes. One universe is a lie. One universe is an entire lie. Everything run, dominated, and controlled by the left here and around the world is a lie. The other universe is where we are, and that’s where reality reigns supreme and we deal with it. And seldom do these two universes ever overlap.    This is not just     ranting. It expresses something profound about the worldview of conservative media and its audience, something the mainstream media has ignored, denied, or waved away for many years.  In Limbaugh’s view, the core institutions and norms of American democracy have been irredeemably corrupted by an alien enemy. Their claims to transpartisan authority  —   authority that applies equally to all political factions and parties  —   are fraudulent. There are no transpartisan authorities; there is only   competition between tribes, the left and right. Two universes. One obvious implication of this view is that only one’s own tribe can be trusted. (Who wants to trust a “universe of lies”?)     Over time, this leads to what you might call tribal epistemology: Information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world, but on whether it supports the tribe’s values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders. “Good for our side” and “true” begin to blur into one. Now tribal epistemology has found its way to the White House.  Donald Trump and his team represent an assault on almost every American institution  —   they make no secret of their desire to “deconstruct the administrative state”  —   but their hostility toward the media is unique in its intensity. It is Trump’s obsession and favorite target. He sees himself as waging a “running war” on the mainstream press, which his consigliere Steve Bannon calls “the opposition party. ”   The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017    For the media, Trump represents a great challenge but also a great opportunity. He will make the work of journalism more difficult (calling only on sycophantic outlets during press conferences is likely just the beginning). But by putting the integrity of the press in the spotlight, he might just force a   reckoning with the role of media in democratic politics. The US political media underestimated Trump’s potential for many reasons. Prominent among them was its longstanding refusal to grapple with the deepening asymmetry in American politics  —   the rejection, by a large swath of the right, of the core institutions and norms that shape US public life.    Under Trump, that asymmetry has become glaring and inescapable. And it is bumping up against the foundations upon which all independent journalism stands.  It is time for journalism to take a side  —   to fight, not for any political party, but for the conditions that make its own existence possible. I apologize for the lengthy post, but there’s a lot of ground to cover. Let’s start with the story of the asymmetry, how it came about, and what effect it has had on the media environment. It all begins with the big sort.  America the sorted  It is well known that Americans have been sorting themselves into   communities by race, class, and ideology, creating more   homogeneity and cultural “bubbles. ”  A few years ago, Will Wilkinson looked into some research showing that the country is sorting itself by personality as well. He summarizes what he found: “liberals (low conscientiousness, high openness to experience) and conservatives (high conscientiousness, low openness) have distinctive personalities, and there’s reason to believe we’ve been sorting ourselves into communities of   similar people. ” In a fascinating new piece published in January, Wilkinson brought that evidence together with evidence from the social sciences that as a society becomes wealthier, its values tend to drift toward   and secular rationalism, away from traditionalism and survival values.     The US has long been something of an exception among developed democracies  —   it has been drifting (mildly) in the direction of traditionalism. The explanation for this, Wilkinson hypothesizes, is that the small aggregate movement is hiding an extreme divergence underneath:  [T]he United States may be dividing into two increasingly polarized cultures: an increasingly   and   oriented “ ” culture concentrated in big cities and the academic archipelago, and a largely rural and exurban culture that has been tilting in the opposite direction, toward   survival values, while trying to hold the line on traditional values. On this theory, globalization has effectively split the US into two countries: an economically booming urban country (albeit with plenty of poor people inside it) and a stagnant or declining rural and exurban one. The fate of midsize towns and cities seems to depend on which of those two currents they catch. Democrats, like economic activity, are increasingly concentrated in cities. In a paper last year, Mark Muro and Sifan Liu at the Brookings Institution found that the fewer than 500 US counties that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 represent “a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity as measured by total output in 2015. ”  Donald Trump won more than 2, 600 counties. Together, they represent just 36 percent of the nation’s economic output.            Here’s another way of viewing the economic sorting  —   a 3D map that shows spikes where the economic output is.             These two Americas have experienced diverging fortunes and have consequently been diverging in values, ideology, and even personality. Increasingly, cosmopolitan risk takers flock to cities while traditionalists remain in rural and exurban areas. (Wilkinson had yet another great piece about this in the Washington Post last week.)    Sorting has been both a driver and a consequence of the extraordinary polarization of US public life over the past several decades.  The right’s rejection of American institutions From Reagan forward, the US has become much more politically polarized, but the polarization has not been symmetrical  —   the right has become far more extreme than the left. (That story is exhaustively told in Asymmetric Politics, by political scientists David Hopkins and Matt Grossmann.) But it doesn’t help much to think of polarization as working purely along a single   axis, as though the right has simply moved further right. Instead, there has been a break, a divergence of political worldviews.  On one side is what we might call the classic liberal democratic (   ) theory of politics. In this view, politics is a kind of structured contest. Factions and parties battle over interests and policies, but the field of play on which they battle is   by a set of common institutions and norms. Inside that fence is “normal politics”  —   the subject of legitimate political dispute. Outside that fence is out of bounds, in violation of shared standards.  The “game” of politics is defined by explicit rules (e. g. the Constitution) enforced by various legally empowered referees (e. g. courts and the executive branch). But it is also defined by implicit norms, unwritten rules more informally enforced by the press, academia, and civil society. These latter institutions are referees as well, but their enforcement power operates not through law but through trust. Their transpartisan authority exists solely because participants in the game agree it does.    The idea is that when political participants step outside the ring fence and violate some shared rule or norm, they are called on it by referees and must pay some penalty, reputational or otherwise. In this way, political contests are bounded and contained, prevented from spilling over into violence or illiberalism. That’s how democracy  —   indeed, any framework of cooperation among large numbers of diverse people  —   works. Institutions and norms provide structure and limits, the shared scaffolding of cooperation. That is the classic, some might say naive, view. But there has always been a powerful strain in conservatism (think the John Birch Society) that resists seeing itself as a participant in the game at all. It sees the game itself, its rules and referees, as captured by the other side, operating for the other side’s benefit. Any claim of transpartisan authority is viewed with skepticism, as a kind of ruse or tool through which one tribe seeks to dominate another.  That’s the view Limbaugh and others in   media have consistently articulated. And it has found an increasingly receptive audience. Over time, the right’s base  —   unlike the left’s fractious and heterogeneous coalition of interest groups  —   has become increasingly homogeneous (mostly white,   and Christian) and   (traditionalist,   values).  They are temperamentally prone to fear change, but a great deal of demographic and economic change has found them anyway. Their anxiety leaves them wanting clear answers and strong leaders. And under a steady diet of radicalizing media and tribal epistemology, their traditionalism has hardened into tribalism. (If you haven’t already, you must read Amanda Taub’s “The rise of American authoritarianism. ”)         Now the   base has effectively taken over and is running the GOP. Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly come from safe districts and fear primaries from the right above all else. Trump is the base’s unbounded id, and, at least so far, the GOP is genuflecting before him.  Trump’s core supporters do not mind when he threatens the media, denigrates the courts, attacks intelligence agencies, dismisses the Congressional Budget Office, and treats the office of the presidency as a brand marketing opportunity. They have rejected the whole framework within which the two parties used to compete. They want to burn it all down.     The tribalization of information The right’s view that the institutions lean liberal is hyperbolic, but not without foundation. Science, academia (at least liberal arts and social sciences) and journalism do tend to draw their personnel from   demographics.  Those institutions have cosmopolitan aspirations  —   fair application of transpartisan standards  —   but there’s no doubt that in practice, those aspirations often cover for more parochial preferences. But the right has not sought greater fairness in mainstream institutions; it has defected to create its own. Grossmann and Hopkins recently published an article called “How Information Became Ideological. ” They sum up: [O]nly the Republican Party has actively opposed society’s central   and   institutions  —   universities and the news media  —   while Democrats have remained reliant on those institutions to justify policy choices and engage in political debate, considering them both independent arbiters and allies. Although each party’s elites, activists and voters now depend on different sources of knowledge and selectively interpret the messages they receive, the source of this information polarization is the American conservative movement’s   battle against institutions that it has deemed irredeemably liberal. [my emphasis] Democrats still largely see themselves as playing the game, bound by the ring fence, subject to common referees (e. g. science and media). That’s how most of the mainstream media sees the situation as well. But the right sees the game itself, its institutions and norms, as the enemy.  So it has waged a long war on those “  and   institutions. ” Lots of landmarks stand out  —   Limbaugh and talk radio, Drudge and internet  —   but for symbolism, it’s hard to beat Newt Gingrich, House speaker in 1995, shutting down the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) an organization created in 1972 to produce reliable nonpartisan information and analysis for members of Congress.              The OTA often produced information inconvenient to Republican policy goals, so Gingrich killed it. Afterward, journalist Chris Mooney wrote that “the new Republican majority could freely call upon its own favorable scientific ‘experts’ and rely upon more questionable and   analyses prepared by lobbyists, think tanks, and interest groups. ”     In this way, information vouchsafed by independent, transpartisan authorities was sidelined in Congress in favor of competing sets of experts and lobbyists. The information available to lawmakers was tribalized. (Meanwhile, just last week, Gingrich called for the CBO to be abolished. At least he’s consistent.)  Another significant landmark, underappreciated to this day, was the founding and rise of Fox News. (Conservative Bruce Bartlett has a great long read on the subject.) Conservatives have always believed that the mainstream media is biased against them. They’ve made a   grassroots effort out of hassling journalists about it  —   “working the refs,” in the apt phrase.  But what the right wants is not better, fairer, more scrupulous information referees. It wants tribal information. It showed what it wants by what it created.    Liberal Ted Turner created CNN, an organization that, whatever its faults (and they are legion) saw itself, and still sees itself, as a neutral referee with transpartisan authority. It has cosmopolitan aspirations. The late conservative Roger Ailes (funded by conservative Rupert Murdoch) created Fox News, a channel that carried, and still carries, mostly talk radio —  style   commentary. Like talk radio, it is of the conservative movement, in a way that no mainstream media outlet would ever think of itself as of the left. The closest thing on cable, MSNBC, is running from the liberal label as fast as it can, “balancing” Rachel Maddow with a growing roster of conservatives.   This MSNBC ad featuring network’s conservative pundits is set to run in   spaces https:  .  pic. twitter.  —   Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) June 1, 2016    Fox plopped down on cable and dared the mainstream media to say anything about it. It never saw itself as better mainstream media  —   it saw itself as a conservative competitor to a liberal incumbent. It started mainstreaming conservative talking points and conspiracies, quickly gained a huge (mostly white, mostly old) audience, and, through sheer chutzpah, was accepted as a legitimate news outlet. It’s not that Fox News hasn’t produced some good journalism and good journalists. It’s that the ultimate axis around which the enterprise revolves is partisan. It is an instrument to advance the interests of the conservative movement. When Ailes was ousted in the wake of horrific sexual harassment allegations, he almost immediately became a Trump adviser. The cat was never in the bag. In the 2016 election, Fox News remained the predominant source of political news for Trump supporters.            Of course, the reality of Fox News has never loomed as large as its influence. Cable’s audience is waning, and Fox’s core demographic (median viewer age: 68) is, not to put too fine a point on it, dying off. As the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson wrote:    The network averages about 2 million viewers each week, and Bill O’Reilly’s show fetches a bit more than 3 million. . .. Fox News is “mainstream” only by the modern and severely diluted definition of the term; Walter Cronkite once pulled audiences in the tens of millions. By any reasonable calculation, Fox News is niche. And its niche is old white men.  (Fox viewers are also, incidentally, the most misinformed of any TV audience.) Nonetheless, despite Fox’s current diminished state and demographic peril, it did its job: It threw open the door of the mainstream conversation to dozens of explicitly conservative news outlets. It established that “balance” in US media would consist of mainstream outlets striving to be neutral and conservative outlets openly leaning right.  Conservative grassroots media, the vast network of radio shows and websites that has blossomed since the 1990s, is arguably responsible for a great deal of the far right’s success. It has galvanized and mobilized a large tribe to organize and fight for its own interests.  But now establishment Republicans have caught the tiger by the tail. Originally the Washington GOP saw conservative media as a way to bypass the mainstream media and speak directly to their base. But along the way,   media became the gatekeeper, and then the power broker.  As conservative writer David Frum famously put it, “Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us. Now we’re discovering we work for Fox. ” (Longtime New York Times political reporter Jackie Calmes tells the story in a long report titled “’They Don’t Give a Damn about Governing’: Conservative Media’s Influence on the Republican Party. ”)    Conservative media has different incentives than do Republican officeholders. It doesn’t have any reason to compromise or accept partial progress. It doesn’t have any reason to grapple with unwelcome facts, calm irrational fears, or temper unrealistic expectations. It profits from ideological maximalism and a constant state of mobilized outrage.  In effect,   media took an audience already inclined to traditionalism and deliberately played on its fears and anxieties, pushing it further and further into tribalism. (That is the evolution many people in my cohort have seen in their older conservative relatives  —   from sensible fiscal conservatives in the 1980s to angry Tea Partiers in the 2010s.) The result is that conservatives are pulled with increasing gravity into an information vortex that simply has no analogue elsewhere in American politics.  The   media bubble contains much nonsense In a new study, Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, Hal Roberts, and Ethan Zuckerman of Columbia Journalism Review analyzed 1. 25 million stories published online between April 1, 2015, and the election. What they found: While concerns about political and media polarization online are longstanding, our study suggests that polarization was asymmetric.   audiences were highly attentive to traditional media outlets, which continued to be the most prominent outlets across the public sphere, alongside more   online sites. But   audiences paid the majority of their attention to polarized outlets that have developed recently, many of them only since the 2008 election season [e. g. Breitbart].   media, they write, has become “an internally coherent, relatively insulated knowledge community, reinforcing the shared worldview of readers and shielding them from journalism that challenge[s] it. ”             The devolution of the right into unchecked tribal epistemology has involved, among other things, an absolute torrent of nonsense.    Millions of   conservatives, in many cases majorities, believe that the Clintons have been involved in multiple murders, Sharia law has taken hold in the US, Obama is a Muslim (and a socialist) who was born in Kenya and seeks to destroy the US, Obama was planning a coup in Jade Helm, Democrats are running a   ring out of a DC pizza restaurant, the UN’s Agenda 21 is an international conspiracy to increase urban density, climate change is a hoax, and on and on and on.  You could list these lunacies until your fingers went numb. (Just Google “Glenn Beck’s chalkboard. ”) There are new ones every day.  The right hypes its base up with bullshit  —   it has for decades  —   until an already tribally inclined audience has now descended into   epistemic closure. It is contemptuous of outside   no matter how assiduous, but endlessly gullible toward information shared on the inside. Consequently, it is an easy target.  Even the guys who make fake news for a living discovered this. The Washington Post interviewed Paul Horner, one of the original fake news entrepreneurs, and he said this: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t   anything  —   they’ll post everything, believe anything. BuzzFeed analyzed the performance of a bunch of fake news stories (the top three of which   the top three stories from legitimate news outlets) and found “of the 20   false election stories identified in the analysis, all but three were overtly   Trump or   Clinton. ” The top story on Google News the day after the election claimed that Donald Trump won the popular vote. (In the end, he lost by 2. 8 million votes.)   In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016    Now such fantasies are being propagated by the president himself, who accused Obama of wiretapping him on the basis of “seeing a lot of things. ” When Bill O’Reilly confronted him about his claim that thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrated   Trump waved an article from Breitbart in defense.  When asked about Trump’s false statements regarding his inauguration crowd numbers, adviser Kellyanne Conway famously referred to her boss’s “alternative facts. ” When asked about Trump’s false statements regarding widespread voter fraud, his spokesperson Scottie Nell Hughes said: “Mr. Trump’s tweets, amongst a certain crowd, a large  —   a large part of the population, are truth. ”  In January, Rep. Lamar Smith (TX) said it’s “better to get your news directly from the president. In fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth. ”  That’s tribal epistemology, as clearly articulated as it ever will be.  Now even some figures in conservative media are growing leery of how detached the base has become from   or restraint, as a recent Oliver Darcy piece detailed. ”We have taught conservatives for many years to trust nothing other than what they hear in conservative media,” conservative radio host John Ziegler told Darcy. “Yet the conservative media has now proven to be untrustworthy.” Back in 2005, David Foster Wallace wrote a classic piece on the rise of   talk radio, centered on Ziegler, a war hawk and fervent conservative. Wallace worried that “the ever increasing number of ideological news outlets creates precisely the kind of relativism that cultural conservatives decry, a kind of epistemic    in which ‘the truth’ is wholly a matter of perspective and agenda. ” Now Ziegler worries about the same thing. He told Darcy: If you are a conservative talk show host, which I am, if you don’t accept that it’s likely Hillary Clinton has taken part in multiple murders, or that Barack Obama is a Muslim extremist sympathizer who was probably born outside this country  —   if you don’t accept those two things, it’s almost as if you’re a sellout. You’re a RINO [Republican in name only]. The situation was perhaps best captured by the headline on a piece from the Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell: “Americans  —   especially but not exclusively Trump voters  —   believe crazy, wrong things. ” Unfortunately, the US media is not currently in a good place to deal with this crisis of authority. Trust in the media has declined along with its power As is true in many other Western countries, trust in institutions in the US has been declining for years. (See: Twilight of the Elites, by Chris Hayes, one of the more prescient political books of the past decade.) The media is no exception. Gallup recently reported that trust in mass media is at a record low in the US:            The decline is mostly driven by Republicans and independents (the latter often, and increasingly, conservatives who do not   as Republican).            Republican trust in the mainstream media, hovering around 30 percent since about 2004, cratered last year to 14 percent. This is the culmination of the right’s long campaign against media: a base that only trusts tribal news from tribal sources. Journalism in the US has been through some traumatic times recently. The business model of newspapers and magazines fell apart, an enormous number of jobs were lost, local reporting was decimated. The number of outlets and voices exploded even as money for investigative reporting declined. The weakening and fracturing of mainstream media happened alongside (and was not unrelated to) the rise of   media, which has relentlessly challenged its legitimacy. The result, writes longtime Politico editor Susan Glasser in an essay on “Covering Politics in a ‘ ’ America,” is a cacophony:  The bully pulpits, those of the press and the pols, have proliferated, and it’s hard not to feel as though we’re witnessing a sort of revolutionary chaos: the old centers of power have been torn down, but the new ones have neither the authority nor the legitimacy of those they’ve superseded. While there was plenty of great political journalism this cycle  —   all those stories about Trump’s bogus charity, his history of scams and bankruptcies, his record as a sexual predator  —   it “didn’t seem to matter,” Glasser says. The signal was lost in the ideological noise.  Glasser goes rather too easy on the mainstream political press, which was also responsible for a lot of misleading BS during the campaign. And she is, like most US political journalists, blind to (or at least quiet about) the asymmetry of tribal news. But she is right to see it as an institutional problem, a matter of authority and legitimacy. Facts do not, contra common belief, speak for themselves. Accuracy doesn’t matter unless there are institutions and norms with the authority to make it matter. The question for the press is how to make truth matter again.     The problem is not at the level ”how to cover Trump,” but how to recover conditions in which anything journalists do makes a difference. —   Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) December 11, 2016    This is a battle the press has been avoiding for a long time, which is one reason among many its authority is at a low ebb.  In a battle over basic norms, the press cannot be neutral To understand the media’s dilemma, let’s revisit the classic liberal view of democracy, in which there is an area of normal politics bounded and structured by a set of shared rules and norms, enforced by institutions. This is still the view accepted, consciously or unconsciously, by most of the mainstream political press. It prides itself on being a neutral referee, enforcing shared standards of accuracy and honesty. (Yes, I am aware the reality falls painfully short.) But what happens when political participants step out of bounds and violate shared norms? Is it the press’s role to defend those norms, to push back, or merely to report on what has happened? It’s a dilemma. For one thing, no clear line separates legitimate subjects of political dispute from what is off limits or out of bounds. As circumstances change, those lines shift and warp at the margins. Collective values are always in flux. Things that were subject of dispute get put off limits (slavery, spousal rape) and things that were subject of consensus get opened back up to dispute (trans rights, marijuana legalization).  Instinctively, US journalists tend to see their role not as taking sides in those fights, but as accurately reporting on them. They have faced the question again and again over the past few decades. From Gingrich’s rule changes in the House through Clinton’s impeachment through George W. Bush’s theft of the 2000 election through adamantine GOP intransigence under Obama to widespread   efforts to suppress the votes of minorities, the US political media has watched the right traduce one norm after another.  Each time, it has simply taken a step back and adjusted. A major political party will simply reject the consensus of the world’s scientists on climate change? Okay. Senate Republicans will filibuster every bill now? Okay. House Republicans will routinely threaten the solvency of the country by refusing to raise the debt limit? Okay. The Senate will refuse to vote on a Supreme Court nominee in the last year of a presidency? Okay. The party will unite behind a serial swindler and   sexual predator? Okay.  It’s been one step back after another, adjusting and readjusting to a new normal in politics.  And it’s been the same with the profusion of   media. One side of America’s   system will build a giant parallel information apparatus operating on tribal lines, pushing one nonsense conspiracy theory after another into the political mainstream? Okay.  It’s all been, to use a term much abused and misused lately, normalized.             With Trump  —   his candidacy and now his presidency  —   the trampling of norms has become a stampede. The offenses range from small to large, petty to sinister. He referenced the size of his penis during a presidential primary debate, and it doesn’t even make the top 10 list of norms he’s debased.  He’s been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women. He hasn’t released his tax returns, hasn’t divested from his businesses, hasn’t appointed most positions in his government. He put a political adviser on the National Security Council, conducted classified business in the dining room of his Florida resort with unsecured phone flashlights, is giving his daughter security clearance to be his “eyes and ears” inside the White House, and accused an   of illegally surveilling him.  This is all to say nothing of his   attempt to ban Muslims from the country. That seems bad too. The norms are falling like dominoes. We’re bumping up against core principles. Are we a multiethnic democracy committed to equality under law? Do we respect science and scholarship? Do we expect public figures to tell the truth? This, finally, is the question the media must face: Can it be neutral toward a political movement that explicitly rejects core American institutions and norms?   The limits of journalistic neutrality It’s difficult to see how.  Journalism as practiced in the US is premised on professional norms of accuracy and fairness. Journalists and outlets very often fail to conform to those norms, or to apply them consistently, but the enterprise is founded on the notion that accuracy matters, that it means the same thing for everyone, that it can be reliably identified by knowledge communities like scientists, scholars, and field researchers, and that all sides in political disputes are accountable to it. That enterprise is impossible, by definition, if all sides have their own truths. If there are no institutions with transpartisan credibility capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood, then for all intents and purposes, there is no truth  —   only individual and tribal truths, assembled like Facebook profiles. Politics becomes a pure contest of power. At a deeper level, healthy journalism relies on the basic institutions and norms of liberal democracy  —   on transpartisan authorities capable of establishing a common bedrock of facts and rules. As we’ve seen in other democracies around the world that succumb to autocracy (think Russia, Hungary, Turkey, Venezuela) the decline in institutions is both cause and consequence of authoritarianism.  As journalist Melik Kaylan puts it, “no ‘normalization’ happens under the corrective effect of institutions. Rather, institutions themselves get eroded. ”  If it is premised on the integrity of transpartisan institutions and norms, then how can journalism be neutral toward a political movement that rejects them? How can it be neutral toward the preconditions of its own existence? In doing so, it can only negate itself. Only strong institutions and norms can maintain the media’s tenuous position Defending core American institutions and norms does not come naturally to the American press. As Brian Beutler wrote in an essay last September, the US media is uncomfortable seeing itself as a guardian of anything beyond the narrowest press prerogatives like transparency and treatment of reporters.  This reticence is not unfounded. To defend broader civic norms and liberal institutions  —   equality before law, freedom of religion and assembly, respect for science, basic honesty and consistency  —   is to defend the preconditions for the existence of a healthy, independent media. But it is also, inescapably, to be at odds with an administration bent on degrading those norms and institutions. That puts political journalists in a tenuous (and, if things get really bad, possibly unsafe) position.  They must figure out a way to play a dual role: to be fair and consistent referees of policy and ideological disputes within the public square  —   while also acting to defend the institutional integrity of the square itself from what is, at present, a highly asymmetrical threat. They must fight to keep some core principles and commitments inviolate, outside the sphere of normal political dispute, against an administration that wants to drag them in. They must resist authoritarianism and tribal epistemology, which are disproportionately animating one of America’s two political parties, without acting consciously on behalf of the other party. They cannot afford to be, or be seen as, primarily instruments of the Democrats. That’s a humdinger of a problem. And there’s no guarantee the US media will solve it any better than the media did in all those newly minted autocracies. It may be unsolvable, or at least at the mercy of larger social forces than journalism. If it is solved, it will not be, in my view, on the demand side  —   by training media consumers to be more discerning. Too many of the tropes and delivery mechanisms of modern media are designed precisely to bypass critical filters. And everyone is subject to some tribalism, to biases and bubbles, in the best of circumstances. Similarly, it’s unlikely to be solved by individual journalists or media outlets. Their incentives are all askew. Modern media properties generally survive through advertising, which means above all they must seek scale and reach, especially on social media, and above all on Facebook.             Especially if you’re not one of the bigs (e. g. the New York Times) with tons of existing brand equity, it’s often easier to go after a tribe. Tribal audiences bring intensity, which brings more clicks, views, shares, and reach, which bring more advertising.  Only two forces can counteract this basic incentive. One is the values and integrity of individual journalists and outlets. But as Glasser said, in an undifferentiated chaos of news, even good journalists and good journalism have trouble rising above the din. And anyway, relying on good hearts and good intentions is not a stable   strategy. The other countervailing force is (at risk of repeating myself) norms and institutions  —   standards of accuracy and professional conduct in journalism and trusted civic or professional institutions to enforce them. Good journalism must bring some (reputational and ultimately financial) reward and bad journalism some censure. The alternative is further epistemic tribalism and attendant illiberalism, which undermine journalism’s health.  Institutions like journalism draw their authority from trust. With enough of it, journalism can become a true “fourth estate,” an independent power center with an existence separate and distinct from dueling political factions. Without at least some trust that bridges tribal lines, its authority wanes, and it can only passively report as tribalism takes over. In the end, for building trust, there simply is no substitute for A) guild professionals with special expertise in gathering and assessing information, B) strong norms to govern their behavior, C) institutions to enforce those norms and vouchsafe good work, and D) social norms granting those professionals some transpartisan authority. The US has lots of A, but not much of B, C, or D.  The answer is . .. ha ha, jk If you waded through all 7 million words of this post, you were probably hoping I’d finish with a solution, or at least some good suggestions. I am here to disappoint you.  There’s tons of advice floating around for individual journalists  —   be firm but fair, etc. etc.  —   but I’ve seen very little thinking or writing about how to strengthen journalism as such, the set of institutions and norms that comprise it.  I’m not sure what a certifying institution would even look like. The other day on Pod Save America, Katie Couric said that journalism needs some sort of “Good Housekeeping seal of approval. ” That expresses what I think is a very common, if inchoate, sentiment, which I share. Many people want to see outside their bubbles but lack reliable direction. It’s a jungle out there. But Couric said nothing about what such an institution might look like, how it might be established or staffed, how it could resist being, or being seen as, biased  —   how it could build the broad trust needed to be effective. And I’m afraid I don’t have any ideas either, at least not any worth sharing here.  So I suppose I have the writer’s lamest aspiration of all: to “start a conversation. ” I don’t know how to solve the problem, but I feel pretty confident it is located at the level of institutions and norms. One way or another, the media has got to hang the rules on the wall, reify and reaffirm its commitment to shared norms of accuracy, independence, fairness, and decency. It has to draw lines, reward quality, and resist the epistemic chaos that America’s aspiring autocrat is pulling in his wake.  There’s no other choice. In the end, if tribal epistemology wins, journalism loses. "
" ”Some firms are super successful, posting high returns year after year after year, and other firms are pretty mediocre. Of course, that’s always true   …     but the gap between them has grown enormously. Combine that with the fact that if you work for a more successful company, you will be paid more even if you’re doing exactly the same job and have exactly the same skills you would’ve brought to a less successful company. This increased inequality among firms translates through to wages and is generating and contributing to some of the increase in inequality we’re seeing.”  —   Jason Furman         Jason Furman has been described as the ”wonkiest wonk in the White House.” For the past three years, he’s worked as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers  —   Obama’s chief economist  —   but he’s been an important part of Obama’s brain trust since the 2008 campaign, helping design the stimulus and Obamacare. He’s also just a very interesting person; he had a teenage career as a street juggler in Greenwich Village, and was college roommates with Matt Damon, who describes him as ”one of the smartest people that I’ve come across.” And in the later years of the administration, he’s started doing some really interesting research into rent seeking: a term economists use for ways in which people and businesses try to get more money for themselves without actually creating anything of value. That additional slice of the pie is known as a ”rent.” What Furman has found is that zoning rules that make it hard to build in big cities, and occupational licensing requirements that keep people out of jobs, are generating huge rents for landlords and license holders, and holding back the economy a lot in the process.    I recently sat down with Furman for a special episode of The Weeds. (You can listen to our discussion by subscribing to the podcast or streaming it on SoundCloud.) Listen to hear about rent seeking but also:     What Furman is proudest of achieving in the White House Why he still supports the Cadillac tax when Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are calling for its repeal Why Medicaid’s still a good deal despite that Oregon study casting doubt on it How the share of   men outside the labor force has been steadily growing  —   and no one really knows why What we can learn from Chinese trade’s effects on American jobs  For more podcast conversations  —   including episodes with Rachel Maddow, Bill Gates, political scientist Theda Skocpol, Sen. Cory Booker, restaurateur David Chang, and conservative activist Grover Norquist  —   you should also subscribe to The Ezra Klein Show. Show notes  The Cadillac tax, explained  David Cutler’s case for the tax The case that the tax won’t work  Furman defends the tax in a speech last year, and with Matthew Fiedler in a New England Journal of Medicine article this February (paywalled) The Amy Finkelstein, Nathaniel Hendren, and Erzo Luttmer paper on why Medicaid users might just prefer getting cash What the Oregon Health Study really said The case that the study was ”underpowered”  The Anna   Deaton study showing rising death rates for   white people Furman and Peter Orszag’s paper on rent seeking   Transcript Dylan Matthews: We’re less than a year until the end of this administration. You’ve been here since the beginning. What, looking back, are you proudest of having been involved in, and what is you’re biggest regret that you weren’t able to get done? Jason Furman: Proudest would be two things. One is a set of policies that helped save the economy from going into a second Great Depression. The recovery act was larger than anything we’d ever done before in this country. It had a huge amount both in terms of macro policy but also energy, innovation, dealing with poverty, putting us in a better position to deal with a lot of the issues that our country faces. Together with a bunch of other steps it worked and we’re in better shape today than most of the other advanced economies because of those efforts.    The second thing is the Affordable Care Act, which is not just twenty million people with health insurance, not just contributing to the slowest health cost growth in fifty years through a range of measures showing quality is better but is also the biggest step we’ve taken on inequality in decades. Having been a part of both of those is two of the proudest things I’ve done with my life. DM: Let’s dig in a little bit to the second point since I think this doesn’t get covered a lot in coverage of the Affordable Care Act. What do we know about its effect on inequality? Do we have numbers on that yet or just a sort of general sense of the structure? JF: We’re working to do a better quantification of that. When you have tax subsidies for people between a hundred and four hundred percent of poverty. A medicaid expansion in all the states that have taken it up and, obviously, they all should take it up. All the states that have taken it up for people up to a 138% of poverty you’re talking about something that represents a very progressive change. Those changes were funded, in part, by steps like taking the Medicare tax which right now had historically applied to earned income and applying it to unearned income. You had to pay it on your capital gains and dividends in addition to your work. DM: That sort of debate over healthcare has opened up again this election cycle. As huge of an achievement as the Affordable Care Act is there are, obviously, some holes. There’s still a large uninsured population much smaller than it was but still substantial. What do you think is the next step if you were devising a set of ways to expand it? Would it be a public option or   rate setting, global budgeting? What do you think of as being part of a package like that? JF: The next steps are, frankly, to fully implement it. The important set of those steps are in the hands of governors and state legislatures that have outrageously chosen not to take a ninety percent Federal match, a hundred percent initially, to do something that is right by their citizens, right by their economies, so getting all those states in. The Affordable Care Act gave us a lot of tools on the delivery system. It gave us a huge amount of flexibility to experiment in Medicare and find ways to either save money without worsening quality or improve quality without hurting cost. We’re continuing to roll things out and deploy things based on that.    Then the final thing the Affordable Care Act gave us was the most powerful tool we have to create an incentive for less health care cost in the private sector which is the Cadillac tax and that is scheduled to go into effect in 2020. There’s some reforms we could do to target it better but the most important thing is making sure that goes into effect. There’s certainly more we could do. There’s more we could legislate before we even have that conversation. There’s a lot of tools we already have in this law that we haven’t yet fully put to use and to keep pushing that forward. DM: How much does it worry you that both Democratic candidates want to repeal the Cadillac tax outright? JF: I am not going to comment on an election but as a matter of public policy I think the Cadillac tax is a combination of lowering health costs, raising wage growth, cutting the deficit and complimenting the other changes in the Affordable Care Act. I think it is a really important progressive priority and part of the overall strategy to raise wages and for that reason I think it’s important. DM: The argument there is once we start treating health benefits closer to how we treat wages the bias towards doing compensation in regards of health insurance rather than wages will be reduced. People’s wages will go up. There’s an argument used sometimes here from labor quarters. I know Josh Bivens at EPI has made this argument that the empirical case there isn’t there. We don’t have an experience of analogous situations employers diverting compensation back to wages. Are you persuaded by that argument? JF: I think there’s a strong theoretical case that when health costs are growing up really quickly employers aren’t going to pay the same types of wage increases. There’s a strong empirical case and a range of studies but finally there’s just a practical common sense one. You can go through everyone who’s ever been at the bargaining table and they have quotes from a decade ago saying health cost growth is so high that when we get to the bargaining table the employer is telling us they won’t give us a wage increase because all of our money went to extra health benefits and the health benefit cost growth is really hurting our wages. The question then is the converse also has to be true. It has to be a lot easier to bargain for wage increase in a world where you don’t have to spend as much time and energy fighting for those extra dollars on health. DM: From the other perspective there’s an emerging critique, not just of the Affordable Care Act but of Medicaid, in general, deriving from this Oregon study. There’s a contention that the health effects we saw in this random case where Oregon Lottery to access to a Medicaid expansion that there weren’t huge physical health benefits. There were some mental health gains. Also there’s a recent interpretation of the study arguing that it suggested Medicaid recipients valued the benefits significantly less than the cash value. Maybe it would be better to just give people the money rather than providing it through an insurance system. I’m curious what you make of that since it obviously hasn’t changed your overall view on the wisdom of this policy but it does seem to be affecting the debate. JF: I think there’s three sets of reasons why you’d want public subsidies for health insurance for lower income households. The most important is health and I’ll come back to that. Second is it’s a way to get more money or more resources in the hands of people that need it, addressing the inequality that we were talking about before, the progressivity.    Third, giving someone a dollar versus giving them insurance. If they really need it they get a lot more than a dollar and if they didn’t maybe they don’t get anything is more valuable even if the average cost is just a dollar than giving someone a dollar. I don’t want to lose that health part which was the first and most important argument. I think the Oregon study gave us pretty clear evidence of certain health benefits, both   how people felt about their health and in areas like mental health, which you referred to. On almost everything else the study was what an economist would call  . The study only followed people for a year and a half because after a year and a half everyone got into Medicaid. You give someone insurance for a year and a half, you ask how much more they’re going to go to a doctor. How much more is a year and a half of a doctor going to make a difference and you’d predict it would make a difference. Not a massive, massive difference but a meaningful difference. You compare that prediction to what they found they found something pretty similar to that they just didn’t have a large enough sample size to proclaim that as statistically significant. I don’t think the study could have found definitive health impacts because there just weren’t enough people in it and it didn’t last for long enough. DM: To move onto the first thing you were proudest of working on, the economic recovery. We’re recording this shortly after the latest jobs report came out and we were talking before we were recording we don’t see the    ratio of   men, so men from 25 to 54, back to where it was before the recession, that it’s better than the nadir of the recession but it’s not where it was previously. You had an interesting explanation for why you think that is and it’s, in some ways, more concerning than just the economy not having fully recovered. JF: Let me start with a positive story. The unemployment rate was 10 percent, it’s now 5 percent. The official unemployment rate doesn’t count discouraged workers. If you count them you see the same trend. It doesn’t account people working   for economic reasons. You count them you also see the same trend. Whatever measure of unemployment you use it is way down and the broader measures of unemployment have actually recently fallen more quickly than the official measure of unemployment. We really have seen a remarkable recovery in our labor market. It’s a little bit like a huge wave came crashing in and then the wave recedes and two things happened. It had a little bit of damage that it leaves in its wake but you can also see what was there on the beach before the wave rolled up over it. What was there on the beach was a sixty year long decline in the percentage of men between the age of 25 and 54,     men who were in the workforce. In the 1950s 97 percent of men were in the workforce either in a job or looking for a job. Only 3 percent were out of it. It steadily, decade after decade, grew to be 12 percent. In fact, every single economic recovery we’ve had in this   period save one the employment population ratio for   men ended up lower than where it was before the recession. In that sense you never have ever fully recovered from a recession. I think that’s a trend we see that’s been going on for a long time.    It’s concentrated among men with less education. It’s not because their spouses are working. Less than a quarter of them have a working spouse. It’s not because disability insurance is out of control. Disability insurance is a small fraction of those people who are out of the labor force. I think it’s something about our economic system that we really need to worry about and work on solving. DM: We have four times as many working age men that are not in the workforce as we did 60 years ago and we basically have no idea why. JF: We know a certain amount about who they are, less education, less skills. There’s a number of explanations we can rule out but absolutely we don’t have a great explanation. You don’t need to have a perfect explanation of something to get to work solving it. Extra infrastructure would help us solve this wage insurance, help people get back into a job would solve it. There’s a whole bunch of things that would make it better. DM: Do we have any longitudinal sense, do we have a sense if these were men who were at one point were working and then lost a job and had trouble recovering? Is it people who are just sort of persistently excluded? JF: It seems to be that the losses are concentrated in recession. Your in the workforce, you lose your job, you don’t get back on your feet and you stay out of the workforce thereafter seems to be the predominant story. DM: Is this concentrated in particular industries? Is it that men who are working in a manufacturing or a construction job that is pretty   but not super   lose their job and then what’s available for them are sales clerk positions that won’t get them on their feet? JF: It certainly coincides with a decline in manufacturing as a share of the economy. I haven’t followed the particular workers in the data to ask where they came from and which industry they entered from. I think that’s an interesting question. DM: How do these people get by? Do we know anything about if they’re not working and they’re not mostly on disability insurance and they’re not mostly getting money from their spouse if this isn’t a    dad situation? You’re also saying that this is concentrated in people with lower income. It’s not like we have a bunch of   year olds getting PhDs. JF: Or collecting dividend checks. DM: Right. JF: Yeah, the data aren’t clear about that and people aren’t starving. People are getting income from somewhere. Maybe it’s from a family member. Maybe there’s some government program although there aren’t a whole lot for   men without children. To some degree this is a similar group to the one that’s seen it’s mortality go up, that’s seen it’s opioid use go up. There’s a set of bigger problems that we need to worry about in that community. DM: Is some of this a failure of response to not just the decline of manufacturing but of specifically to trade? The David Otter study on the effects of opening to China, while not terribly definitive, debunking of the idea that we should have been open to trade to China did suggest that the losses for jobs among a certain segment of men were pretty massive in certain areas. Did we just not handle that shock well? JF: I think we haven’t handled . .. There’s been a set of technological changes, a set of changes associated with trade and globalization. China’s entry in the world economy is, in some sense, sui generis. We’d never seen anything that large, and we’re not going to see something that large again.    You look at something like TPP, that’s with a different set of countries with a different set of rules associated with it with a different set of disproportionately knocking down barriers overseas. You don’t want all trade and all trade agreements lumped together to say you learned something from that experiment with China for something that’s very different. Certainly, I think in terms of connective tissue that you have labor markets that helps connect people to new jobs, train them to new jobs, motivate them to think they can do those new jobs. We do flexibility really well in the United States, but we do flexibility for employers, not for employees and it takes more than flexibility to make labor markets work. DM: Why aren’t employers doing more here? In certain industries you hear all the time about these app academies that are opening up for people who want to learn to be programmers because there’s such a shortage of labor for programming companies that their sort of making their own supply there. Why isn’t that happening for   professions? JF: I don’t know. I hear from businesses all the time the talk about how hard it is to find workers. I always ask them, Well, what if you paid an extra $2 an hour? Would it get easier to find those workers? Then there’s a reason why that doesn’t work. There’s a little bit of a disconnect between what you hear in terms of the difficulty of finding workers and what you see in terms of wages. We have over the last three years seen wages at the tenth percentile grow faster than at any other percentile of distribution and wages in the middle growing decently. In terms of the   several decades that’s not what we’ve seen in the market. That, to me, suggests in broad economic terms is it a supply of workers? People don’t won’t to work. If people don’t want to work two things should happen. Fewer of them will work, but the ones who still are working will become really   and their wages will go up. We’ve seen half of that. The other explanation is less demand and you don’t want as many of those types of workers. What do you see then? Less people working, check. Lower relative wage, check. It feels a little bit more like something that’s happened on the demand side of the economy. DM: This is a theory that Larry Summers has put out there a lot in recent years that we might just be in a time when there is not enough demand in the economy and not just because we had a recession and, obviously, there’s a shortfall of demand there, but just as a general matter. Do you buy that and, if so, do you buy his prescription that we might need persistent deficit spending for the foreseeable future to keep the economy in gear? JF: That’s a little bit of a different issue than we’ve just been talking about.    DM: Sure. JF: We’ve been talking about something that’s been going for 60 years that might have to do with a demand for a certain type of worker as opposed to an aggregate demand in a macro economic sense. I think we had massively deficient demand in 2008 and 9 and physical stimulus was appropriate then and monetary expansion was appropriate then. We have today still some insufficiency of demand and monetary policy can make its own decisions without me commenting on it. What we did last year with the fiscal deal of buying back 90% of the sequester means that we actually have mildly expansionary Federal fiscal policy. I think that’s good news for the economy in 2016 and a reason to be optimistic. Do I think we need to radically change in good times and bad the rule around fiscal policy? Probably not. Do I think we need to be more attentive to the importance of fiscal policy in recessions? Probably yes. DM: I wanted to be sure we got to some of the work you’ve been doing on rents and on ways in which rents from housing and other things have contributed to inequality and hurt the economy. You recently had a paper on this with Peter Orszag. Did you want to briefly layout your main points there and we can go from there? JF: Sure. We start with a few facts and then figure out an interpretation that helps make sense of all these facts. One fact is we all know that the rate of profit has drifted up and the profit share has drifted up. What’s even more striking is if you go below the aggregate level and look at firms and you see some firms are super successful, posting high returns year after year after year and other firms are pretty mediocre. Of course, that’s always true. There’s always some that are better than average and some that are worse than average. The gap between them has grown enormously. Combine that with the fact that if you work for a more successful company you will be paid more even if you’re doing exactly the same job and have exactly the same skills you would have brought to a less successful company. This increased inequality among firms translates through to wages and is generating and contributing to some of the increase in inequality that we’re seeing which is still mostly inequality in the labor market is at the biggest root cause of our increase in inequality. Then the next question is why is it that some businesses are becoming much, much more successful? I think part of the answer is that an economy that’s broadly competitive will compete away those extra profits, but an economy where many sectors are becoming more concentrated, where many firms have figured out ways to erect barriers to entry is one in which you can year after year after year get extra profits without somebody else entering and competing them away. I think that’s part of what’s gone on. The flip side of that is a great opportunity in terms of public policy and the thing that we all love most as economists is when we find something where there isn’t a  . Actually, I think the thing that economists love most is pointing out   and making people sad about them. I personally get even more excited if I can find a way to improve efficiency and reduce inequality. Expanding competition, reducing some of these rents I think is one way to do that.    DM: I think the connection here to housing might be a little oblique to some people. JF: Sorry. I keep using the word rent. Rent is an old economic term, that is you get a rate of return not that you needed to do in order to do it but just a extra bonus because you had the thing. It’s that extra bonus that is a wonderful thing to get if you’re the one getting it but from the perspective of the economy as a whole may not be so wonderful. DM: One thing you point out is that a lot of these rents are often literally from rent, that the rate of return for landlords especially in certain set of highly productive urban areas, DC, San Frisco, New York, has gone way up. What do you make of why that is? JF: It’s harder to build in certain places and economics teaches you about supply and demand and if you don’t increase supply as much and that’s colliding against increasing demand the result is, as your colleague Matt Iglesias said, The rent is too damn high, or house prices are. I think those types of land use restrictions, and it’s not just the inconvenience of what it means for the cost of your rent. It’s that it stops people from moving to precisely the places where people want to live, in many cases want to live because they’re more productive, they have higher wages. One of the dynamics that had fueled the US economy was convergence. Places that had lower incomes converged to places that were higher incomes. They caught up. Maybe jobs moved there to take advantage of the opportunities or the people moved to where the jobs are but either way you saw a certain amount of convergence. We’re seeing less convergence now. We’re seeing less convergence because it’s just harder for people to move to where the opportunities are. DM: This seems to put us in a weird situation where one of the biggest macro economic problems we have as a country is controlled by policy at not even the state but the city level. With the exception of DC most places the building rules are not set by Congress. They’re set by the city council, the mayor. What role do you as someone in the White House have in trying to solve this? JF: One thing is drawing attention to it and just making sure people can see the issue documented and the consequences of it documented. Talk to mayors, talk to local officials. We have a budget proposal which would have Federal subsidies that would be incentive payments for localities to take innovative steps to help address this issue. It’s something where we already subsidize housing in this country and to make sure those subsidies are geared towards addressing this. You’re absolutely right that ultimately the decisions here are and should be local decisions. DM: Another area where you’ve identified rents is occupational licensing. I wanted to get a sense of how big of a problem you think that is. It seems like when we’re talking about rents housing comes up as the biggest one and occupational licensing is second. How much progress is there to be made there? JF: In the 1950s 5% of people needed a license to engage in their jobs. Doctors did, lawyers did, many others didn’t. Now it’s 25% of people need a state license. Partly that’s because we have a larger health sector and a larger education sector and those areas are heavily licensed, but that’s only about a third of the increase in licensing. The other   is just with any occupation there is more licensing. A lot like the land use restrictions this is something that happens, these are decisions at the state level. The problem is the way in which these decisions are often made is a group of people who already have the credential get to make the decision about whether other people can come in and do that job too. The problem is that the result of this lower wages for people who can’t get into it but also higher prices. This isn’t a great way to band together and pry profits out of the hands of the millionaires and billionaires and get them into the hands of the people. This is about almost taking nickles and dimes from the people and moving them up.    I think this is a real issue. It, once again, is a state issue. Once again we’re using our bully pulpit. We have some funding that we got from Congress last year to help create incentives to do this. We’re really trying to work with companies and legislatures in certain areas, especially like  . In many of these licenses they’re just categorically excluded from getting them. Large numbers of jobs they’re just literally not allowed to have under state law and that’s a big problem especially in a country that has so many  . DM: Is this something that a lot of these licenses are voluntary. The American Bar Association is not a government entity. A lot of these are professional associations. Does that limit what the government can do to stem this trend? JF: The Supreme Court, you had a case of dentists in North Carolina who had made rules for themselves and the Supreme Court ruled against them on   grounds saying that a group couldn’t basically make rules about who could and couldn’t compete in its area. They said the state could make that rule. They just couldn’t delegate the making of that rule to the people on who’s behalf that rule was being made. I think process here matters. One of our recommendations has been that states establish sunrise commissions. Rather than delegate to each group the licensing of itself you have a commission that anytime you want a new license you look and you ask, Does it pass a cost benefit test? Not, Is it in the interest of the group that decided it wants a license? but from a broader public perspective. States like Maine that have done that have used those types of institutions successfully. "
" Donald Trump does not exactly have a record in public office that can be used to assess his likely performance going forward. Nor does he really have a policy platform in a traditional sense.    What he does is speak. A lot. Trump’s words  —   at rallies, on television shows, and in press conferences  —   have been the alpha and omega of his campaign. And his nomination acceptance speech, delivered Thursday night in Cleveland, is the biggest, most important speech he’s given yet. Painting a bleak period of a nation facing a ”moment of crisis,” Trump pledged an emergency response to a growing set of threats to the physical security of everyday Americans as well as a broad range of economic woes. The speech featured striking claims about ”chaos in our communities” and widespread violence, and a bold promise that ”the crime and violence that afflict our communities will soon  —   and I mean very soon  —   come to an end.”    ”I will present the facts plainly and honestly,” Trump said. But did he? We counted dozens of factual claims in the speech, and fewer than half scored as true or almost true. But there were also plenty of falsehoods, misleading or disputed claims, or baseless accusations.     Trump says: ”Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.” In fact: Crime has indeed plummeted for decades  —   a fact to keep in mind throughout Trump’s speech. The murder rate, for example, fell by more than half from a peak in 1980 (10. 2 per 100, 000 people) to a decade low in 2014 (4. 5 per 100, 000 people).    But there’s simply no evidence that a federal ”rollback of criminal enforcement” has led to a reversal of those trends. The murder rate was at historic lows in 2014, and there aren’t full nationwide statistics for all of 2015 or even part of 2016 yet. It’s also not clear that there’s been any rollback in law enforcement at all (Trump doesn’t name any specific policies) or whether any policy changes by the Obama administration would make any difference, since the overwhelming majority of policing is done at the local and state level. Research has found that shifts in policing were only a partial cause for the violent crime drop over the past 25 years, making it unlikely that any Obama policies would have a huge impact on the crime drop.  —  German Lopez Ruling: Baseless  —   —   Trump says: ”Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.”    In fact: Trump is referring to research that found a 17 percent increase in homicides in large US cities, including alarming spikes in Washington, DC, and Baltimore. For DC, that sharp increase came between 2014 and 2015  —   so far in 2016, murder is down 9 percent. But what Trump leaves out is that one of the researchers behind this work, Richard Rosenfeld, has repeatedly said that it’s way too early to say whether this trend is applicable to the rest of the country or whether it truly indicates a reversal to the   violent crime drop of the past 25 years. And even if the nationwide murder rate increased by 17 percent in 2015, that rate would remain far, far below the peaks of the 1960s and ’70s and below any period in the ’90s.  —  German Lopez Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”In the president’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2, 000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And almost 4, 000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.” In fact: Trump is right that there have been more than 2, 000 victims of shootings in 2016, and that there have been nearly 4, 000 homicides in Chicago since Obama took office. That said, there’s simply no evidence that ”this administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement” caused violent crime to rise. And while it is true that America has more shootings than other developed nations, researchers generally attribute that to the country’s enormous number of guns, not law enforcement.  —  German Lopez Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year.”    In fact: This statistic apparently comes from an outdated, poorly worded USA Today headline. But according to the Officer Down Memorial Page,   deaths of police officers are actually down 1 percent in 2016 compared to the same point in 2015. If this trend continues throughout the year, 2016 will be near a historic low for   deaths. (This site tracks total deaths, not just killings, but there’s no   death tracker with 2016 data that solely tracks killings.) It’s possible Trump is referring to the fact that   deaths specifically from gunfire are up by 84 percent over the past year  —   which adds up to 31   deaths by gunfire so far this year. All   deaths are tragic. But despite Trump’s rhetoric painting the country as in a state of chaos,   deaths remain rare, and 2016’s increase in gunfire deaths so far came after decades of decline.  —  German Lopez Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”Nearly 180, 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.” In fact: There are indeed about 180, 000 immigrants with criminal records still in the United States who have been ordered deported. But the assumption that all of them are ”threaten[ing] peaceful citizens” is deeply questionable. The federal government estimated in October 2015 that there are 918, 369 immigrants living in the US who have been formally ordered to be deported by a judge. (Some of these immigrants have to stay in the US because there’s no diplomatic agreement to return them to their home countries; others may not know that a deportation order was ever signed against them; still others are fugitives from the law.) Of those, 179, 027 had criminal convictions.    However, the government doesn’t specify what those convictions were for; in the past, many of the immigrants deported as ”criminal aliens” had only been convicted of minor crimes, or had been convicted of entering or reentering the US illegally rather than of anything they’d done when in the US.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: The statistic is true, the threat is questionable  —   —   Trump says: ”The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015.” In fact: Trump is referring to the number of immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents. (In other words, the number of immigrants who’ve been caught.) These are people who have entered the US without papers, but they’re not necessarily ”illegal”; it’s legal to cross into the US to request asylum, and that’s just what many families have done. His numbers need closer scrutiny, though. So far in calendar year 2016 (as of June 30) 29, 682 immigrants traveling as families have been apprehended  —   way fewer than the 53, 840 members of family units apprehended over calendar year 2015. So what’s he talking about? Donald Trump’s actually referring to fiscal year 2016  —   which started in October of last year. So far in fiscal year 2016 (as of June 30) 51, 152 members of ”family units” have been apprehended by Border Patrol; in all of fiscal year 2015, only 39, 838 members of family units were apprehended. If you think in fiscal years, this might check out. But if you’re among the millions of Americans who think of years as calendar years, you’ll get the wrong impression here.  —  Dara Lind    Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources. One such border crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root.” In fact: Immigrants caught by Border Patrol are deported (sometimes after serving a US prison term) unless they seek some form of legal status in the US, like asylum. But it can take years in court to determine whether they’re eligible for it, and in the meantime, many immigrants are in fact released into the community. This is especially likely for ”unaccompanied alien children,” since the Department of Health and Human Services doesn’t have the resources to care for the immigrants it’s charged with. That’s what happened to Eswin Mejia, who was apprehended crossing the border in 2013, released into his brother’s custody later that year, and charged in February with felony motor vehicle homicide in Sarah Root’s death. The reason that Trump is telling this story, of course, is to imply that all unauthorized immigrants are lawless. In fact, immigrants are less likely than citizens to commit crimes. But to Trump and his followers, the very fact that someone doesn’t yet have legal status in the US is proof that he’s on some level a criminal.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”Nearly 4 in 10   children are living in poverty.” In fact: According to the official poverty measure (an imperfect metric) 38 percent of black children lived in poverty in 2014.  —  Dylan Matthews    Ruling: True.  —   —   Trump says: ”58 percent of   youth are not employed.” In fact: CNN’s Tami Luhby looked into this claim and found that the 58 percent figure was extrapolated from the fact that roughly 42 percent of black Americans ages 16 to 24 were employed as of earlier this year. That’s an erroneous way to calculate; many of those people aren’t unemployed but are simply in school or otherwise not looking for work. It’s technically true to say they’re ”not employed,” but that gives a misleading impression that they’re out of work and struggling.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago.” In fact: In 2008, the year before Obama took office, the Hispanic poverty rate was 23. 3 percent; the more accurate Supplemental Poverty Measure put the number at 30 percent. In 2014, the most recent year for which there are numbers, the official rate was 23. 8 percent and the SPM rate was 25. 4 percent. Assuming Trump is going by the official numbers, poverty was slightly higher  —   and because of population growth, that meant the number of Hispanics in poverty was 13. 2 million in 2014, versus about 11 million in 2008. That’s where Trump gets his 2 million increase number. But this isn’t a case where using raw numbers is informative. If you use rates, the Hispanic poverty rate was either roughly unchanged or, using the more accurate metric, reduced in Obama’s time in office.  —  Dylan Matthews    Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.” In fact: In January 2009, the civilian labor force participation rate was 65. 7 percent. In June 2016, it was 62. 7 percent. That’s a real decline, one driven by a mixture of population aging, economic weakness, and a   trend of lower labor force participation for older men. But Trump’s literal claim is that 14 million people have left the workforce. In January 2008, there were 154 million people in the US labor force. Last month, there were 158. 9 million. Close to 5 million people have been added to the labor force.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”Household incomes are down more than $4, 000 since the year 2000.” In fact: In 2014, the real median household income was $53, 657, according to the Census Bureau. In 2000, it was $57, 724, after adjusting for inflation. It has indeed declined by more than $4, 000 in real terms.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”Our trade deficit in goods reached  —   think of this  —   our trade deficit is $800 billion last year alone.”    In fact: This is just false. The manufacturing trade deficit is large, but it was $681 billion in 2015, not ”nearly $800 billion.” It’s also worth noting that many economists do not consider high trade deficits to be inherently bad.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion and growing.” In fact: Total public debt was $11. 2 trillion in quarter one of 2009 and had risen to $19. 3 trillion by quarter one of 2016. That’s not a doubling, although Trump hedged with ”almost.” That said, a lot of that debt is money that the US owes to itself in the form of Social Security trust fund bonds and the like. For that reason, most economists prefer to look at ”debt held by the public”: that is, national debt not including that owned by the government itself. That has more than doubled, from $6. 8 trillion in Q1 2009 to $13. 9 trillion in Q1 2016. As a share of the economy, though, the debt definitely hasn’t doubled, rising from 47. 5 percent to 76. 4 percent.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and 43 million Americans are on food stamps.”    In fact: It is true that there are approximately 43 million Americans on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps. It is also true that American infrastructure could do with major improvements, as President Barack Obama called for in his 2015 State of the Union speech. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers report card for infrastructure, the United States receives a D+. However, claiming that American airports are in Third World conditions is, at best, an exaggeration. According to Priceonomics, which analyzed reviews of 17, 000 airports worldwide, America’s still rank among the best.  —  Tara Golshan Ruling: Exaggerated  —   —   Trump says: ”The Iran deal . .. gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing  —   it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made.” In fact: Experts say the value of Iranian assets that have become ”unfrozen” as a result of the nuclear agreement is probably closer to $100 billion than $150 billion, and much of that won’t immediately be available to Iran because it is tied up in other debts. Thus, experts estimate the actual amount that Iran is able to access is somewhere in the $35 billion to $60 billion range. Furthermore, the United States does in fact get something out of the deal: In exchange for unfreezing these assets, Iran is complying with the requirements of the nuclear agreement that makes it much harder for the country to build a nuclear weapon.  —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”In Libya, our consulate  —   the symbol of American prestige around the globe  —   was brought down in flames.”    In fact: The US Special Mission compound and Annex in Benghazi, Libya, were attacked on September 11 and 12, 2012, with arson, mortar fire, and other weapons, resulting in the deaths of four US government personnel and the destruction and abandonment of both facilities. The buildings were a relatively remote diplomatic outpost and as such were not themselves global symbols of American prestige. However, inasmuch as all US diplomatic facilities are symbols of US influence in the countries in which they are located, it is reasonable to conclude that the facilities in Benghazi were attacked in large part because of their symbolic nature as representations of US influence in Libya.   —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: True   —   —   Trump says: ”America is far less safe  —   and the world is far less stable  —   than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy. . .. I am certain it is a decision that President Obama truly regrets.” In fact: Parts of the world, in particular the Middle East, are indeed much less stable in many ways than before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. However, the secretary of state merely carries out the foreign policy directives of the president, and doesn’t make substantive foreign policy decisions without the consent of the president. Further, the fact that Obama is now actively campaigning on behalf of Hillary Clinton strongly suggests he does not particularly regret the way she performed when she was his secretary of state.  —  Jennifer Williams  Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,   ISIS was not even on the map.”    In fact: The group named ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) did not formally exist under that name until 2013; however, it was formed out of the remnants of   in Iraq, which dates back to 2004. So this is a little misleading. Following the US troop surge in Iraq in 2007, the group was largely defeated. But around 2011, as US troops began to withdraw from Iraq (under an agreement reached during the Bush administration) and as the civil war next door in Syria got underway, the group took advantage of the chaos to regroup and began launching attacks. In 2013, the group changed its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and in June 2014 it launched   operations in Iraq, capturing large swaths of that country.  —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,     …     Libya was stable.” In fact: The 2011 intervention in Libya that deposed longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi left behind a failed state in which   militants were able to grow in power and strength. Qaddafi was overthrown with US support because he was massacring his own people in response to Arab Spring —  related uprisings in Libya. However, it is true that during the George W. Bush administration,   relations had undergone a dramatic improvement. In 2003, Qaddafi made a ”historic decision” to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction and renounce terrorism, and in 2006 the US restored full diplomatic relations with Libya.  —  Jennifer Williams    Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,     …     Egypt was peaceful.” In fact: The Egyptian revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak and ushered in an era of political upheaval and instability in Egypt that persists to this day occurred in 2011. However, in the years leading up to that, Egypt had experienced periodic eruptions of political violence, including protests, strikes, and riots  —   as well as severe political repression at the hands of the regime  —   but overall the country was generally more stable and less violent than it is today (though most of the violence in Egypt today comes from the military regime of Abdel Fattah  ). And even after the 2011 revolution, including during the period when the Muslim Brotherhood —  backed Mohamed Morsi was in charge of the country, Egypt maintained its peace treaty with Israel.  —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,     …     Iraq was seeing really a reduction in violence.” In fact: As Brookings’s Ken Pollack has documented:  By early 2009, Iraq was still a long way from stability, tranquility, prosperity or true democracy.   …     But in a relative sense, it had made enormous progress. It was finally headed in the right direction. And it had taken some remarkable steps forward, steps that had seemed impossible even a few years before. In 2009 Iraq held provincial elections, and in 2010 national elections, that resulted in stunning victories for those parties considered the most secular, the most vested in improving governance and services, the least tied to the militias and the least sectarian.  Iraq’s slide back into   chaos began in 2010, when US troops, under an agreement reached by the Bush administration with former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri   began withdrawing from the country in significant numbers.   —  Jennifer Williams  Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,     …     Iran was being choked by sanctions.” In fact: For years before the historic nuclear deal reached with Iran in 2015, the country was under harsh sanctions that had crippled its economy. The overall point of the sanctions, however, was to bring Iran to the negotiating table on its nuclear program. Now that a deal has been reached, the sanctions that were specifically applied because of its nuclear activities are being removed. However, Iran remains under sanctions for other activities unrelated to its nuclear program, such as its support for terrorist organizations.   —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”In 2009,     …     Syria was under control.” In fact: Before the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, Syria  —   like Egypt and Libya  —   was largely stable and under control. However, also like Egypt and Libya, that control was at the hands of a brutally repressive dictator; in the case of Syria, that dictator was Bashar  . The uprising of 2011 plunged the country into chaos, mainly because of the actions of Assad himself, who, rather than leave power, chose to launch a   war against his own people.  —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons.” In fact: According to experts such as Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Iran is basically complying with the core parts of the nuclear agreement  —   such as limiting the number of centrifuges it has and eliminating its stockpile of highly enriched uranium that could quickly be converted to   material  —   that make it harder for the country to make a nuclear weapon. There is no evidence that Iran is currently pursuing a nuclear weapon in contravention of the deal’s terms.  —  Zack Beauchamp  Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost.” In fact: The US does pay the most toward NATO’s budget. That is in large part because the share each country is expected to pay is calculated according to each country’s gross national income. The US gross national income is higher, so it pays a bigger share. Makes sense. However, as Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post reported, NATO documents clearly state that ”[t]he volume of the US defense expenditure effectively represents 73 per cent of the defense spending of the Alliance as a whole” and that ”there is an   by the Alliance as a whole on the United States for the provision of essential capabilities, including for instance, in regard to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance;    refueling; ballistic missile defense; and airborne electronic warfare.” Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”And when a secretary of state illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33, 000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime. ..” In fact: The claim that Clinton ”illegally” stored her emails has no merit, according to FBI Director James Comey. After an investigation that lasted nearly a year, Comey said he found no evidence that Clinton intentionally broke the law. Second, when Trump claims Clinton deleted 33, 000 emails to cover up a crime, he’s leaving out one key fact: According to Clinton, these were personal emails stored on her private server. And she had no obligation to turn personal emails over to the government. Meanwhile, Clinton says she turned over all the   emails  —   about 30, 000 of them  —   that her team managed to find. This wasn’t a full inventory: Comey’s investigation recovered ”several thousand” additional   emails that weren’t turned over. But, Comey said: ”We found no evidence that any of the additional     were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.”  —  Andrew Prokop  Ruling: Misleading  —   —    Trump says: ”When the FBI director says that the secretary of state was ’extremely careless’ and ’negligent’ in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did.” In fact: FBI Director Comey did indeed use those terms, but Trump’s assertion that what Clinton ”actually did” was far worse is utterly baseless  —   an unsupported smear. Comey testified to Congress that the FBI’s ”best information” indicated that Clinton used the private server ”for convenience,” rather than for any nefarious purpose.  —  Andrew Prokop Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”  …    that same secretary of state rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers.” In fact: This refers to a number of reports, including one from the Washington Post, that found ”[t]he Clinton Foundation accepted millions of dollars from seven foreign governments during Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state.” But no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either Hillary Clinton or the foundation itself has been found to date, and even Peter Schweizer, the author of a book aimed at exposing the Clinton Foundation’s faults, admits as much. So the bottom line is that there were definitely ethical lines that were crossed, but it is also the case that the money that went to the foundation was ostensibly used for disaster relief and other humanitarian efforts, not for enriching the personal wealth of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  —  Jennifer Williams Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”Immediately after Dallas, we’ve seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan, and Tennessee. On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very, very badly injured.” In fact: Trump is right that police officers have faced continued threats while doing their jobs. But this has always been true. And, as noted above, the Officer Down Memorial Page tracker shows   deaths of police officers are near historic lows  —   despite an increase in gunfire deaths, but a drop in overall deaths, in 2016.  —  German Lopez Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”My opponent has called for a radical 550 percent increase . .. in Syrian refugees on top of the existing massive refugee flows coming in already under the leadership of President Obama.” In fact: The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting 10, 000 Syrian refugees into the US in fiscal year 2016. They’re not exactly on pace to meet that goal  —   as of the end of June (  of the way through the fiscal year) the US had admitted about 5, 200 Syrian refugees. Meanwhile, many Democrats and advocacy groups have called for the US to take 50 percent of the Syrian refugees approved for resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  —   which amounts to 65, 000. Hillary Clinton has endorsed that idea, hence the 550 percent increase. That said, given that the United States only takes about 80, 000 refugees a year total from around the world, it’s unlikely that Clinton could hit this target. Also note that even Clinton’s expanded target pales in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in many European countries and the   Syrian refugees in Turkey. Historically, the US has been a leader in taking refugees: it’s generally taken half of all refugees resettled around the world.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: Mostly true  —   —    Trump says: ”There’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.” In fact: It takes approximately two years to approve a refugee to settle in the US. Most of that time is spent screening the refugee. The process for screening Syrian refugees is so stringent (for example, a refugee who’d once given ”a sandwich or a cigarette” to a Syrian rebel soldier would have been banned until last year) that the government rarely let in any before fall 2015. And it’s still not on pace to meet its goal of admitting 10, 000 refugees this year because it’s being so careful with the screening process.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for   and Latino workers.” In fact: There is some research indicating that inflows of unskilled immigrants reduces wages specifically for   high school dropouts (other research disputes this) but immigration raises incomes for the large majority of Americans who have a high school degree.  —  Matt Yglesias Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ” Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more . .. than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf.” In fact: At least one of the families Trump names who have lost a child to an unauthorized immigrant  —   Jamiel and Anita Shaw  —   have been involved in   advocacy since before Trump teased his last presidential run. They’ve been supported by the advocacy group the Federation for American Immigration Reform since at least 2008; Jamiel Shaw testified before Congress in February 2015, months before Trump announced his run. This seems like a silly nit to pick, but it’s important because getting in touch with these families is how Trump realized the issue of unauthorized immigration was so powerful last summer. They organized him, not the other way around. Trump has relatively deep ties to the people (like Sen. Jeff Sessions) who’ve spoken the loudest against legal and unauthorized immigration; he’s not giving voice to an unheard perspective, just one that neither party’s establishment has recently embraced.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”By ending catch and release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won’t be happening very much anymore. Peace will be restored.” In fact: Illegal border crossings are already extremely low. They’re not at zero, but they’re historically low. And while the Mexico side of the   border is pretty violent, the US side of the border is already very peaceful. El Paso, Texas, is one of the safest cities in the US. There’s no peace to restore there. It’s also not clear what Trump is promising to do, exactly. The policy referred to as ”catch and release” was ended in 2006, when the US started prosecuting immigrants en masse in criminal court for illegal entry and illegal reentry (swamping the courts in the process). Some border agents (including the union, which has endorsed Trump) allege that the administration has started it again by telling border patrol agents not to arrest unauthorized immigrants who aren’t ”priorities”  —   but the ”priorities” include anyone who’s entered the US after 2014, so, by definition, it wouldn’t stop agents from catching people crossing the border.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: Baseless  —   —    Trump says: ”Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.” In fact: ”Mass lawlessness” implies that Clinton wants millions of unauthorized immigrants in the US. But the premise of her ”comprehensive immigration reform” is that  —   with the current unauthorized population legalized, enforcement strengthened, and legal immigration revamped to meet demand  —   illegal immigration would stop being a problem. Trump might not believe that’s what would happen, but it’s certainly what Clinton and other CIR supporters are proposing.  —  Dara Lind Ruling: Disputed  —   —   Trump says: ”America has lost nearly   of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.” In fact: It’s true that manufacturing employment has declined by about a third since 1997, though it’s worth emphasizing that manufacturing output is currently at an   high. The choice of base year here is also a bit odd. NAFTA was enacted in 1994, and permanent normal trade relations with China came into effect in 2001. Nothing noteworthy in trade policy happened in 1997, which just happened to be the   peak year for US manufacturing employment.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: Mostly true  —   —   Trump says: ”My opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization  —   another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes and disasters. She supported the   trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the   Partnership.” In fact: Bill Clinton signed NAFTA and legislation paving the way for China’s entrance into the WTO. Hillary wasn’t an elected official at the time, but she made favorable comments about NAFTA during his administration. Clinton criticized the South Korea trade agreement on the campaign trail in 2007, but supported a later version of the agreement as secretary of state in 2011. She said the   Partnership ”sets the gold standard in trade agreements” as secretary of state in 2012 but became an opponent of the TPP on the campaign trail in 2015.  —  Timothy B. Lee Ruling: Mostly true  —   —   Trump says: ”[The TPP] will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments.” In fact: The US manufacturing sector is in no danger of being destroyed  —   in fact, US factories are producing more goods than ever. However, employment in manufacturing has been falling for three decades, in part due to competition from   countries. The TPP would lower trade barriers with about a dozen countries, including   Vietnam and Malaysia, most notably in the textile industry, so it could mean job losses in that sector of the economy. However, US trade barriers are already quite low, and the TPP would also open up new markets  —   especially Japan  —   for exports. So the overall impact on manufacturing employment is likely to be modest. The TPP won’t make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments directly, but it will make US trade policy subject to the rulings of dispute settlement panels.  —  Timothy B. Lee Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year  —   Democrat or Republican.” In fact: It’s true that Trump’s tax cuts would cost more than those of any other candidate, at $11. 2 trillion over 10 years, compared with $10. 2 trillion for Ted Cruz and $8. 2 trillion for Marco Rubio. He also proposes the biggest tax cuts for the median taxpayer. The middle quintile would get back $2, 732 on average, compared with $1, 365 for Rubio, $1, 783 for Cruz, and $1, 464 for Jeb Bush. This is all assuming that Trump pays for the whole tax plan through deficit spending. If he tries to cut spending instead, then he’ll necessarily have to cut into programs that help the poor and middle class, and quite possibly leave typical Americans worse off than they were before. Whether or not Clinton’s plan is a ”massive” increase is a matter of opinion; the Tax Policy Center estimates the middle quintile will pay $44 a year more under her proposals.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: True  —   —   Trump says: ”America is one of the   nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country.” In fact: Among rich countries, America is one of the   nations in the world. According to OECD statistics, total taxes in the US  —   including federal, state, and local  —   totaled 26 percent in 2014, the last year on record. Only South Korea and Chile were less taxed among wealthier nations. For comparison, taxes made up 51 percent of Danish GDP, 45 percent of French GDP, 36 percent of German GDP, 33 percent of UK GDP, and 31 percent of Canadian GDP. Trump’s associated claim that cutting US taxes would create jobs is heavily disputed among economists, but at least there’s an argument there.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year.” In fact: This number comes from a disputed study by the National Association of Manufacturers that relies on surveys of business leaders. Similar surveys have been criticized by the Congressional Research Service for relying on businesses’ vague ”perception” of costs to reach high numbers. More to the point, though, this study doesn’t include any benefits of these regulations (such as, for instance, lower pollution and cleaner air). Failing to include benefits gives a misleading picture here.  —  Brad Plumer Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in   economic activity over the next four decades.” In fact: As president, Trump could relax various restrictions on oil and gas drilling that Obama has put in place on federal lands. But adding $500 billion a year to GDP via these actions would be incredibly difficult. That number comes from a paper by the Institute for Energy Research, which envisions a scenario in which all federal lands currently off limits to oil and gas production are opened up and companies start drilling. This scenario is far from assured. It would require states like California to agree to open up protected coasts, which seems unlikely. More importantly, if oil prices remain at their current low levels, it’s doubtful that companies would choose to go drill in many of these areas, many of which are costly and technically challenging (such as the   waters of the Gulf of Mexico). David Victor, an energy expert at the University of California San Diego, has called Trump’s $20 trillion number ”a fantasy” and ”off by an order of magnitude.”  —  Brad Plumer Ruling: Disputed  —   —   Trump says: ”My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steelworkers of our country out of work  —   that will never happen when I am president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.” In fact: Hillary Clinton’s climate plan would very likely lead to a shrinkage of the coal industry  —   putting coal miners out of work. But miners would also very likely continue to go out of work even under a President Trump, because the coal industry is being crushed right now by cheap natural gas, collapsing demand from China, and other forces that Trump would have no control over.  —  Brad Plumer Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again.” In fact: It is true that Donald Trump does want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But his replacement plan will, according to an analysis from the Committee on a Responsible Fiscal Budget, cause 21 million people to lose coverage. Not being able to afford a doctor is pretty functionally similar, if not worse, than being able to choose one. One of the assumptions implicit in Trump’s statement is that right now, it’s particularly hard to see a doctor of one’s choice. But the data doesn’t back that up: A recent survey of Americans with health insurance finds that 87 percent are satisfied with their choice of doctors.  —  Sarah Kliff Ruling: Misleading  —   —   Trump says: ”My opponent dismissed the VA scandal  —   one more sign of how out of touch she really is.” In fact: Clinton indeed said something to this effect, telling MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow: ”It’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be.   …     Now nobody would believe that from the coverage you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have.” Her campaign later backtracked. That being said, Clinton was basically correct: The claims of VA ineptitude have been wildly overblown for ideological reasons, and the VA still offers some of the, and in some areas the, best health care available in the United States.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: True  —   —    Trump says: ”My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.” In fact: Clinton wants additional gun control regulation but told This Week’s George Stephanopoulos, ”I believe we can have commonsense gun safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment” and has at no point called for the amendment’s repeal.  —  Dylan Matthews Ruling: False  —   —   Trump says: ”An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their   status if they openly advocate their political views.” In fact: In 1954, Johnson did introduce an amendment preventing   organizations from endorsing or opposing candidates for elected political office  —   and that technically applies to churches too. (Note, though, that Johnson wasn’t really focused on churches when he passed the amendment, as Purdue University sociology professor James D. Davidson explains in Why Churches Cannot Endorse or Oppose Political Candidates. He was trying to slow the spread of McCarthyism.)  —  Tara Golshan Ruling: True     "
" I didn’t leave the theater after seeing Hamilton. I resurfaced.    Walking out into the cool night air, pushing past the people crowded near the stage door to catch even a glimpse of the show’s cast as they exited, I felt as if I had been sitting on the floor of the ocean and needed to take my time breaking the water’s surface, lest my body depressurize. It’s an experience I’ve had a few times in my life, always in the presence of great art. I remember staying up well past bedtime as a teenager reading The Great Gatsby, then having to get out of bed and march around my room, because reality felt inadequate. I remember seeing The Tree of Life and feeling so overwhelmed that when my wife asked me an innocent question a   later, I nearly bit her head off. It was as if I had forgotten what planet I lived on.  Related  How   Miranda taught liberals to love Alexander Hamilton    And now here I was again, learning to breathe air once more, after so much time on someone else’s oxygen.    I don’t know if I had hoped Hamilton would disappoint me, or not live up to the hype. More likely than not, I just hoped I would have a good time. Instead, in its immediate wake, it wasn’t just reality that felt inadequate; I felt inadequate.    My wife and I were already late to meet friends for dinner, so we hurried down the street, past the throngs, and I could feel the evening dissipating, evaporating off my skin. The comedown is always the worst part. And then, later, when I couldn’t sleep, my thoughts of Hamilton would drift elsewhere, to a man I’d never met and could never begin to comprehend.     Current Affairs recently published an article that signals, I think, the real beginning of the Hamilton backlash, which has been in its incipient stages for a few months now, if only because everybody I know who’s sick of hearing about Hamilton shared it, even though it’s terrible criticism. Called ”You Should Be Terrified That People Who Like Hamilton Run Our Country,” the piece is by Alex Nichols. He dislikes Hamilton’s refusal to talk about slavery, because the Founding Fathers the musical talks about didn’t really deal with slavery either. At its core, Nichols’s piece worries that by turning the Founding Fathers into   ”cool” characters, the center of a   musical that rewrites the founding of the country to star people of color, Hamilton is trying to sweep America’s sins under the rug. (Nichols uses this to draw a connection between President Obama’s love of Hamilton and his love of drone warfare, which. ..) But this fundamentally misunderstands everything Hamilton is trying to do. It isn’t a celebration of the Founding Fathers. It’s barely even a demystification of them (though that’s closer to the mark).    Hamilton is about how after our deaths, we are all reduced to stories our survivors tell each other No, Hamilton agrees with Nichols more than he thinks. It’s not a work that tries to excuse Alexander Hamilton’s failure to do anything substantive about slavery. At times, it even loathes the title character. Instead, it’s a story about how inadequately we are all preserved by history, about how after our deaths, we are all reduced to stories our survivors tell each other. As such, Hamilton is mystified by its own characters. It turns over its final   to Eliza Schuyler, Hamilton’s wife and a supporting character who, by virtue of outliving everybody else in the cast, left behind more of a record of her life than the other characters did. It wants to stick to history, more or less, but it conflates events and fudges things to make a better story. It’s not an accurate record of these people’s lives. It’s a rumination. So Hamilton is a mystery. In its first song (”Alexander Hamilton”) in its first lines, no less, it asks a question:  How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot In the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?  But the show never really answers that question. It tries, but it’s cut off by the dark mist that surrounds the past.    Hamilton writer   Miranda (who originally played the title character) takes his best guess just a couple of songs later, in ”My Shot,” the show’s centerpiece. The music drops out, and Hamilton offers up a soliloquy.  I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory When’s it gonna get me? In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me? If I see it comin’ do I run or do I let it be? Is it like a beat without a melody? See, I never thought I’d live past 20 Where I come from some get half as many  Hamilton isn’t a Founding Father, then. He’s a survivor, surprised to have escaped death and convinced someone will come to even the score. Eventually, he’s proved right.  The facts of my biological father’s life that I actually know are few. He was 48 when he died in 2006. He had been married, and he raised two children. He liked Dr. Pepper. He looked like me, a little bit, but skinnier and more athletic in his build. Beyond that, what I know are fragments of pieces of memories, skewed by the tellers. This is not to say that they are tainted consciously by agenda, or even that they are somehow prejudiced against him. It’s just to say that we all have our biases, and if Hamilton knows anything, it’s that once somebody dies, we immediately begin to write competing versions of their life story. Yet every story of my father’s life suggest a great power of reinvention. His parents were immigrants, and his two older siblings were both born overseas. He alone was a   American citizen, born in Indiana, then growing up in Michigan.    He never stopped churning. The slim biography I had of him from my adoption agency said that he had been pursuing a medical degree, so I was surprised to learn that he had, instead, worked for a computer company up until his death. When one career didn’t work out, he simply reinvented himself into another one. His biography was filled with moments like this. A recovery from an auto accident led to him recuperating in his parents’ basement (a time period that coincided with my conception). He slipped ably between his parents’ mother tongue and English. He lived so often between two worlds.           Hamilton’s Phillipa Soo, Renee Elise Goldsberry, and Jasmine Cephas Jones perform onstage during the 2016 Tony Awards. (Theo   Images for Tony Awards Productions) His family was struck by tragedy after tragedy, even before his death. Death visited members at far too young an age, and right when things would seem to be back on track, they would slip right off again. There were good times as well, but when you look at the river, you don’t always see the scenery when there are rapids. When I finally met his mother and became somewhat close to her in the last years of her life, though, she saw no scenery, only rapids. My birth, to a woman she would never know, and adoption, to parents she would never know, were foundational tragedies to my grandmother, to the point that when I protested I’d had, all things considered, a really great life with my adopted parents, she angrily told me things would have been better had I stayed. And then she dropped the shoe that had been hanging over my life without me knowing it. My father, see, had tried to gain parental rights after finding out I existed. It took extensive   for him to finally sign the papers consenting to my adoption. He wanted to reinvent himself into a father, and everybody around him was pretty sure he could do it. Why not? He had done everything else.    But he was 20. My mother was 19. Finally he signed the papers, and the course of my life was set.  You will hear different answers to the question of what the best song is in Hamilton, but the answer is, unquestionably, ”Satisfied,” a song performed by Angelica Schuyler, Hamilton’s   . In short, ”Satisfied” replays the events of an earlier song, ”Helpless,” (complete with a short sequence where the entire show is rewound via staging and choreography) from Angelica’s perspective, granting deeper meaning to her introduction of her sister Eliza to Hamilton, Eliza’s eventual husband. It lands around the midpoint of the first act, is structured around an incredibly ambitious flashback gambit, and almost certainly won Renee Elise Goldsberry (the woman who sings it) a Tony. It’s also, like Hamilton as a whole, a story about stories. It’s a piece where everybody has a point of view, and where history will be written not necessarily by the winners, but by those who live longest (in this case, Eliza) and write sweetest. Hamilton’s narrator, Aaron Burr, after all, wins the duel that kills Hamilton, but history mostly records him as a villain. The song shows Angelica giving a toast at her sister’s wedding to Hamilton, and in doing so explores a fictional invention: that Angelica loved Hamilton first  —   was, indeed, probably his soul mate  —   but for reasons of societal propriety, she was obliged to fix him up with her sister instead. The question I get asked often is, ”If you knew your father’s name, why didn’t you find him before he died?”    This song shows the audience just how committed the enterprise is to the idea of storytelling as a method for organizing lives and political movements. ”Satisfied” is told from the point of view of an Angelica who seems significantly older than the one who’s giving a toast at Eliza and Hamilton’s wedding, as if an omniscient Angelica, on her death bed, dropped in from out of nowhere to offer her younger self a quick look at the moment when it all turned wrong. The thing is, even though Angelica contrives to keep Hamilton in her family, she spends very little time with him after his marriage to Eliza. The story of the night when she might have won his heart, might have had him to herself, then, becomes a kind of foundational document of who she is, an   constitution. Hamilton is about stories, yes, but also the singular moments that spawn them, the turning points when everything might have gone differently. It’s almost entirely fictional  —   Angelica was married when she met Hamilton  —   but it’s one that gets at the core of Hamilton’s thematic obsessions. Death traps us in our life stories as told by others. The stories of women and people of color have largely been written out of history, unfairly. And there is always a moment when it all went wrong, when things might have otherwise been rewritten to turn toward light. After all, what is a country’s foundation but the foundational tragedies of all of its citizens, butting up against each other in conflict?  Hamilton shouldn’t work. I don’t really mean this on a thematic level or a storytelling level or anything like that, though it must have been murderously difficult to pull off. No, I mean that   and musical theater shouldn’t mesh as well as they do in Hamilton.    At the core of   is verbal dexterity and cleverness. It’s a medium about how many rhymes can be squeezed into the same line but also about how clever those rhymes can be. Musical theater, meanwhile, is largely about guiding the listener’s ear through the lyrics, the better to tell a story or express character development, or what have you. Hamilton is caught between twin pressures: It can be authentic   and create a bewildering experience for those who go to the theater without having heard the cast recording, or it can provide a more pure musical theater experience and sound like    . The show splits the difference. There’s nothing in here that would sound wildly innovative to a seasoned   fan, and the rapping in the show (as star Daveed Diggs pointed out) is actually somewhat ”slow” in the overall scheme of things. But it manages to sound more like   than musical theater is supposed to. Miranda achieves this in three ways. The first is that he bulldozes ahead and creates the show he wants to create. If you enter the theater cold, the lyrics are too dense to catch everything that happens and every reference that floats by. The second borrows from the traditions of musical theater. Every major character has a musical theme, even if it’s just a snippet, and Miranda repeats them often enough that you’ll understand the story on an emotional wavelength, even if you don’t catch every lyric. What’s important to every character resurfaces constantly, and Miranda makes sure to give them all centerpiece songs that slow the action down just enough to convey their heart’s desires.

But they’re also structured in such a way that you can follow the plot almost entirely by hearing the words more than two or three people sing together. When the entire chorus enters together, Miranda structures his meter so certain words  —   certain     words  —   land on the beat and naturally receive the most emphasis from both performers and listeners.    It’s a neat trick, ensuring that even if the only word you pick up is, say, ”Ships!” you’re aware that there are ships out there on the harbor somewhere. Listen to the full score, and you’ll pick up all the nuance. But see the show cold, and you can still follow the plot, while catching maybe half of what’s said and still enjoying the performances and direction. This is what I mean when I say that Hamilton is bottomless. Even on a structural level, when you go poking around in its depths, you keep finding new gems to pull out and examine. It’s not perfect. I can, if I really want to, pick at its flaws and start to unravel it (and I’ll try in a bit). But it’s perfect, in that way art can be. After I saw it, I could barely write for a month.  The question I get asked often is, ”If you knew your father’s name, why didn’t you find him before he died?” The answer I usually give is, ”He had a common name.” And he did! When I would search for it, dozens of different people in his rough age range would pop up around the country. The address he had left with the adoption agency was for the apartment he held as a    for a building that (so far as I can tell) no longer exists. I was in my 20s and figured I had time. It was just easier to let it slide. But the real answer, the one I struggle to share, is that after what my biological mother told me about him, I didn’t want to meet him.    The facts are these: One chilly February night, she and he were at the restaurant where they both worked. They were friendly with each other, so they had a few drinks. Things led to each other, as they will, and they slept together. Enter me. Except even here I’m eliding, which is to say that when my mother told me this story, she qualified it by saying she didn’t want to say she was raped, but she was so drunk she didn’t know what she was doing and certainly didn’t want to do that. ”He took advantage of me,” she finally said, after much hemming and hawing. There is immense value in greatness, yes, but in the end, Hamilton says, there is even more value in goodness That was when I first met her, all the way back in 2000, a time when the words ”enthusiastic consent” weren’t in the mainstream consciousness, when I heard about a friend sleeping with a drunk girl who’d passed out in his bed and didn’t immediately think of him as a rapist but, rather, as just kind of an asshole. Certainly the moral code I grew up with didn’t allow for ”taking advantage” of someone, but it also didn’t label such a thing ”rape.” That was for dark alleys and horrible, violent moments. Now I like to imagine that I know ”more,” whatever that means, that I know how important consent is. I like to think I’m on the ”right side” of these issues, again, whatever that means. But I still would never, ever call my father a rapist. I hesitate to even type it now, in the negative.    I have excuses, of course, maybe even good ones. I never got his side of the story. Both of them were really drunk and didn’t know what they were doing. It was a different time. They were both raised in cultures of religious repression, and cultures of religious repression can lead to   sexual experiences. And, most importantly, my mother herself doesn’t define what happened that night in that way, and it would be wrong for me to force an interpretation of those events on the one person alive who was actually there. But really, it’s just easier to say ”drunken   stand.” ”Drunken   stand” doesn’t invite questions. It doesn’t impugn the dead. It doesn’t label the living with unnecessary shame. It also lets me continue to imagine my father as fundamentally good. Someone who made mistakes, yes, but don’t we all?  The last   of Hamilton has tremendous moments, but it also suddenly turns into ”Shit, We Forgot to Develop the Character of Eliza: The Musical.” It pivots into suggesting that Eliza was the true hero of the story, both for being a genuinely guileless and good person and for keeping her husband’s legacy alive when she had so many excuses to not do so. It’s awkward. It doesn’t mar the whole, but it was the one loose thread that kept nagging at me after seeing the show, like all those Lord of the Rings endings. Why didn’t the show end with the duel, when the two men at the story’s center were forever marked and changed? Why the   conclusion that comes out of nowhere?    The answer is surprisingly similar to the one I usually give for Lord of the Rings  —   the story that seemed like the most important one wasn’t actually the most important one. Eliza outlives everybody. She gets to cement the legacies of so many, and she works tirelessly to make the world a better place for as many people as possible. She builds an orphanage in her husband’s memory, for God’s sake. And that would make for kind of a crummy protagonist in a work of dramatic fiction, where we expect characters who are strivers, who are after something. But why does fiction insist the only thing worth going after is something impersonal and massive? Why is building a nation somehow more worthy than preserving a husband’s legacy?   Related  45 artists illustrated every song in Hamilton, and the results are stunning    Like Angelica and Hamilton, Eliza is never satisfied, but only in the sense that she sees the world as a template to be made better. She enters the story as a supporting character to her sister, becomes a supporting character to her husband, but exits it as the protagonist. If anyone’s model here is to be emulated, it’s hers. It’s the show’s biggest, most ambitious leap, one that’s hard to get on board with right away, but one that works better and better for me the more I think about it. And in a show about attempting to rewrite the country’s founding to include everyone, not just the white men who are usually at the story’s center, it’s quietly radical to end everything by talking about a woman whose achievements aren’t as distinctive but have proved  . Or maybe the answer is present from the first, from very nearly the first words Eliza speaks on stage, a simple phrase that the entire chorus picks up multiple times throughout the show: ”Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now.” We are, all of us, accidents, in a sense. The events that create us are terrifyingly random, and the paths of history that led to our existence are as unknowable to us as the paths that will stretch out from our own lives, into the distant future.    The characters in Hamilton tell stories and worry about legacies and hope for greatness, but Hamilton’s greatest gift in the end is that it reminds us that there is more to life than living the kind of life that gets a Broadway musical written about you centuries after your death. Kindness is important. Building a better world is important. Compassion is paramount. There is immense value in greatness, yes, but in the end, Hamilton says, there is even more value in goodness. It’s a hard message to argue, and it’s one Hamilton argues imperfectly. That it even tries, though, is, to me, worth all its frayed edges.  My father’s death caused me to spiral. Yes, I got to know his family. Yes, I learned more about why I am the way I am. But the simple fact that I had put off finding him, because I didn’t want to think about the inconvenient truths of my conception, left me  reeling. Which, indirectly, leads to the part where I couldn’t write for a month after seeing Hamilton. If there’s a place where I relate to Hamilton most, it’s in the fact that when your existence feels like an accident, it becomes tempting to assume that you are here for some greater purpose, some greater meaning, if only so you have some reason to justify yourself to yourself. Hamilton survived a hurricane and a forbidding environment. He saved himself by being such a good writer that others took up a collection to send him off to a better life. I can relate to this: Change any of a few tiny bits and pieces about that February night, and I’m not here, writing this. Change even my gender, and I’m adopted by an entirely different family, and who knows what’s next. But there’s more here, deeper to go. Indeed, if I had a friend who was pregnant at 19 and ambivalent about the conception, the father, all of it, I would surely remind her abortion was an option open to her. And in that moment, I might wonder if I were recommending she abort myself. When your existence feels like an accident, it becomes tempting to assume that you are here for some greater purpose It certainly doesn’t help that I spent most of my childhood being told abortion was the single worst holocaust in human history  —   millions of human beings killed, before they could even become human beings. I support abortion rights, but a tiny part of me can’t stop believing that I made it through to the other side of my own gauntlet, that I have survived where so many others perished. Which is   and fucked up and goes against everything I know to be true about the universe, but when I hear Miranda’s version of Hamilton say, ”I imagine death so much it feels like a memory,” it’s like meeting an old friend. I, too, have survivor’s guilt, no matter how unnecessary. After my father’s death, I found myself increasingly dissatisfied with a boring newspaper job I was never that committed to in the first place. Wasn’t I supposed to be writing and not editing? Wasn’t I charged with purpose? So I quit. And I nearly wrecked my marriage, my life, my bank account  —   all of it. (Okay, I actually did wreck my bank account.) But then I started writing about TV, mostly as a lark, until people started paying me, and I ended up here. It seemed like a good idea at the time. But have I written anything that will last, anything that will leave a mark? No. Hamilton will be listened to on starships making their way across endless inky space. I don’t think the residents of the future will care nearly so much about Glee recaps. Miranda is only a few months older than me, and where he had invented something deeply profound, I had mostly frittered away my time on the impermanent. I wasn’t a failure, not precisely. I was more of a waste  —   an accident who failed to justify himself. It was hard to write about Game of Thrones after that.  Hamilton isn’t just a story about stories; it’s also a show where the characters are constantly telling you what to think about them, then immediately being misinterpreted by the others around them. Though it develops more than a   major characters, it keeps returning to Hamilton and Burr, because they best represent this idea in miniature. By the end, they literally can’t understand each other  —   even though they’re in many respects the same person. All around us, people are trying to tell us what their story is, and we’re doubting their sincerity, because we have our own agendas. This habit calcifies with time, with age. We meet someone in our youth and have a   and where we should be able to better understand their point of view with age and wisdom, we instead become convinced we know them better than they do. What Hamilton understands in the end is that it’s not what you do with your life that matters, but who’s left to tell your story. (And I mean literally in the end. The last song is called ”Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story. ”) It doesn’t matter what you do on this planet, what kind of mark you leave, if those who memorialize you missed the point.           Leslie Odom Jr. and   Miranda, who play Burr and Hamilton, respectively. (Bruce    ) And everybody will miss the point. In that final song, Eliza, sings about how she tried to preserve her husband’s legacy  —   but until Hamilton, he was probably still best known for dying in a duel, which likely wouldn’t be his choice for a legacy. (    Hamilton legacies: ”He’s on the $10 bill,” and, ”Something with the treasury, I think? ”) Or look at my father. Every story I hear about him is different. He could reinvent himself, yes, but maybe he reinvented himself too many times. Maybe he could never find the center he needed, the thing that would let him slow down for a moment. (I can relate.) Maybe he was a very good man and a good dad. Maybe he did something horrible one night. Maybe he was every story I’ve heard about him, and others I will never hear. We like to think we define who we are, but we are also what others think about us  —   no matter how inaccurate. Their truths are our story as much as our own are, and maybe more so.  As I left the theater the night I saw Hamilton, feeling grossly inadequate and very small, and yet excited and thrilled to have lived in someone else’s atmosphere for a while, I kept thinking back to a favorite passage, from Norwegian writer Per Petterson’s novel I Curse the River of Time:  I was scared. Not of being dead, that I could not comprehend, to be nothing was impossible to grasp and therefore nothing really to be scared of, but the dying itself I could comprehend, the very instant when you know that now comes what you have always feared, and you suddenly realise that every chance of being the person you really wanted to be, is gone for ever, and the one you were, is the one those around you will remember.  We are all collections of facts: Burr did not have to shoot Hamilton, but he did. Hamilton’s wife Eliza did not have to fight for her husband’s legacy, but she did. My mother did not have to give birth to me, but she did. My father did not have to sign the adoption papers, but he did. My father died a hero to some, a villain to others, and a mystery to me. It is easy to look to him, to look to the moment of my conception, and hope for an answer that makes sense of myself. But does it matter? Or does it matter more that I’ve gotten to know my father through those who knew him? A reflection, after all, is still a remnant of the whole, and if you get enough reflections, you might be able to reconstruct something. It won’t be perfect, but it will be something. Who did my father want to be? It matters less than who he was, the person that others remember. He is a question mark to me, but I, too, was a question mark to him. He signed the papers, and that was it. And he died with the not knowing. As we all do. So, to whatever plane he is on, I can say that it turned out fine. She gave birth to me, and loved me enough to know that I would be better off elsewhere. I went to a town in South Dakota, a place at once too vast and too small, and somewhere along the line, I met a girl and married her, and then I drove until an ocean stopped me, and I convinced people to pay me money to write about television, which is not a thing everybody can do, and I saw a musical, of all things, in 2016, and that night in bed, when I couldn’t sleep, I thought of Hamilton, and I thought of him. "
" When you put together everything we know about Donald Trump, it’s terrifying.    Over the past year and a half, there has been a lot of reporting done on what’s perhaps the biggest question of the 2016 presidential campaign: Who is Trump? What we’ve learned should not give anyone much comfort. This is a man who’s just one election away from becoming the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Yet he’s also someone who has time and time again proven to be corrupt, sexist, racist, and all sorts of other  . He has appeared in newspapers demanding the executions of accused men of color who turned out to be innocent. He’s been repeatedly sued for discrimination against people of color and women. He’s engaged in shady business practices that push and at times break the boundaries of the law. Trump also seems willing and even enthusiastic to bring all of these characteristics to the White House. He has built his campaign around a proposal to build a wall at the   border, based in large part on his belief that Mexican immigrants are “bringing crime” to the US. (Nope.) He has proposed policies that target people based on their nationality and religion. He has continued to insult women based on their looks on the campaign trail. And in the second presidential debate  —   on national television!  —   he threatened to put his political opponent, Hillary Clinton, in jail if he becomes president.    Many people have called this behavior shocking. But when you get to know Trump, this behavior isn’t really shocking; it’s entirely in character. By and large, Trump’s campaign has merely reflected the very public figure Americans have known for decades  —   and that makes him all the scarier.    To really understand that, though, it’s useful to look back at Trump’s history of racism, sexism, and corruption. It’s a very long history. But it’s really worth reading and understanding in full. After all, Trump could be the next president of the United States. Trump has a long history of racism and bigotry            The presidential campaign is far from the first time Trump has faced accusations of racism. The very first time he appeared in the pages of the New York Times, back in the 1970s, was when the US Department of Justice sued him for racial discrimination. Since then, he has repeatedly appeared in newspaper pages across the world as his remarks and actions led to more similar controversies.    Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s long history, taken largely from Dara Lind’s list for Vox and an   by Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times:   1973: The US Department of Justice  —   under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations  —   sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to black tenants and lied to black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to discriminating before.  1980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, accused another of Trump’s businesses of discrimination. “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said. “It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back. ”  1988: In a commencement speech at Lehigh University, Trump spent much of his speech accusing countries like Japan of “stripping the United States of economic dignity. ” This matches much of his current rhetoric on China.  1989: In a controversial case that’s been characterized as a   lynching, four black teenagers and one Latino teenager  —   the “Central Park Five”  —   were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October said he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.  1991: A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.   …     I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control. ” Trump at first denied the remarks, but later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true. ”  1992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200, 000 fine because it transferred black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a   gambler’s prejudices.  2000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a “record of criminal activity [that] is well documented. ”  2004: In season two of The Apprentice, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a black contestant, for being overeducated. “You’re an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven’t done anything,” Trump said on the show. “At some point you have to say, ‘That’s enough. ’”  2005: Trump publicly pitched what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said he “wasn’t particularly happy” with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering “an idea that is fairly controversial  —   creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world. ”  2010: Just a few years ago, there was a huge national controversy over the “Ground Zero Mosque”  —   a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the   attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it “insensitive,” and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff. ”  2011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama  —   the country’s first black president  —   was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama’s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a “carnival barker. ”   2011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, “I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?”  And, of course, there’s what Trump has said and done over the past two years during his presidential campaign:  Trump launched his campaign calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” who are “bringing crime” and “bringing drugs” to the US. His campaign is largely built on building a wall to keep these immigrants out of the US. He called for a ban on all Muslims coming into the US. He has since expanded this ban to include anyone from specific countries, including possibly France and Germany. When asked at a Republican debate whether all 1. 6 billion Muslims hate the US, Trump said, “I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them. ” He argued that Judge Gonzalo Curiel  —   who’s overseeing the Trump University lawsuit —   should recuse himself from the case because of his Mexican heritage and membership in a Latino lawyers association. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who’s endorsed Trump, later called such comments “the textbook definition of a racist comment. ” Trump has been repeatedly slow to condemn white supremacists who endorse him, and he regularly retweets messages from white supremacists and  . He tweeted and later deleted an image that showed Hillary Clinton in front of a pile of money and by a Jewish Star of David that said, “Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!” The tweet had some very obvious   imagery, but Trump insisted that the star was a sheriff’s badge and said his campaign shouldn’t have deleted it. Trump has repeatedly referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has said she has Cherokee ancestors, as “Pocahontas. ” At the Republican convention, he officially seized the mantle of the “law and order” candidate  —   an obvious dog whistle playing to white fears of black crime, even though crime in the US is historically low. In a pitch to black voters, Trump said, “You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”  This long history is important. It would be one thing if Trump made just a few racist remarks. One, two, or even three of these types of comments might just show a bad speaker who’s seriously racially insensitive, not necessarily a   racist. Maybe even on the campaign trail, Trump is just a racial opportunist, saying things he doesn’t really believe to rile up voters.    But when you take all of his actions and comments together, a clear pattern emerges  —   one that suggests that bigotry is not just campaign opportunism on Trump’s part but a real element of his personality, character, and career that could guide how he governs as president. Trump has repeatedly insulted and objectified women over the decades            Trump’s scorn does not, however, stop at minority Americans. Over the decades, he has also repeatedly targeted individual women with nasty comments  —   mostly focused on their appearance. And he has been accused at least twice of sexual assault. Trump’s history became an enormous issue on the campaign trail in early October, when leaked audio from 2005 revealed Trump bragging that he can sexually assault women  —   “grab ’em by the pussy,” as he put it  —   thanks to his celebrity status. Vox has a running list of Trump’s remarks going back to 1988, adding up to 61 insults toward 39 women. He called comedian Rosie O’Donnell “a big fat pig,” “disgusting,” “a slob,” and “a very unattractive person. ” Bette Midler was “ugly. ” Heidi Klum is “no longer a 10. ” The individual insults, though, are just one facet of Trump’s broader attitude toward women. Anecdotes spanning decades make clear that Trump considers it his right to be surrounded by “beautiful” women. He has no boundaries about commenting on their appearance or sexuality. Twice before, he was accused of sexual assault, and he reportedly kissed women on the lips without their consent:   Jill Harth, who was meeting with Trump about promoting his beauty pageants in the early 1990s with her boyfriend, said Trump reached up her skirt and groped her at dinner, took her to Ivanka Trump’s bedroom and did the same, and continued pursuing her physically despite her protests. Harth filed a sexual harassment lawsuit in 1997 that she later withdrew, but her accusations have been consistent for nearly 20 years. (Trump claims Harth pursued him.)  Ivana Trump, Trump’s first wife, said in a divorce deposition that he raped her: Trump, according to the 1996 biography Lost Tycoon, pulled out Ivana’s hair, held back her arms, and penetrated her forcibly. (Ivana now says the story is “totally without merit” and was told at “a time of very high tension”; Trump’s lawyer refuted the allegations but also said that spousal rape is impossible, which is not true.) Temple Taggart told the New York Times that when she was 21 and Miss Utah, Trump kissed her “directly on the lips” the first time they met. (Trump was married at the time.) “I thought, ‘Oh my God, gross,’” she told the Times, saying there were “a few other girls” he treated the same way. (Trump disputes this.) In 2005, Trump told The Howard Stern Show that he made a habit of going into beauty pageant contestants’ dressing rooms even when they weren’t yet dressed: “No men are anywhere, and I’m allowed to go in, because I’m the owner of the pageant and therefore I’m inspecting it.   …     ‘Is everyone okay’? You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. ‘Is everybody okay?’ And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that,” he said, according to BuzzFeed.  Trump also has a long track record of discriminating against women in the workplace:     At the Trump Organization, he insisted that only the most attractive employees take lunch orders for visitors at a meeting, Barbara Res, a former construction executive, told the New York Times. “That was purely about looks,” Res told the newspaper. “He wanted the people in that room to think that all the women who worked for him were beautiful. ” During the same era, Trump kept an unflattering photograph of one employee that he called the “fat picture,” and would show it to the employee, Louise Sunshine, when she did something he didn’t like. He told Res, when she gained weight, that “you like your candy,” according to the New York Times. When Trump visited the Trump National Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, he’d demand that employees he found unattractive be fired, Matt Pearce reported for the Los Angeles Times. And Trump passed this attitude down throughout the organization. Two senior managers urged that overweight employees be let go because they weren’t attractive enough, and managers began scheduling the most beautiful women for shifts when Trump was visiting to avoid trouble. On set for The Apprentice, Trump talked about women’s breast sizes, discussed which contestants he’d want to sleep with, asked male contestants to rate the women based on their sexual desirability, and singled out a camera operator for special attention because he found her beautiful, according to Slate and the Associated Press. Whenever he could, Trump found a business excuse to surround himself with beautiful young women. He owned or   the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. He pitched a reality show called Lady and the Tramp, where, according to Variety, “girls in love with the party life will be sent to a charm school where they will receive a stern course on debutante manners. ” (Thankfully, it was never made.) After Trump tried, and failed, to get Nancy O’Dell to have sex with him  —   “I did try and fuck her. She was married,” he said on the leaked audio  —   he tried to replace her as host of the 2007 Miss USA pageant, according to Slate. O’Dell was pregnant at the time. Although Slate doesn’t draw a direct line between action and reaction, firing a woman for being pregnant is illegal. So is firing a woman because she refused to sleep with you.  Then there are the dozens of   comments Trump has made about women’s physical appearance on Twitter and in person. “It’s a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees,” he told a former Playboy playmate who had dramatically begged to stay on Celebrity Apprentice. He was a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show, going along with Stern’s questions about which women he’d want to have sex with. All of this speaks to another Trump characteristic: When Trump dislikes a woman, his instinct is to insult her physical appearance. When he likes one, he does the opposite, and immediately praises her beauty. He does this even if the context is odd or inappropriate, as when he made sure to note that the victim of a murder committed by an unauthorized immigrant was beautiful:   I absolutely support Kate’s Law —  in honor of the beautiful Kate Steinle who was gunned down in SF by an illegal immigrant. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2015    He memorialized his top aide of 26 years, a vice president within his company, by noting her looks first:   I have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant  Norma Foerderer. She passed away yesterday  —   a truly magnificent woman. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013    And, of course, when he wanted to praise Ivanka Trump, his intelligent, accomplished daughter, he did it by conferring his highest honor: He would date her. Trump is seemingly incapable of separating a woman’s value from her physical appearance. He assumes that his intimate commentary on women’s bodies is always welcome, no matter who might be listening  —   as the leaked audio, in which Trump is having a conversation with an acquaintance in a professional setting, demonstrates. He apparently never stops to consider how the women he’s subjecting to all of this might feel. In a professional setting, it’s degrading to know that people are paying more attention to your looks than your abilities or achievements. It’s gross for your boss to tell you you’re beautiful, or for a man with more power than you to speculate about what you’re like in bed. It’s dehumanizing to be reduced to a set of breasts and a pretty face.    Trump’s comments and actions routinely made the women who worked with and for him feel uncomfortable and unvalued. As Kristi Frank, a former contestant on The Apprentice whom Trump once referred to by miming a gesture for giant breasts, told the Associated Press: “I thought he noticed my hard work, but I guess he didn’t. ” “I thought he noticed my hard work, but I guess he didn’t”And, disturbingly, Trump seems to think all of this is welcomed. He wrote in his 2004 book How to Get Rich, “All the women on The Apprentice flirted with me  —   consciously or unconsciously. That’s to be expected. A sexual dynamic is always present between people, unless you are asexual. ” In other words: The women were asking for it. And Trump may have truly believed it. Harth, whom he allegedly assaulted, said Trump “genuinely seemed to assume sexual interest on her part,” Kristof wrote for the New York Times. Perhaps as a result, Trump has never tried to hide or apologize for his sexism. He hasn’t deleted his old tweets. He hasn’t made a big show of having a change of heart. It would have been easy to, for example, acknowledge that his remarks about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado’s weight gain were offensive and distasteful, say he’s gained perspective and humility from his bigger responsibilities as a politician rather than a pageant owner, and apologize. Instead, Trump tweeted accusations at her: “check out sex tape and past. ” (There is no sex tape.) To do otherwise would be to admit he was ashamed. And Trump is not ashamed. Trump justifies his remarks about women either as entertainment or as a blow against “political correctness”:      While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct. —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2012    All of this adds up to a gross  —   and potentially illegal  —   history of Trump’s time in charge of an international business, a beauty pageant, and a reality television show. But in the Oval Office, his disrespect for women could have even bigger consequences: Would federal appointments in a Trump administration go to the prettiest faces rather than the most able policy hands? Would Trump create a diplomatic incident by leering at foreign leaders or their wives? Would he use the power of the presidency to extort sexual favors from women too intimidated to say no? His track record suggests the answer to all of those questions could easily be yes. When Trump has power, he uses it to further empower and enrich himself            Beyond the accusations of racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry, we also know that Trump seems predisposed to abuse power when he obtains it. Whenever he has been in positions of power or authority, he has demonstrated a pattern of trying to enrich himself by abusing the trust others have placed in him  —   whether it’s creditors, contractors, charitable givers, Trump University students, regulators, or campaign donors. Over the past several months  —   and, indeed, the past few decades  —   reporters have unearthed many alarming stories that show this. They’ve reported on Trump’s many shady business practices. His shady charity. His shady fake university scam. His shady campaign spending. His many shady associates. And, last but by no means least, there is Trump’s refusal to release tax returns or other financial information that would shed further light on his business practices, associates, and philanthropic undertakings. Now, sometimes Trump’s abuses of trust entail breaking the law, and sometimes they’re within the bounds of the law. And sometimes the legality of Trump’s actions isn’t yet clear  —   as in the case of Trump University, which will face a fraud trial shortly after the election, and with some of the controversies around the Trump Foundation. Here are just a few examples  —   among the many that reporters have unearthed over the decades  —   of Trump’s tendency to corruption:    There are the hundreds of accusations that Trump refused to pay contractors and workers what they were owed, which the Wall Street Journal and USA Today compiled this year. “The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years,” Steve Reilly wrote for USA Today. “In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. ” (Trump told Reilly that if he ever didn’t pay, it must have been because he was unhappy with the work.)   True story   my Dad’s company was stiffed by Trump on a six figure telecom job in the 1980’s. Trump told them it would cost more to sue him. —   Brian Walsh (@brianjameswalsh) September 27, 2016     In 1986, Trump tried to take over two rival casino companies by buying up their stock. But the law required him to disclose his large purchases to the Federal Trade Commission in advance, and he failed to do so. The matter ended up in court, and he was eventually forced to pay a $750, 000 penalty as a result. Trump, like many other construction magnates from the 1970s and ’80s, has several connections to the mob. Michael Isikoff reported for Yahoo News that Trump worked very hard to keep reputed mobster Robert LiButti happy when he gambled at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, keeping women and black card dealers off LiButti’s table  —   which led to a $200, 000 fine for discrimination  —   and reportedly gifting LiButti nine luxury cars, exchanged for a total of $1. 65 million in cash. Other reporters have corroborated Trump’s connections to the mob. “I’ve covered Donald Trump off and on for 27 years, and in that time I’ve encountered multiple threads linking Trump to organized crime,” reporter David Cay Johnston wrote in Politico magazine. “No other candidate for the White House this year has anything close to Trump’s record of repeated social and business dealings with mobsters, swindlers, and other crooks. ” Trump has a charitable family foundation to which, in recent years, he has given hardly any money, instead raising the vast majority of its funds from others. That’s rather dishonest of him, since he constantly claims that the foundation’s donations are from his own pocketbook. But he’s also used foundation money in deeply questionable ways that may well have run afoul of laws against “ ” with charity money  —   from an illegal $25, 000 donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi around the time she was looking into investigating Trump University to the $258, 000 in foundation money Trump spent to settle legal issues regarding his businesses. Trump University advertised itself as teaching the secrets of real estate investment, but it was, apparently, a huge fraud  —   and it’s now facing lawsuits. Jason Nicholas, a former employee, said in one deposition, “They were teaching methods that were unethical, and they had had little to no experience flipping properties or doing real estate deals. It was a façade, a total lie. ” Another employee, Ronald Schnackenberg, said in another deposition, “To my knowledge, not a single consumer who paid for a Trump University seminar program went on to successfully invest in real estate based upon the techniques that were taught. ” As of August, the Trump campaign had allotted 7 percent of its total spending so far  —   more than $8. 2 million  —   to companies owned by Trump or his children, according to an analysis by Ken Vogel for Politico. Payments went to various Trump venues, an aviation company Trump owns, Trump Tower for office space, his corporate staff, and various other vendors. Now, Trump isn’t expected to provide this space for free  —   and his campaign points out he’s put $54 million of his own money into his run. Still, it sure looks like he’s trying to pad his business instead of using independent vendors. Shortly after the Trump campaign shifted from a largely   model to one more reliant on donors, Trump nearly quintupled the rent that Trump Tower was charging the campaign for office space, S. V. Dáte reported for the Huffington Post. This came at a time when the campaign didn’t expand its staff size, though Trump’s team later told CNN that they were paying for two new floors “in anticipation of more staff. ” Trump has surrounded himself with shady people throughout his campaign. Among those people is Trump surrogate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, whose administration is under investigation for causing a serious traffic jam in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in an act of political revenge against the town’s mayor. There’s also Trump adviser and former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who was pushed out of Fox News over allegations that he sexually harassed women. And there’s Jared Kushner, Trump’s    and a top adviser to the campaign, who tried to use a newspaper he owned  —   the New York Observer  —   to punish a real estate mogul, Richard Mack, for refusing a   on a loan.  Put this all together, and you get a picture of a businessman who’s done everything he can to enrich himself  —   at times going outside the bounds of the law. And he doesn’t seem to care if the people around him do the same. That presents a very serious threat to American norms against corruption. “Americans pride themselves on our politicians’ respect for the rule of law, on the checks and balances that protect us from the powerful,” Ezra Klein wrote earlier this year. “But as often as not, our real protection is found not in laws but in norms. ” And that’s the deeper problem underlying all this  —   that Trump has repeatedly shown he has little respect for norms of ethical or acceptable behavior. There’s been much discussion about how Trump has repeatedly violated political norms of acceptable behavior, with all the bigotry, racism, and sexism he’s spouted on and off the campaign trail. But his   track record in the business sector and the nonprofit world, and his management of his current campaign, suggests he’s willing to violate ethical norms too. He treats rules or laws as inconveniences. He ignores conflicts of interest. He takes what he wants, regardless of who gets hurt. And all this is when he is simply a wealthy businessperson. Yet if Trump wins in November, he becomes the most powerful person in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, the US military, and thousands of government appointees who can carry out his ideas at his disposal.    This is who Donald Trump is  —   and we’ve always known it            Throughout the campaign trail, there have been repeated suggestions that we will eventually find out who the “real” Trump is. The thinking goes something like this: Trump doesn’t really believe that Mexicans are criminals, Muslims are dangerous, women are objects for his pleasure, and so on. He’s just taking advantage of what many uneducated voters feel to try to rile up the conservative base to victory. Once he’s in power, he’ll be much more reasonable. Trump himself has pushed this myth, as Dara Lind reported for Vox:  When Ben Carson, during his endorsement speech in March, said that there were “two Donald Trumps,” Trump himself agreed: “There are probably two Donald Trumps. The public version  —   and people see that, and I don’t know what they see exactly, but it seems to have worked over my lifetime,  —   but it’s probably different, I think, than the personal Donald Trump. ” The personal Donald Trump, Carson and Trump implied, wasn’t a boor who would (say) casually accuse people of mental illness and sociopathy. He was a decent human being. And Trump all but promised that, if elected to the presidency, the kinder, gentler, more dignified Trump was the Trump that would rule the country. “When I’m president I’m a different person. I can do anything. I can be the most politically correct person you have ever seen,” he told Iowa rallygoers in January. “Right now they come at you from 15 different angles. You have to be sharp, you have to be quick, and you have to be somewhat vicious. When you are running the country, it is a different dialogue. ”  But there is no reason to believe this is the case. Trump has had different levels of power and authority over the years, from running an enormous international family business to campaigning for president. And time and time again, he has shown what he’s really like: He will do whatever he can to enrich himself, even if it means pushing or breaking the boundaries of the law. He will apparently hire and fire employees based on his racial biases and gross conceptions of women.  And he’ll never apologize for it  —   instead doubling down on even the most absurd controversies, from his insistence that the Central Park Five are guilty despite the DNA evidence to his vicious comments about Rosie O’Donnell to his justifications for not paying people he hired for work. This is who Trump is. That’s what the history tells us. So if Trump becomes president and behaves in the same way, none of us can say we weren’t warned. "
" When I go home to South Dakota to visit my family, I speak two languages.    One is the language of my new home in California, of my job in the national media, a freewheeling speech that blends irony and academia and weird jokes. You’re probably familiar with this language if you read a lot of   internet sites. The other is the language of my youth, and its hallmark is a sincere, aching tone that longs for salvation and worries everything is about to crumble. We talked a lot about the end of things when I was growing up, about the last trumpet and Armageddon. But when I sit and talk with family, it sounds almost as if the apocalypse came and went in the form of government regulation. When did this regulation happen? It’s never clear. The government has just gotten too big, too  . Aren’t you angry about that? goes the unspoken question. Well, you should be.    I don’t say anything. I don’t want to upset the precarious balance between old life and new. I just listen and laugh and nod.                If you want to understand the anger rippling through rural, white America, especially among older folks, sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild has written the single best book you can read. Called Strangers in Their Own Land, it concerns Hochschild’s visits to rural Louisiana, far from her home in Berkeley, California.  Hochschild’s deepest insight stopped me dead in my tracks. I went back and read it four or five times. She writes that the people she interviewed in Louisiana felt as if they were being made to feel certain ways because the media wanted them to.     They believed that if they found marriage equality to be a step too far, or if they didn’t entirely understand the meaning of or need for “Black Lives Matter,” or if they didn’t want to see sex depicted on TV, or if they thought owning a gun could be a lot of fun, well, they weren’t feeling the “right” way, and they would be mocked for doing so. Try to set aside, for a second, your political feelings on all of the above. Think only of how rarely people who feel any or all of the above are presented by mainstream mass media as sensible. There’s nothing wrong with owning a gun. There’s nothing wrong with being cautious about sex. There’s not even anything wrong with not immediately understanding the ideas behind Black Lives Matter. But how often does progressive pop culture treat any of the above cultural signifiers as the signs of a person with a rich inner life? People who believe the above are often presented as dumb yokels on TV and in movies, and if you push further, racists and sexists are presented as outright villains or “behind the times” in period pieces.     Even Mad Men, which flirted as much as any project recently has with endorsing casual racism and sexism, made sure to signal to the audience that it knew all of this was Not Okay through carefully chosen directorial and writing decisions. HBO’s Vice Principals, perhaps the only show on TV that truly tries to understand Trump’s America, prompted much fretting over whether the show recognized that its white male heroes  —   who were trying to tear down a black woman who had the job they wanted  —   knew what they were doing was Wrong, even as they were burning down her house.  Look back to the 1970s. Think of popular, Best Picture —  winning movies like The French Connection, where lead character Popeye Doyle is an unrepentant racist but gets the job done. Think of All in the Family’s Archie Bunker, a racist and sexist who, nonetheless, is fiercely loyal to his family and willing to admit when he’s underestimated someone based on the color of her skin.  These characters rarely exist in modern film and TV, or they’d be the butt of the joke, not allowed to make jokes of their own.   culture doesn’t attempt to understand; it attempts to isolate that which says “the wrong thing. ” It too often embraces easy moralizing over complexity  —   and even if you agree with the morals, that’s disappointing. National Review’s Henry Olsen even pointed to an Archie Bunker factor when he predicted a Trump victory was more likely than most other pundits believed. The online multicultural left is too often intent on making sure our entertainment, our news sources, and our political heroes send the “right” messages, that everybody learns the right things. But we’re increasingly only talking to ourselves. Hochschild notes that the people she spoke to in Louisiana emphasized what they believed to be a fundamental contradiction in liberalism: It was tolerant of everything but their views, which it called intolerant.  That’s true on both ends  —   conservative and progressive. Certainly, I’m not going to step back and say, during an argument about trans bathroom rights, “Wow, you really have a point about how trans people are just making up their identity so they can sneak into places where they don’t belong. ” Trying to empathize with that point of view rejects the lived experience of every trans person I know. But I also immediately snap, too often, to calling such views intolerant, instead of trying to figure out where they come from.    Older rural whites usually express their frustrations in some variation of “I’m sick of political correctness,” which I find maddening  —   since political correctness in my view just means treating people politely. What’s wrong with calling someone by their preferred pronouns? Nothing, if you’re steeped in ideas about antiquated gender binaries and the like. But if you’ve never even met a trans person, the existence of trans people, much less the idea that they have inherent rights, can be a big leap to make, as is the case for plenty of older rural whites. (See also: the close cousin to “I’m sick of political correctness,” “Why do people hate white men all of a sudden? ”)  To be clear: I do not want to advocate for giving an inch on any of these issues. Ending racial, misogynistic,   and classist power structures is essential to the future of this country, as is ending the enormous levels of income inequality. But I also think progressive America has become too quick to leap to crying racism or sexism  —   even when talking about genuinely dangerous, racist, and sexist ideas  —   instead of trying to unpack what’s motivating those ideas. The rise of the   shows that these dark ideas are not going away without a fight. That’s what makes it so important for progressives to get better at communicating what they mean and fighting for what they believe in. I say “racism” and mean “a system, built up over centuries of American history, that privileges white people over everybody else. ” Many rural whites hear “racism” and think it means, “You’re a bad person who hates black people,” when they believe they’re not actively discriminating against anyone because of race. And that goes for plenty of other terms as well  —   “privilege” or “rape culture” or even “feminism. ” There’s a communication gap, and there has to be a way to bridge it. Much of that is on rural white America, yes, but some of it necessarily is on urban progressives, as well.  Because if the 2016 election has made anything clear, it’s that older rural whites are now acting like an interest group, who will vote for any party that even pays lip service to their desires. And though their demographic power is waning, there are still a lot of them. And they watch TV. They believe they know what progressives think of them.  Okay, yes, this is another article about rural white people.    Amid the rise of Trump, trying to understand his supporters has become something of a cottage industry. There have been profiles, good and bad and satirical. There have been attempts to understand their plight via economic means and via racial anxiety.               There’s nothing wrong with any of that. Rural America has been hollowed out by a ruling class that no longer has much use for it. The Democratic Party sometimes pays lip service to rebuilding manufacturing communities via new job training and the like, but never seems to make doing so a priority  —   a bitter irony for those who remember when the Democrats were the party of labor.  Before I go any further, I want to clarify two things. The first is that this is not a piece about progressivism winning back rural America. I’m not sure such a thing is possible, en masse, and there are no easy answers to this problem.  Progressive economic policy might not be as redistributive as many (including myself) would like, but it is, on average, better for rural America than conservative economic policy. (See my colleagues Ezra Klein and Dylan Matthews for more on that point.) And over the course of my life, I’ve spoken with many people in rural America who know conservative economic policy won’t benefit them but care much more about deporting undocumented immigrants or ending abortion rights.  But there are also some rural whites  —   a minority, I think, but some  —   who are receptive to progressive messages on all sorts of economic and social policy issues but don’t feel heard or understood. There is a performative aspect to life in rural areas (which I wrote more about here) that too often gets overlooked, and I have had many, many conversations with rural whites who say Democrats just don’t hear them or understand them.  Again, I don’t think there’s an easy answer to this, but I think an answer does exist, and we ignore those who are receptive to it at our peril. But even if there isn’t an answer, empathy is a good thing, whether or not we still condemn rural whites’ various deeply held beliefs. Understanding where those beliefs come from is vital to crafting messages that will beat them back.    The second thing I want to clarify is that what I’m saying might seem like a rough gloss on Emmett Rensin’s excellent, earlier piece for this site “The smug style in American liberalism. ” And while my argument shares several points with Rensin’s  —   particularly when it comes to how progressives express themselves online  —   it’s more about how progressive America presents itself as the de facto face of all of America, often through its pop culture.  The whole of progressive America doesn’t have a lot of control over that, because progressives don’t all work in the entertainment industry. But rural America rarely sees itself reflected back in pop culture. That might seem like a silly complaint, but it’s creating alienation, as I’ll dig into below.  To grow up in rural America is to know that your odds of financial success are lower than ever before. Even a state with 2. 9 percent unemployment  —   like my home state  —   struggles with how wages have not risen at the same accelerated pace as the cost of living. To many of South Dakota’s children, finding success means leaving their hometowns, as I and some of my friends have, whether for urban areas within the state or other states entirely. I don’t want to understate the racial component here. It’s probably the most important part of understanding the rise of Trump. The forces driving Trump’s most fervent supporters are almost all racially based, from   positions to Trump’s proposed plan to ban Muslims from entering the US. (Read more on this topic from Matthews right here.) And even states with populations as monochromatic as South Dakota’s  —   it’s just over 86 percent white  —   can be driven to distraction by fear of a racial other. (For more on this topic, a recent This American Life episode is essential.)  But Trump didn’t just win South Dakota. He crushed South Dakota by around 30 percentage points. And I can’t help but feel as if the attempts to paint Trump supporters with the broadest possible brush  —   sometimes because they deserve it!  —   miss a fundamental part of his appeal, one that’s almost entirely cultural.                I was once one of those rural conservatives who would have voted for Trump gladly, a South Dakota boy rolling my eyes at how often the mainstream media missed the mark, turning us all into broad stereotypes.  And yet pop culture also seeded progressive ideas in my brain. I was a teenager when the first rumors that Ellen DeGeneres might be a lesbian, and that her sitcom character on the show Ellen might come out of the closet too, began to circulate. I bought the week’s Entertainment Weekly, which featured her, and read it carefully. Everything I’d been taught in church and from friends and family suggested that being gay was a terrible choice that some people made. But here was living proof that if you were going to “choose” to be gay, it probably wouldn’t be worth the hassle. DeGeneres’s name was being dragged through the mud endlessly by members of the religious right, and still she persisted with her plan to make her character the first gay lead character in American TV history. Well, I thought, she probably just is gay. She probably isn’t doing this for attention. It’s probably really important to her that she be allowed to be herself on her TV show. Still, I didn’t meet an out gay person until college. I lived in an incredibly small, incredibly homogeneous little town in South Dakota. I loved it, and love it still, but it didn’t present the best view of what the world is actually like.  I didn’t really get to know a black person, or someone of Latino descent, or a Muslim, until many, many years later, when I moved to Milwaukee and later Southern California. My wife frequently remarks on how she, another   native, didn’t meet anyone who was Jewish until she was 25.     I grew up in an environment that was kind, supportive, and nurturing. It was also incredibly cloistered. And as the 2016 presidential election approached, I saw friends from back home darkly ruminating on easily disproved rumors about how, say, the state of South Dakota was bringing in large cohorts of Syrian refugees and keeping them hidden in abandoned state facilities.  Progressives understand but still underestimate how ensconced we are in a progressive bubble  —   and how   the conservative bubble on the other side is as well. Can those bubbles be popped? I don’t know, but I’d like to hope so. Yes, we know Facebook is driving this isolation, but we can’t really contend with what it is to be someone who deeply believes himself to not be racist or homophobic or what have you  —   even if the policies he supports are racist or homophobic  —   and then feel as if everybody in America thinks that’s who you are. And we’ve barely begun to realize how much geography plays into this, how the diversity we see in America’s great urban centers has barely begun to spread into many rural areas. There’s nowhere to meet anymore, and progressive culture too often acts as if those who disagree with it are weird anomalies, not a major section of the country.             Near the end of his terrific new book The End of White Christian America, Public Religion Research Institute CEO Robert P. Jones points to a quote from Washington Post columnist E. J. Dionne calling white Protestantism the “civic and moral glue” that has held America together throughout much of its history. Jones writes:  [White Protestantism] spun a coherent national narrative, cultivated a common vocabulary, served as an institutional intermediary between whole sectors of society such as business and government, and curated symbols of national life, all of which created a sense of strong civil solidarity. . ..  The passing of White Christian America presents a unique challenge, analogous to the death of the patriarch who served, for good and ill, at the center of family life. Standing beside the resting place of White Christian America, amidst unprecedented diversity and renewed racial tensions, it’s unclear what could provide a similar civic glue again.     But on the left, at least, there’s an increasing attempt to create just that sort of civic glue sans religious affiliation. I call it progressive fundamentalism. (I’ll just state upfront here that progressive fundamentalism, by and large, is the province of   white folks. It’s more diverse than your average Trump rally and getting more so every day  —   but probably not yet by as much as your average progressive fundamentalist would like.) Here’s how I define progressive fundamentalism: It’s the idea that a sort of mildly diverse, cosmopolitan   has essentially “solved” society. It traffics in   optimism about multiculturalism, nods toward forms of diversity that don’t actually confront what it means to make an equal society, and emphasizes broad cultural signifiers of what it means to be “good. ” For much of the country, it’s best known through its pop cultural output, not what it really believes or stands for. Progressive fundamentalism’s primary defining characteristic is its urban cosmopolitanism, which means it includes a good number of economic conservatives who are socially moderate. But it at least flirts with real, open socialism every once in a while. (It maybe didn’t vote for Bernie Sanders, but it sure liked reading about his ideas.) A lot of it is performative, but I don’t mean that in the sense that progressives don’t genuinely care about, say, pop cultural diversity. Think of how many times you’ve read a piece about the importance of racially diverse casting in Hollywood projects (sometimes on this very website)  —   something that is, indeed, hugely important.  But think about how often you’ve read an article about diversity behind the scenes, or in talent agencies, or atop the show business executive food chain. Then think about how often you’ve heard about diversity of class, or diversity of religion, or diversity of political perspective. Hollywood diversity goes only so far and largely reflects the views of those who are economically comfortable and live in Brentwood. The lack of outcry about this seems to suggest a slippage between what progressives want and the lived reality of many rural whites  —   even if that’s not true.  Many white folks in the mainstream left  —   myself included  —   increasingly function in terms of making sure we follow the right rules and nod toward the right cultural signifiers: shopping at the right stores and watching the right TV shows and saying the right things in the right way. Do all of these things, and you will be saved, become woke.    Foreign policy theorists have a concept of “soft power”  —   the idea that a country’s cultural output has influence that extends beyond its borders. To put it another (vastly simplified) way, American TV shows and movies sell a vision of the US to other countries that makes us seem cooler than we actually are.  What’s happened in the cultural divide between progressive fundamentalists and the white Protestant remnants of our rural areas is sort of a   version of America as it appears onscreen. Movies and TV shows and music sell that superficially diverse, seemingly equitable society I talked about earlier, and that world seems further and further away from the rural viewers who are supposed to live in the same country as those creating that entertainment.  Think, for instance, of the Oscars So White movement. This was a huge deal for the online left, and justifiably so. It reflected how poor the film industry is at telling stories about the broad group of Americans out there who aren’t white.  But if you’re not ensconced in progressive news sources and simply tuned in to the Oscars, the constant pushing on this point by host Chris Rock and others must have seemed a little bizarre. Of course the Oscars don’t reflect America, a rural white person might think. I don’t see anybody who looks or acts like me.  That divide creates the subconscious sense that there’s a party somewhere that all these rural folks aren’t invited to  —   and everybody at the party is laughing at them, even as their towns grow more and more desperate, racked with economic pain, health crises, and opioid epidemics, problems that before 2016 were barely touched on at all in either conservative or progressive media. This idea comes up in every single book I’ve read about trying to understand the collapse of white, rural America.  Put another way: I’m increasingly convinced that too many on the left want the appearance of being equitable, rather than actual equality. So long as the picture looks right, it doesn’t matter who’s excluded from it. Where the right longs endlessly for a past that never was, an unchaotic 1950s that largely exists in its head, the cultural left seems trapped in hopes of a future that leaves out everybody who disagrees with it, where everything is okay because we’ve embraced a   diversity. It doesn’t realize how little its America looks like the America many others live in.    And some of that, to be clear, is on older rural whites. It’s not my fault that they live in homogeneous enclaves and believe that my downtown Los Angeles home must be surrounded by constant crime and near anarchy. (It’s not.) It’s not my fault that in my hometown, at least, nonwhites who visited when I was a child were treated as, at best, exotic curiosities. But I think we progressive fundamentalists can find other ways of both defending our ideals and listening to those who disagree without reflexively dismissing their concerns. Progressive economic policies, again, largely benefit rural whites when compared with conservative ones, but the culture we make and consume, and the politics we express on our Facebook walls, often seem like they only have room for city dwellers, no matter how much that’s not true.  Like religious fundamentalism, progressive fundamentalism, at the moment, is far more concerned with going through the motions of a   “good” life and belonging to the right movements than it is with actually trying to build relationships with people from outside of the fundamentalist core.  We understand the problems of abject poverty, but only abstractly, largely through data or statistics. We have limited experience with what it means to actually live through such a thing, whether in a rural area or an urban center. Similarly, we understand that people who live well outside of our progressive fundamentalist, urban core are people, too, but only abstractly.  When actually confronted with the messy realities  —   like the country electing Donald Trump president  —   we shut down just a little bit. We focus on the certainty we feel in our moral and philosophical codes and on that   future we expect will arrive any day now, but we ignore the very real pain and hurt going on in our own country. We can’t blame a nebulous “other” for Trump, not 100 percent. We were at fault, just a little bit. We treated him as a joke for a long, long time, and didn’t understand that treating him as a joke only gave him more power, because his core voters thought we were constantly mocking them all along.                 Let me tell you about where I grew up.  If you imagine America as a person, Armour, South Dakota, is a bump, a tiny little speck on the skin. You can drive through it in about a minute, if the town cop isn’t there to stop you. My wife  —   whose hometown population numbered just 2, 000 people  —   is quick to mock me for having grown up in Mayberry, and she’s not wrong. I describe it as a good place to be if you like to feel lonely, and I remember long   afternoons sitting on a green, humming electrical box, looking out over the endless horizon of my family’s farm. Main Street is emptier today than it was when I was a child, but those who still live in Armour have made worthy attempts to keep it lively. And the employment rate is stable, with most Armour residents driving to the nearby city (he said of a town with about 15, 000 people) of Mitchell for work. Armour’s Main Street is no longer the center of any universe, but it has settled, at least somewhat peacefully, into being part of a solar system. What I remember most about it is a feeling of stability. Living in Armour was a little like living inside a chrysalis. On the outside, it appeared unchanging, maybe growing a little bit harder, a little bit less flexible. But on the inside, massive changes were in motion.  Now, having moved away, I see the things my family didn’t talk about. Even in a town of 750 people or so, class distinctions were present. My family wasn’t absurdly rich or anything of the sort, but my parents had both gone to college and were insistent that my sister and I would go too, thanks to the money they set aside every month. We didn’t want for things. We had new clothes, and when I badly damaged the side of my dad’s pickup in an   tangle with a dumpster, it wasn’t the financial apocalypse it could have been.  Beyond that, my family was stable. My parents loved each other, and they loved their children. We went to church every Sunday. My father’s parents lived just a few miles away, and my mother’s parents weren’t too far  —   just a   car ride. I grew up surrounded by people who loved me and cheered for me and wanted me to succeed. I know my parents wish I would move back home, but they’re also a little pleased to tell people their son lives in Los Angeles. There were others in town who didn’t have such comfort. I didn’t realize it at the time, but Armour was haunted by social schisms that threatened to swallow us. We were all white. We were all Christian. We were all Republican (except for a friend who bragged about his family being the only Democrats in town; he might have been right). But we were not the same, not by a long shot.    A friend of mine, whose father owned a successful local business, lived in the biggest house any of us had ever seen. Anytime we visited someplace far away from our hometown  —   the top of the St. Louis arch, say  —   we’d joke that we could see his house from there. He would laugh but defensively say it wasn’t that big (which, objectively speaking, was true; it wasn’t a mansion or anything) and anyway, his dad had done a lot of the work to fix it up. Today, I understand that we weren’t just laughing in the   way that teenage boys laugh at each other. We were also trying, subtly, to restore some sense of the social order. No one should be so successful, went the undercurrent of the joke. We believed in being rewarded for hard work, in God’s blessings. But our ribbing longed for redistribution. And we never talked about those who really did live in abject poverty, just a few miles away  —   the Native Americans who had once ruled the prairies we lived on and were now trapped in a reservation prison we all wanted to believe was a gift. In her book White Trash, scholar Nancy Isenberg convincingly argues that the roots of American social and economic class  —   inherited from our British ancestors  —   stretch all the way back to the 1500s. The book is nothing less than a suggestion that the beating down of poor, rural whites is one of many ancient sins that America can’t quite find it in its heart to do penance for.  Reading Isenberg’s book made me realize, finally, how to talk about something I’ve always struggled to express. We Armourites were living right alongside a social caste system we didn’t dare discuss, but unlike the more obviously racist caste systems of other rural areas, this was one that the national media and government more or less accepted without question. I was lucky enough to have nice things, to have a shot at leaving South Dakota someday. Many of my peers did not. And we would never talk about it. We had our church and our schools and our social clubs. All of those institutions mediated the gap between have and have not. But we had our jokes, and our gossip, and our insinuations too. We built a shadow kingdom of resentment and anger, in hopes that our real one might remain upright and stable.             I think we haven’t adequately grappled, as a nation, with what it means to go from white Protestant America to progressive fundamentalist America  —   from the small towns to the cities.  Even as America has urbanized over the past two centuries, we maintain our national mythology around small towns. Certainly the growing pains associated with shifting from a solidly white majority to the   US that will arrive in 30 years or so are driving these anxieties, but so is the thought that the small town used to be the center of American discourse, even if that was mostly an illusion. Now it’s not even part of the conversation. So imagine you once lived in what seemed like a stable community, safe and predictable  —   or what it might be like to live in a place with a living memory of such a time. Beyond that, imagine that during this time, much of US popular culture seemed catered to making sure you felt validated in your life choices. As recently as the 1960s, film and television regularly told stories about rural America, and as recently as the 1990s, country music was seen as a vibrant, creative, explicitly traditionalist pop culture force. Now imagine that world fading  —   slowly at first, when the plant closed, or the family farmer couldn’t make ends meet, or the school consolidated with the one from the town next door. But then all of a sudden, it seemed to accelerate: businesses closing, kids moving away, opportunity dying, the best possible representation of your community on TV becoming Duck Dynasty, of all things.   And in a country where you assumed white Protestantism was the center of everything, religion is suddenly just not a major factor in public life at all. Marriage equality is the law of the land, and the media insists you should be happy about it.  Is the anger over the loss of that world driven by white supremacy and the patriarchy? Absolutely. But imagine yourself as that person again. You’d be freaked out too. In Strangers in Their Own Land, Hochschild hoped to understand how Louisianans whose lives had been hurt by the industrial pollution so rampant in the area could still support Republican politicians who wanted to slash government regulations. Her key finding  —   her “deep story,” she calls it  —   is that the people in these communities feel they’re being passed over, that their shot at the American dream is being taken by a whole bunch of people who don’t look and act like them: racial minorities, yes, but also city residents and LGBTQ citizens and even endangered animals. She imagines this feeling as a line, in which rural whites stand and wait while imagining that folks from other constituencies are cutting in ahead of them and being celebrated for doing so. The resulting discomfort and frustration is easiest to explain in terms of race and gender, and I don’t want to discount how this cultural anxiety has exploded, in ugly fashion, via racism and misogyny.  But Hochschild also unpacks how completely the modern world has torn apart these rural communities, simply by existing. The people she interviews can remember the world as it was, the beauty of the Louisiana swamps and the communities there, and they can see what it has become. One man, in particular, just wants to have a place where his adult children, who have since moved away, can find work and live near him. We, all of us, live within systems we don’t realize are systems. Think of the way Earth stretches before you when you’re out somewhere open and wild, how it seems to be a flat plane that buildings and mountains and trees have been plopped down upon. Intellectually, you know it’s a sphere, that you are held to it by gravity. But to just see it, that’s not always obvious. And yet it would be obvious if gravity suddenly weakened, or if the Earth rapidly began to contract. The system you live in would reveal itself. The questions of why evangelical Christians would support Trump, or why people who live in communities that are so predominantly white would be so   or why older white evangelicals are still so resistant to marriage equality are just three different masks concealing the same problem. Trump voters are people who suddenly realized  —   and I mean very rapidly, over a couple of decades  —   that the system they thought they lived in, where they thought they were at the center of the country’s power structures, isn’t the objective reality everybody else occupies, but rather a system that’s collapsing. Voting for Trump, then, isn’t just a cry of desperation. It’s the latest shot in a civil war where too many progressive fundamentalists have brought political comedy videos to a ballot fight.              I would guess that I have very little in common, politically, with J. D. Vance, author of the   memoir Hillbilly Elegy. The book is about his life growing up among the descendants of   immigrants in Kentucky and Ohio, before joining the Marines and eventually graduating from Yale Law School. He’s quite obviously a political conservative, while I’m a liberal who’s uncomfortable with liberalism’s frequent timidity when it comes to remaking the American polity. But I found myself nodding, over and over, at his conclusion that even now, having left behind his childhood and moved into the professional, ruling class, he finds himself trying to understand his new world, to operate by rules that are simply assumed by those he meets in this world to be known.  He finds himself in the unlikely position of translator, of trying to explain each world to the other and often becoming frustrated. His occasional feelings of inferiority in the face of this new life resonated deeply with me. And I was flabbergasted by how his tendency to either explode or completely retreat from conflict mirrors my own  —   and how he ties it to the rural past we share. I think, if I had the chance to talk with Vance, he would understand what I mean when I talk about progressive fundamentalism, even if he might disagree on the details. Progressive fundamentalism is just another system, one that you don’t realize is all around you until you step back. It’s one that encompasses those on the left and the right who would argue at length about   economics but blanch at the thought of outlawing marriages between two people of the same sex. It believes it has answers, but it mostly has data. Indeed, if you only got a glimpse of progressive America through its pop cultural output, it would barely seem to care about economics, seemingly believing, on some level, that the kinder, gentler capitalism of the Clinton and Obama administrations has solved inequality  —   and anyway, a lot of the people who are stuck on the less equal side of the ledger believe obviously inaccurate things.  Those who subscribe to progressive fundamentalism confuse their beliefs for a solution because they embrace the cosmopolitan world those beliefs thrive in. They tend to view other solutions  —   older ways of thinking  —   as outmoded and outdated, as something that should be scrapped. They may not immediately consider themselves to be part of a clash between civilizations, between a new America centered on progressive fundamentalism and an old America centered on white Protestantism, but everybody who’s still living in the latter believes in that war, and sometimes rides that belief to gigantic electoral outcomes. This discrepancy is what Vance and Hochschild and Jones and Isenberg and myself are all fretting over in the end. How do you translate messages between two different countries that share the same set of borders? For as much as I needle it, I do believe the cosmopolitan, more open, more diverse nature of progressive fundamentalism is a necessary improvement on the homogeneous nature of the old America.  And it’s not as if issues like marriage equality are something I’ll compromise on. Both Republicans and Democrats have fooled themselves, since the ’80s, into thinking American politics is an argument about how nice capitalism should be, when to a lot of people it’s about whether some of us should even exist.  Progressive fundamentalism, to use a religious metaphor, is lousy at witnessing for itself. It assumes that by looking cool on TV, it can win over those of us who could leave our small towns and move to a coast or major city. It assumes it doesn’t need to share the core tenets of its theology if it seems like a cool party.  But there are a lot of people left behind without the money or means to escape, people who might have once been receptive to these ideas but are now stuck. And they curdle.             Let me tell you about where I live now. Downtown Los Angeles is the culmination of a dream I had when I was 15, when I realized that all of the time I spent watching TV might someday be put to good use. Believe me, that I get paid to watch television isn’t lost on me as a kind of cruel joke the universe has played on everybody who doesn’t get to do the same. This fact inevitably comes up anytime I engage in Facebook arguments with people from back home  —   about Syrian refugees or transgender bathroom rights or anything else. They scoff at the thought that I could write about TV and get paid for it. But I do! And I live in a neighborhood with some of the best restaurants and nightlife in the country. We’ve got an amazing movie theater coming, and if I left my apartment at 2 in the morning, there would be people around, everywhere I went, who similarly want to share in my neighborhood’s bounty. We might smile at each other. We got out! our glimpses might say. We made it! But did we? Or did we trade one seemingly oppressive system for a completely different one? Because let me tell you more about where I live now. If I leave my apartment and turn a different direction, I’ll walk right into the heart of Skid Row, right into the heart of poverty so absolute that the brain’s automatic response is to try to shut it out. I drive through it often, watching this shadow society exist alongside my own, this place full of people who are my neighbors but who are ignored by so many as an inconvenience.  And as downtown LA gentrifies, the boundaries of Skid Row tighten a little more with each new year. There’s a skirmish on the horizon, between the progressive, gentrified world downtown LA is becoming and this place that has stood, for decades, as a community for those who have lost everything.  These are the faces not presented in the progressive fundamentalist version of Los Angeles. Yes, we might talk about the homeless problem in the abstract, or donate a little money to a charity. But someday it will become inconvenient to our newly gleaming edifices, and it and the people who live there will be washed away.              Remember the Jesusland map? It circulated widely online after the 2004 election, when George W. Bush narrowly squeaked out reelection over Democratic nominee John Kerry, thanks largely to religious conservative voters, who were driven to the polls by a slew of anti —  marriage equality measures. (The race was more complicated, of course, but that was the story that spun up in the immediate aftermath of the election.) It was an honest, if bitter, reaction to a   contest that ended in the reelection of a bad president, who was reelected (in this argument) almost entirely because of bullshit cultural allegiances. But it also catalyzed, for me, how swiftly the left’s reaction to rural whites had gone from, at worst, “They’re a little misguided,” to, “No, these people are fucking idiots. ” And again, maybe that’s where we want to go. I disagree with the people I grew up with on just about everything  —   whether political or social or cultural. Maybe the answer is just to go all in on the Democratic Party, maximize turnout of nonwhite voters and millennials in every election cycle, and hope time and demographic shifts will save us all. It didn’t work in 2016, but Hillary Clinton did still win a convincing popular vote victory. Maybe this strategy will work in 2020. However, I’d like to think progressive fundamentalists could articulate our values more effectively  —   and convince those who don’t share them to actually listen.  It’s absolutely necessary to call out the racism, sexism, and   sentiments inherent to many of the beliefs held by Trump and his surrogates, and we should be vigilant in doing so, at all times. But I think there are places where we can listen, too, and admit that on some of these points of wider cultural anxiety, there’s ample room for empathy. I’d like to think we could step forward not in the spirit of, “I have all the answers,” but in the spirit of, “I want to hear about your problems. ” When I started digging into the rumor I mentioned above that Syrian refugees were hiding out in an abandoned government facility in South Dakota, just to see where it came from, just to see if it was as racist as it seemed to be (and it was) everybody I talked to said some variation on the same thing: The people spreading this rumor might be angry and bitter and a little bit racist, but they’re good people. Really. To be honest, that sentiment seems to contradict itself. Those who peddle dark conspiracy theories driven by racial paranoia would seem to not be blameless by simple virtue of doing, well, that.  The more I thought about it and continued talking to people, the more I realized that what they meant was maybe the rumormongers weren’t always good people, but their defenders hoped they still could be. There exists some universe where we can all talk about these things, where we can remember that we’re all Americans, going over the cliff together. This, in a nutshell, is the American   ideal  —   the mythological apex we aspire to. But if Trump’s election proved anything to me, it’s that this vision of the small town where everybody (who’s white) can come together and have a chat about what’s troubling them is over. It’s increasingly a lie, a place that’s been lost beneath waves of bitter, vituperative backlash. The place dubbed Jesusland has lashed right back out to paint the (urban, progressive) world I live in as soft and “too PC. ” And, pardon my French, fuck that. Progressive fundamentalism has many, many, many faults, but it also has a compelling, competing vision of what America can and should be. That it has spent so much time trying to figure out how to understand rural America in the past year is, to me, a sign of its strength.  It makes room for everyone at the table, and it believes the stories of all people have inherent value and interest. It might not always live up to those ideals  —   and it needs to find a way to let rural whites know they are a part of its vision without compromising its larger ideals of diversity  —   but I’ll be damned if I’m going to be told that those ideals aren’t worth holding in the first place, that those ideas shouldn’t be the future of this country.  Our lives are beautiful and American too, but we do a lousy job of selling the emotion of that, the  —   dare I say it  —   patriotism of that. We’re lousy at owning up to our weak spots too. True political change comes from relationship building. Just look at how rapidly opinions on marriage equality changed as more Americans came to know the LGBTQ people in their midst. We should work to get better at building those relationships, at telling our stories. There are aspects of the old social order, now lost, worth mourning. Were there terrible things about it? Yes. Many. But there were also communities of people looking out for each other, places where you could feel like you knew yourself and everyone around you. I miss the one I grew up in every day  —   which may, to you, mark all of the above as a bunch of horseshit.  But I do believe there’s nothing wrong with stability, or with faith. We are all struggling toward the same answers and hoping for the same things. We just want to be understood, and we just want to be loved.  And I still believe the best way to build the world we want is to invite others in  —   even if they reject it, again and again. Progressives keep trying, because our America makes room for everybody, and it can make room for those who are receptive to its message in rural, white America too, if we can only bridge that communication gap. That’s not soft. That’s the biggest, strongest ideal this country has ever had.  Let’s make America great again. "
" Every episode of Gilmore Girls has a grace note. Every episode, even the very worst, has some weird, quirky jewel of a moment that makes the whole thing worth watching  —   even something as small as Rory casually roasting a marshmallow over her stove burner when she gets home from school, or Taylor showing off his horrible toupee.     Gilmore Girls premiered on the WB in the fall of 2000, and slowly grew into a sleeper hit. It’s a   show: Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham, who had better finally get an Emmy nod out of the upcoming Netflix revival) used to be a daughter of wealth and privilege. Then she got pregnant at 16. Now she’s raising her precocious teenage daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) in a whimsical small New England town and tentatively working toward reconciliation with her WASPy estranged parents, Emily (Kelly Bishop, also entitled to an Emmy nod) and Richard (the late Edward Herrmann). Gilmore Girls is coming back to Netflix on November 25, which means we’re about to get some closure on one of the best family dramedies of TV’s golden age. It also means now is the time to rank the episodes we already have, before the revival comes to skew the ratings. Ranking a TV show episode by episode reveals its bones. It tells us what the show is good at and, by extension, what matters to it. Gilmore Girls is a family drama, and it shines brightest when it’s delving into the fundamental trauma and dysfunction  —   and the warmth and the joy  —   of the Gilmore family.     Ranking Gilmore Girls was not an easy task. It’s a stunningly consistent show that rarely hits a false note, so how do you differentiate between two really good episodes of a really good show? Sure, there are outliers, like the almost universally reviled “Vineyard Valentine” and the almost universally beloved “Bracebridge Dinner”; but how do you decide if a “There’s the Rub” is better or worse than a “The Nanny and the Professor”? Do you lean more toward the aesthetic beauty of the early seasons, with their gorgeous tonal blend of warmth and melancholy, or toward the psychological complexity of the darker later seasons? And what do you do with the anomaly that is season seven, the only season of the show not produced by showrunner Amy   and her husband and writing partner, Daniel Palladino? (Both Palladinos have returned for the Netflix revival.)    We have a lot to wrestle with here. Let’s dive straight in and do it.  Update: We’ve now added the four episodes from Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, so these rankings are full and comprehensive. The new rankings are marked with an asterisk.     The very worst             157. ”That’s What You Get, Folks, for Makin’ Whoopee”  (season 7, episode 2) There are some rough episodes of Gilmore Girls, but only this one casually destroys a beloved character’s life for no reason. Lane, back from her honeymoon with Zach, announces that their first time together was so terrible that she has no plans to ever have sex again. Then she finds out she’s pregnant, meaning that she’ll have to put aside all the rock ’n’ roll dreams she’s strived toward over the past seven seasons.  It’s a heartbreaking ending to Lane’s arc, and what’s worse is that the show treats it as light comedy. Add to that the fact that the episode comes at the rocky beginning of the   seventh season  —   and the fact that Lane’s fate falls into the show’s unpleasant track record of punishing women when they lose their virginity  —   and you have all the makings of Gilmore Girls’ worst episode. 156. ”The Long Morrow” (season 7, episode 1) This is the first episode of Gilmore Girls written without Amy   at the helm, and boy does it show. The show struggles to find its signature screwball pacing, and it can’t figure out how to circle around emotions without addressing them face on, as the earlier seasons did at their best. And the townie hijinks  —   Kirk crashing Taylor’s car into Luke’s diner  —   are trying too hard to be whimsical; there’s so much effort onscreen that the show feels tense where it wants to be comforting.    155. ”A Vineyard Valentine” (season 6, episode 15) “A Vineyard Valentine” is easily the weakest of the Palladino episodes. Everyone operates as the worst and most harshly exaggerated versions of themselves: Luke, grumpy and passive aggressive, is at his most unsympathetic. Rory is   domestic in a manner that recalls her stint as Dean’s Donna Reed in season one. Lorelai spends most of her time compensating for the distance she feels from Luke and Rory with a stream of unfunny gay jokes. It’s not pleasant to watch.   154. ”Lorelai’s First Cotillion”  (season 7, episode 3) Gilmore Girls is stylistically off for most of season seven, and it’s at its worst at the beginning. At  ’s best, she wrote around emotions: What was most important was what remained unsaid in the slew of  . But in this episode, when Lorelai begins to wonder if she’s set up her life just to annoy her mother, she tells us exactly what she’s thinking and how she feels about it, with no indication that there’s anything lurking under the surface. The show has been flattened. 153. ”The Great Stink”  (season 7, episode 5) Season seven had a bad habit of retreading earlier seasons’ plots that weren’t that great to begin with. In this case, it’s the egg plot from season four’s “Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!” only now there are pickles stinking up Stars Hollow instead of rotten eggs. It was only a little funny in season four; it’s not at all funny in season seven.  152. ”Merry Fisticuffs”  (season 7, episode 10) As season seven goes, most of this episode isn’t that bad  —   the show had started to figure out how the characters fight again  —   but “Merry Fisticuffs” is the one where Christopher turns to Lorelai in bed and says, “Let’s make a baby,” and we all cringe for 10, 000 years. That’s enough to knock it down to the bottom of the list. Plus, it’s the culmination of that weird plot where Marty turns into a horrible person for no reason. 151. ”That Damn Donna Reed” (season 1, episode 14) Gilmore Girls took a while to find its voice, and a lot of the first season is just a little too saccharine. “That Damn Donna Reed” is a particular offender, worsened by the fact that it’s also thematically muddled. It starts off with Rory rejecting the idea of enforced femininity; it ends with her strapping on a frilly apron to please her boyfriend. In terms of both this episode and Rory’s character as a whole, it just doesn’t make sense. 150. ”Here Comes the Son”  (season 3, episode 21) “Here Comes the Son” is the backdoor pilot for what would have been Jess’s spinoff series, the hilariously titled Windward Circle. The WB shot six episodes, but stopped production before any of them came close to airing. Ostensibly that’s because the cost of shooting on Venice Beach was prohibitive, but based on this episode and the 30 seconds of the show you can find on YouTube, the more likely reason is that it was a terrible show. Nothing against Jess  —   he’s a good supporting character who drives story for our Gilmore girls well  —   but he’s not designed to be a main character who can carry his own show, and it shows.     Pretty Bad             149. ”You’ve Been Gilmored” (season 6, episode 14) Rory’s season six arc gets pretty dark, but it’s usually worth it for the character exploration. She spends most of the early seasons in a charmed state, getting everything she wants with minimal effort. Then when her internship with Mitchum Huntzberger goes south, she has to face real, consequential failure for the first time in her life, and she doesn’t do well at all. It’s hard to watch, but fascinating.  This episode undercuts everything that came before that made Rory’s season six journey interesting. Just as Rory is finally starting to get her life together, Paris has a meltdown and is ousted as the editor of the Yale Daily News  —   and the board votes unanimously to replace her with Rory. Against Rory’s shock and protestations. Meaning that Rory is once again living a life in which her accomplishments are handed to her while she makes a Taylor Swift surprised face, and the idea of working hard and campaigning for a goal, the way that Paris regularly does, is unthinkable. It makes all of Rory’s character growth up to this point highly questionable.  148. ”Women of Questionable Morals” (season 5, episode 11) Lorelai’s    whimsical rants often walk the fine line between “endearing” and “annoying,” but this episode tips over into “downright irritating” territory. Lorelai shouts about how she no longer loves snow and how she and snow are breaking up, kicking at it in her cutesy rage, and not even Preternaturally Charming Person Lauren Graham can save the moment. 147. ”Tippecanoe and Taylor, Too” (season 5, episode 4) This is the episode where Jackson ousts Taylor as town selectman, after which he spends one episode doing selectman duties and then Taylor takes over again as if nothing ever happened. Expecting continuity from Gilmore Girls is a fool’s game, but come on.  146. ”He’s Slippin’ ’Em Bread . .. Dig?” (season 6, episode 10) I will always resent Zach for this episode. He sabotages Hep Alien’s gig in a fit of jealousy, setting Lane and her dreams back months and even making her cry. And he still gets to marry her and live out her rock ’n’ roll dreams by going on tour while she’s stuck at home with the kids? Whatever. 145. ”Application Anxiety” (season 3, episode 3) One of the unfortunate things about the     arc is that Gilmore Girls neither knows nor cares much about what it’s actually like to apply to an elite college, so it has to reach to find compelling story points. This is the episode where Rory meets the dull cliché of a Harvard family, and while its biggest offense is that it’s boring, well, that’s a pretty big offense on Gilmore Girls.    144. ”To Whom It May Concern” (season 7, episode 12) Season seven showrunner David Rosenthal can’t really be blamed for the fact that Melissa McCarthy got pregnant and he had to work it into the story somehow. He can be blamed for his solution: Make Jackson lie to his wife about the vasectomy he supposedly got. Suddenly this generally sweet supporting romance took on a weirdly toxic dynamic.  143. ”Go, Bulldogs!” (season 7, episode 6) Lorelai and Christopher go to Parents’ Weekend at Yale; Luke reveals that he cannot swim (which   …     doesn’t he go fishing all the time? Isn’t that a safety risk? When he threw Jess into that lake, was he actually trying to kill him?) and dates April’s swim instructor. This show is never   nonstop thrills, but what makes it work is the flair and charm of the writing and the character insights it produces. Season seven hasn’t worked that out yet, so when it tries to do a classic   Gilmore plot, the result is deadly dull. Snooooooooze.  142. ”Bridesmaids Revisited” (season 6, episode 16) This is the period of season six where Lorelai and Rory spend all their time walking around with little frown lines permanently etched into their faces because their boyfriends are being so awful to them. It’s wearing, and not in particularly interesting ways. Plus, Lane seals her doom by agreeing to marry Zach, and Christopher’s fantastically annoying other daughter Gigi has tons of screentime. But look on the bright side: There’s a   Leslie Odom Jr. there. 141. ”I’m OK, You’re OK” (season 6, episode 17) The episode opens with a fantastic, classic scene of Paris and Rory eating Chinese food and swearing off men together; if that was all there were to this episode it would be in the top 10 easily. But then Logan manipulates Rory into saying she forgives him for cheating on her, and the rest of the episode is back to Lorelai and Rory’s faces slowly melting in sorrow.  140. ”Concert Interruptus” (season 1, episode 13) This is a lovely early moment in the slow development of Rory and Paris’s friendship. It also doubles as a mini Bangles concert DVD. Still pretty rough             139. ”Knit, People, Knit!”  (season 7, episode 9) At a certain point season seven gets a pretty solid handle on the show’s character dynamics, but it takes a lot longer to figure out the Gilmore Girls style. That balancing act is evident here: The Stars Hollow    is an attempt at vintage Stars Hollow quirk that really doesn’t land, but there’s a lot of good character and thematic work in this episode. We get to see Christopher and Lorelai as partners in crime as they fend off Emily’s terrifying wedding present  —   and then we get to see just how much Christopher doesn’t fit into Lorelai’s Stars Hollow life. Plus, Paris and Doyle “  dance. ”    138. ”French Twist” (season 7, episode 7) Watching season seven, it’s clear that Christopher and Lorelai are never going to last: Luke and Lorelai are obviously going to end the show together, and the   storyline is just an obstacle that has to be hurdled. But this episode attempts to justify the fantasy of Lorelai and Christopher, trying to convince us their history is meaningful enough that Lorelai actually would throw caution to the wind and get married in Paris. It doesn’t quite pull it off, but the softness in Graham’s face and voice as she says, “Even then, you were so   …     sweet,” almost sells it. 137. ”I Am Kayak, Hear Me Roar” (season 7, episode 15) You can’t really go wrong with an episode that features Lorelai and Emily locked in a room together for a long stretch of time. Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop are extraordinarily gifted actresses who play beautifully against each other, and the mingled love and resentment of Lorelai and Emily’s relationship forms one of the show’s richest emotional wells. That said, the season seven writers never quite figured out how to hit the oblique angles in their relationship the way   did  —   the insults inside the compliments, the declarations of love inside the insults. It works, just barely, but that’s because Graham and Bishop make it work. 136. ”I’d Rather Be in Philadelphia”  (season 7, episode 13) In keeping with season seven’s habit of redoing plots from earlier seasons, but not as well, “I’d Rather Be in Philadelphia” revisits the     plot from season one’s “Forgiveness and Stuff. ” Only this time, Emily gets a super      speech that ends with, “He’s all I have, Lorelai! He’s all I have!” Stylistically, it’s jarring. But the rest of the family dynamics play out beautifully, with Emily sublimating, Rory overachieving, and Lorelai trying to keep them all together. Plus, the slow disintegration of Lorelai and Christopher’s relationship becomes inevitable here. 135. ”Run Away, Little Boy” (season 2, episode 9) Bonus points for being the episode that definitively sends Chad Michael Murray on his way for good. Minus points for featuring so much of Chad Michael Murray on his way out. 134. ”Love, Daisies and Troubadours” (episode 1, episode 21) The first season finale is by far the show’s worst season finale. It leans into all of season one’s worst impulses: It’s just a little too twee and whimsical, and a little too focused on romantic relationships at the expense of the core familial relationships. But that final shot of Lorelai and Rory  —   running toward each other across Stars Hollow, through buckets and buckets of yellow daisies  —   is lovely and joyous.  133. ”Paris Is Burning” (season 1, episode 11) This episode is the first one that gestures at humanizing Paris  —   and if it does so just a little   that’s season one for you. It’s still the beginning of one of the show’s best character arcs. On the other hand, any episode that devotes this much screen time to the question of whether Lorelai and Max Medina should date (they should! then they shouldn’t!) is at least a little bit of a waste.    132. ”P. S. I Lo. ..” (season 1, episode 20) Season one’s weakest element is its love stories, and this episode leans into them hard. (Apologies to the 12 people who are solidly Team Dean and Team Max.) But it also features the first time Rory chooses Emily and Richard over Lorelai, running away to stay at their house after she gets into a fight with Lorelai over Dean. That’s a pattern that will develop into one of the show’s most revealing and compelling character dynamics.  131. ”Pulp Friction” (season 5, episode 17) If you remember this episode solely for the Quentin Tarantino party  —   a   classic set piece, if only for the background actors doing the Pulp Fiction dance  —   you will have no idea why I placed it so low. Allow me to jog your memory: This is the episode where Michel wins an RV on The Price Is Right and tries to sell it out of the Dragonfly’s driveway. You’re with me now, right? 130. ”Come Home” (season 5, episode 12)   has a weakness for violent jealousy in her male love interests. It’s never all that charming to begin with, and rarely is it less charming than when Richard forcefully   Emily’s car after he sees her talking to another man. Still, isn’t it a relief to have the elder Gilmores finally reunite after their separation? Just okay             129. ”Take the Deviled Eggs. ..” (season 3, episode 6) Sure, Rory and Lorelai are    —   that’s a basic part of their characterization. But usually when they’re   to the point of wanton destruction of innocent people’s property, the show recognizes that they’re in a bad place. But this episode plays Lorelai trashing Sherry’s bathroom and Rory trashing Jess’s car for light laughs. It doesn’t quite work, sounding a note that’s more sour and   than the show usually is. But the town loner subplot is enormous fun, and Jess and Luke’s confrontation over Jess’s new job at Walmart is  . (“Jess, are you a gigolo? ”) 128. ”Double Date” (season 1, episode 12) Jackson’s cousin Rune is a very season one character: just a little too quirky and a little too broad. But this episode demonstrates that the show had figured out how to balance and mirror its Lorelai and Rory storylines with its matching double date plots. It’s also the first episode to suggest a little bit of depth to Mrs. Kim, who searches frantically for Lane after she sneaks off to her terrible date. 127. ”I Solemnly Swear” (season 3, episode 11) Season three of Gilmore Girls is close to tonally perfect; at this point in its run, the show knew exactly how to balance quirk with melancholy. As such, there aren’t many bad points to the season, but it does have two major weaknesses: the Francie student government plot and Billy Burke as Alex, Lorelai’s dullest love interest. This episode features both of them  —   but its tone is still right in that season three sweet spot.     126. ”Die, Jerk” (season 4, episode 8) Bruce, Sookie’s   is not funny, and she takes up way too much of this episode. But Rory’s plot  —   in which she calls a ballerina a hippo in a published review  —   is a nice milestone in the slow destruction of her angelic Stars Hollow image. 125. ”Norman Mailer, I’m Pregnant!” (season 5, episode 6) Why is it that the women on this show always lose their minds when they’re pregnant? Is it problematic to treat Norman Mailer as a harmless old iced tea —  loving coot when we all know he stabbed his wife? Is the scene where Rory confronts her deadbeat dad and tells him to stop breaking her mom’s heart whenever it’s convenient to him one of the most satisfying moments of the series? This episode is a real brain teaser. 124. ”The Lorelais’ First Day at Chilton” (season 1, episode 2) This is a   episode. The pilot gave us Stars Hollow and Rory and Lorelai; the second episode gives us Chilton and Paris and assorted townies. (Plus Kirk with his original name, Mick. I have a theory that Kirk is actually 12 identical brothers, 11 of whom are named Kirk and one of whom is named Mick, and I dare you to disprove it.) This episode works a little too hard to establish Rory and Lorelai as fish out of water at Chilton  —   Lorelai’s cowgirl outfit is    ridiculous, and early Paris doesn’t have the complexity she’ll later develop  —   but it gives the show a solid foundation on which to build.  123. “Christopher Returns” (season 1, episode 15) This episode has to establish Rory and Lorelai’s relationship with Christopher, and it does so beautifully. He’s an erratic, inconstant presence in their lives  —   he’s never even been to Stars Hollow before this episode  —   but when he’s there, he charms them both into almost forgetting all about his absences. Season one only hints at the emotional damage this dynamic has and will wrought, but it will get clearer and clearer over the course of the show. 122. ”We Got Us a Pippi Virgin” (season 5, episode 5) Early season five struggles with how to handle the show’s second   on the Dean romance. Rory’s choice to rekindle their relationship is clearly a desperate attempt to return to her secure childhood self after struggling in her first year at college, but they’ve just as clearly outgrown each other  —   they can’t even fit into her car when they try to go parking  —   and it’s awkward to watch. This episode handles it better than most, through the simple expedient of looping Lorelai into the plot and letting Lauren Graham’s face express exactly how uncomfortable the whole thing feels.    121. ”Jews and Chinese Food” (season 5, episode 15) So Luke sneaks onto Lorelai’s property to take away the boat that she bought with her own money, and I am so exasperated that I cannot fully appreciate Kirk playing Tevye in the Stars Hollow Elementary School production of Fiddler on the Roof. But nothing can tarnish the scene where Luke and Lorelai watch Kirk and that tiny little girl with the enormous voice singing “Do You Love Me?”  —   it’s a perfect mixture of weird and unsettling and tragic and lovely.  120. ”’S Wonderful, ’S Marvelous” (season 7, episode 4) Fan consensus is that Krysten Ritter and her   sidekick, introduced here, are Rory’s most annoying friends. Fan consensus is incorrect; Rory needed more than her grand total of three friends (one of whom is her mother) and Krysten Ritter is always a good thing. Watching Rory and her two new friends delightedly raid Logan’s extensive popcorn collection after a student art show is an enormous relief after the dourness of season six. Now we’re warming up             119. ”Introducing Lorelai Planetarium” (season 7, episode 8) Watching Lorelai and Rory fight is always hard, but Gilmore Girls always seemed to find interesting and   ways for them to do it. When Rory tears into Lorelai for getting married without her there, season seven proves it still has the ability to make those fights work. 118. ”Santa’s Secret Stuff” (season 7, episode 11) The Palladinos never wrote a   episode (  has said that at a certain point she just decided that the Gilmores were Jews in WASP bodies) so this entry established an entire secret history of Christmas traditions for Lorelai and Rory. Seven seasons in, that’s not an easy chore, but everything this episode invents  —   red and green M&Ms in the cereal for breakfast, candy cane coffee at Weston’s because Luke would never make his coffee so froufrou  —   fits perfectly into the Gilmore universe. 117. ”Hay Bale Maze”  (season 7, episode 18) Amy   has said that the biggest thing she’d change about season seven would be Rory’s arc, so it’ll be interesting to see where she takes the character in the Netflix revival. Season seven’s Rory arc feels less like a continuous piece of the story   was telling and more like an attempt to   in the face of fan criticism that Rory was getting increasingly entitled and  . I have faith that   was pointing Rory in an interesting direction  —   but the course correction was fun to watch in its own right. Season seven Rory spends a lot of time learning that it would be good for her to have friends, that she is privileged, and that sometimes she will try her hardest at things and fail anyway  —   and while it doesn’t feel of a piece with the earlier seasons, it’s still awfully satisfying to watch. In “Hay Bale Maze,” overachieving and overthinking Rory finally decides to risk everything to reach a goal. Strategically it’s not a great choice (PSA: don’t turn down a   job offer because you also applied to a prestigious   fellowship in the same field) but on a character level, it was an important decision for her to make.    116. ”Sadie, Sadie” (season 2, episode 1) Most of this episode is taken up with Max Medina and Dean silliness. But there’s a perfect moment where Emily finds out that Lorelai got engaged and didn’t tell her, which almost makes the rest of the episode worthwhile. 115. ”Hammers and Veils” (season 2, episode 2) Also known as the episode where Dean finally develops a personality, and it sucks. Dean’s controlling streak steadily emerges throughout season two, first revealing itself when he gets angry that Rory needs to put in work to get into Harvard instead of spending all her time with him. It’s a weird look on a character that the show continues to insist is a perfect first boyfriend. But most of this episode is about Emily   Lorelai after finding out about her engagement to Max, and Lorelai’s resulting bewildered anger  —   and that will carry you anywhere. 114. “Lorelai Out of Water” (season 3, episode 12) This episode has a forgettable Billy Burke —  centric   but the MVP here is Lane. She finally works up the courage to tell her mother that she’s in love with Dave Rygalski (and who could blame her?) only for Mrs. Kim to stare blankly at her and say, “He’s not Korean. ” Oh, Lane. 113. ”Keg! Max!” (season 3, episode 19) It’s rare for Gilmore Girls to spend much time on a fistfight  —   it’s such a talky show that most of its physical fights are comedic little slapfests. But season three gives Dean and Jess’s inevitable showdown the kind of loving buildup the show normally reserves for a first kiss. Every time they see each other they glare violently, and all the other characters keep gossiping about whether they’ve fought yet. When they finally do, the result is incredibly cathartic. 112. ”The Nanny and the Professor” (season 4, episode 10) Paris’s fling with    Asher Fleming is mined for laughs, but it’s also a little uncomfortable to watch    Paris throw herself into a relationship with a much older authority figure. But it’s all worth it for the scene where Lorelai is trying to guess his age and Rory keeps gesturing upward. 111. ”The Deer Hunters” (season 1, episode 4) The show is still finding its voice here  —   Lorelai showing up late to a Chilton parents’ night in a band   is the kind of    “look how quirky and different!” hijinks the show will later mature away from  —   but Rory’s horrified, “I got hit by a deer!” is immortal.     110. ”Will You Be My Lorelai Gilmore?” (season 7, episode 16) In the utter tragedy that is Lane’s season seven arc, at least she gets one moment of happiness  —   even if it is just a baby shower where she’s bedridden. Her conversation with Rory is a sweet grace note in their friendship, and the look of glee on her face as Zach and Rory push her bed through the town square is incredibly joyful.  Getting warmer             109. ”  Lovers and Other Strangers” (season 1, episode 16) Rory and Dean’s   anniversary date is adorably teenaged  —   check that visual of them sipping their Cokes at the fancy restaurant  —   and their breakup is a great, revealing character moment. Dean’s freakout when Rory tells him she isn’t ready to say “I love you” presages what a weirdo control freak he’ll turn out to be. More importantly, Rory’s refusal to tell Dean that loves him is our first glimpse at just how much her parents’ saga has affected the way she thinks about relationships. 108. ”The Ins and Outs of Inns” (season 2, episode 8) Independence Inn owner Mia is a weird background character, one who’s theoretically enormously important to both Rory and Lorelai  —   we learn here that she more or less raised them both  —   but who’s only rarely mentioned. But the easy warmth of Elizabeth Franz in the role makes it easy to buy Mia’s importance while she’s here, and her final confrontation with Emily is just gorgeous. 107. ”Dear Emily and Richard” (season 3, episode 13) Let’s get this out of the way: The actress playing young Lorelai here is a terrible match for Lauren Graham. It’s a big ask for any young actor to produce the enormous amount of warmth and charm Graham exudes in every episode, but this actress doesn’t even match Graham’s speaking patterns. (Plus, her eyes are a different color.) But this episode is the closest we get to seeing the primordial family wounds that power the rest of the show. Even without a great young Lorelai, the look on Emily’s face as she reads her daughter’s goodbye letter speaks volumes. 106. ”Ballrooms and Biscotti” (season 4, episode 1) Mostly the season four premiere is just Lorelai and Rory being charming and quippy. Not much happens, but it’s the calm before the storm. Over the rest of the season they’ll have more and more trouble connecting, until everything ends with Rory screaming at Lorelai that she hates her. But here, in the episode that bookends “Raincoats and Recipes” (note the matching alliteration) they’re at their closest and in perfect sync.  105. ”Secrets and Loans” (season 2, episode 11) It’s always a treat when a theater vet like Kelly Bishop gets something to sink her teeth into. Watch her face during the scene with Lorelai in the banker’s office: When the banker explains to Lorelai that she’ll need her mother to   her loan, Emily demurely sips her coffee with an air of utter innocence, pointedly refusing to make eye contact with Lorelai. It’s a perfect   ’   moment.    104. ”One’s Got Class and the Other One Dyes” (season 3, episode 4) It took Gilmore Girls two seasons to give Lane an arc, but it finally happens at the beginning of season three, where we first meet her band. The band that will come to be known as Hep Alien gives Lane’s heretofore vague rock ’n’ roll dreams shape and substance, and giving her people to interact with besides Rory and Mrs. Kim adds shading and nuance to her character. (Side note: Keiko Agena should really consider giving that purple hair a try again; she rocked it.) 103. ”Back in the Saddle Again” (season 2, episode 18) Any time Richard and Paris interact is a good time, and this episode  —   in which Richard is the adviser for Rory and Paris’s economics class project  —   is the beginning of their beautiful friendship. Also always fun: Brad, the boy who cannot see Paris without shaking in fear, admitting that of course he has tried to build a robot.  102. ”Always a Godmother, Never a God” (season 6, episode 4) Season six is the season where Rory and Lorelai start off not speaking to each other. While that’s exciting from a character standpoint, it also messes with the chemistry of the show, which is built off Rory and Lorelai spouting nonstop quips at each other. This episode sees what happens if you put them in a room and all they do is   bicker about cellphones, and it’s weird and unsettling in that quietly fascinating way that is season six’s specialty. 101. ”A Messenger, Nothing More” (season 5, episode 2) Part of Lorelai’s charm is her whimsical arrested development, so it’s always kind of a kick to see her change into   professional mode. That’s what she’s doing here as she works to get the Dragonfly Inn into gear, charging around town so fast that Lane nicknames her the Blur. It’s not just because the Dragonfly is a new business, though: It’s because she’s estranged from Rory, and her budding relationship with Luke is on hiatus while he helps Liz at her Renaissance Faire. This is solo Lorelai in   mode, and it’s fascinating to watch.  100. ”Welcome to the Doll House”  (season 6, episode 6) At the beginning of the   coupling, Gilmore Girls consistently links Logan’s appeal to his wealth: Most of the episodes early in their relationship feature Rory talking about how broke she is as Logan is lavishes her with extravagant presents and dates. It’s not that she’s a gold digger, but part of Logan’s allure at this point is that he belongs to a world of wealth, glamour, and privilege at a time when Rory is growing increasingly tired of the world she grew up in.  What makes this episode interesting is that it’s where that allure begins to wear off. Logan spends thousands of dollars buying Rory a Birkin bag, and she has no idea what it is or why it’s such a status symbol  —   nor does she have any interest in it. It’s an early suggestion that Rory isn’t fitting into Logan’s world as well as she’d hoped.    Getting into some pretty solid TV here, folks             99. ”Lost and Found” (season 2, episode 15) Lorelai and Jess have more or less identical personalities  —   give or take 16 years’ worth of maturity  —   so of course they hate each other. “Lost and Found” is the one episode where they try to make nice, and while their efforts are   it’s fun to watch them bounce Euell Gibbons references off each other while it lasts. 98. ”Chicken or Beef?” (season 4, episode 4) Rory’s been at college for a few episodes now, but here’s where it finally becomes clear that her childhood in Stars Hollow is over: Dean gets married, and Rory starts rocking her     bob. This is the episode where Rory first starts to realize that she can’t go home again; by the end of the season, she’ll want to go home so desperately that she’ll help Dean blow up his marriage to do it. 97. “Dead Uncles and Vegetables” (season 2, episode 17) Imagine: an entire alternate universe series where Rory and Lorelai are   diner waitresses, constantly shouting, ”Burn one and pass me a pink stick and throw some mud on it!” Alas, in this universe we must settle for just one episode  —   but this one also features Freaks and Geeks’ Dave Allen as Taylor’s nemesis, so it’s all good.  96. ”So . .. Good Talk” (season 5, episode 16) Okay, remember that thing a few entries up about how early   is all about Logan lavishing Rory with gifts when she’s broke? This is what I’m talking about. Rory’s at the coffee stand downsizing her order because she can’t afford the large caramel macchiato she wanted, and Logan shows up and bails her out  —   and it’s not a bad thing! In fact, it’s a   thing.  Logan represents the life that Rory would have had if Lorelai hadn’t turned her back on the Gilmores. And given all the similarities between Logan and Christopher, you can read this stage in their relationship as Rory’s attempt to do Lorelai’s adolescence over  —   only this time, Lorelai won’t get pregnant and won’t dump the nice, feckless rich boy Emily and Richard love. Keep that in mind when we get to “The New and Improved Lorelai. ” 95. ” ” (season 3, episode 15) One of the most compelling things about Rory and Jess at this point of the show is how incredibly, tragically teenaged and doomed they feel. This episode more or less writes the couple’s death sentence: You know they’re not going to last past the season after a full episode of Jess consistently standing Rory up and Rory being too insecure and passive to call him on it. The episode’s final shot, of Rory curled up somberly on her bed, feels like an elegy for something that’s not quite over yet. 94. ”Say Goodnight, Gracie” (season 3, episode 20) And here is where Rory and Jess’s relationship gets definitively blown up. (For the time being  —   I’d be seriously shocked if the revival didn’t revisit their relationship in some capacity or other.) That last scene of them sitting in silence at the back of the bus, completely unable to talk to each other, is a gut punch  —   but not quite as much of a gut punch as Jess’s big confrontation with Luke, and the heartbroken disappointment that settles over both their faces as Luke says, “Then you gotta go. ”  Thank goodness Lane and Dave are there to lighten the mood. Let’s be real, Dave reading the entire Bible in one night in an attempt to win Mrs. Kim’s permission to date Lane is the most romantic thing anyone ever did on this show.  93. ”Just Like Gwen and Gavin” (season 6, episode 12) This episode   the infamous “Lorelai spends season six with her face slowly melting from sorrow because Luke is being so awful” plot, which knocks it down a few notches, but here it’s still fresh and interesting. The look of shock and horror on her face when she realizes Luke has been keeping his daughter from her, and the way it later morphs into resignation when he leaps at her offer to postpone the wedding, is a killer. But for levity, there’s Paul Anka the dog dressed up as a swami! 92. ”To Live and Let Diorama” (season 5, episode 18) The dioramic history of Stars Hollow is one of the weirdest and creepiest set pieces Gilmore Girls ever gave us, like the Mormon history section of Angels in America on acid. (The divining rod! The mute son!) Plus, Paris gets a chance to get her Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown on, and Paris in breakdown mode is always fun. 91. ”A Family Matter” (season 4, episode 12) Season four starts clicking hard right around here. Lane’s   war of wills with Mrs. Kim is coming to a head. Lorelai and Digger are at their bantering best. (No one wants to see Lorelai and Digger together forever, but Chris Eigeman was born to deliver Amy   dialogue.) Lorelai and Luke’s unresolved tension is steadily rocketing up as the season heads toward the finale. And it’s beginning to become clear to Rory that she’ll eventually have to face all the problems she intended to leave behind in Stars Hollow  —   particularly her unresolved issues with Jess, who returns for the first time since season three in this episode. 90. ”The UnGraduate” (season 6, episode 3) Here’s where Rory decides to devote all of her overachieving,   tendencies to her new life. Everyone at all her community service gigs loves her. She’s crushing it at the DAR. She’s completely won Emily over by volunteering to act as her socialite spy. And over in Stars Hollow, Lorelai’s devoting all her mothering energies to Paul Anka and the construction crew remodeling her house  —   she even babies T. J. even though she, like all   people, must find him incredibly annoying. But Rory and Lorelai still both clearly despise their new lives. As a character study, this episode shows off what season six does best.  Real talk, these are all   episodes of TV             89. ”Say Goodbye to Daisy Miller” (season 5, episode 1) Season five begins and ends with Rory and Lorelai at loggerheads, but this fight is just a dress rehearsal for the one that ends the season. It’s nothing they can’t fix with an episode or two apart and a heartfelt apology, but it’s the first time we ever see Rory sulking like an angry teenager and Lorelai going sarcastic and cutting. They’re replicating Lorelai and Emily’s dynamic, and it’s heartbreaking.  Plus, this episode gives us one of the   great Richard and Emily moments: “Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch!” “Well, then, buy me a boa and send me to Reno, because I am open for business!”                                       88. ”The Lorelais’ First Day at Yale” (season 4, episode 2) “Ballrooms and Biscotti” was just a prologue. Now we get the real thematic setup for season four: Rory wants to go home really badly, so badly that she’ll violate all sorts of boundaries to get there. Here she’s just asking her mom to stay over for her first night of college  —   no matter how cool Lorelai is, that’s a major violation of the college freshman social rulebook  —   but by the end of the season, her discomfort with her new life will manifest itself more   with Dean. Lorelai, in the meantime, is really concerned with the purity and   of Rory’s bed. Here, it’s her mattress and it’s funny; later it’ll be her virginity, and it’ll be heartbreaking.  87. ”Kill Me Now” (season 1, episode 3) This is the first episode that gives Richard much of anything to do, and it’s fitting that most of what he does is take Rory golfing and fall madly in love with her. It’s also the first episode to make explicit the conflict that will drive the rest of the show: Lorelai is terrified that her parents will steal Rory from her, not just because it means she’ll lose her daughter and her best friend but also because it means her parents can use Rory to replace Lorelai, so she’ll lose them all over again, too.  86. ”An Affair to Remember” (season 4, episode 6) The   feud between Emily and Digger is one of the show’s most underrated, and this is the episode that kicks it all off, as Richard and Digger prepare to launch their new partnership. It’s a joy to watch Richard’s wife and business partner make polite social smiles at each other and trade quips at top speed while they hate each other behind their eyes. No one else can goad Emily into condescending baby voices like Digger can. 85. ”Eight O’Clock at the Oasis” (season 3, episode 5) Fans remember this episode for two reasons. First of all, it’s the one featuring a young Jon Hamm at his most dapper and dashing, playing the world’s most boring man. (He’s so boring Lorelai won’t even consider a second date when baited with David Bowie tickets, and you know Lorelai loves her some Thin White Duke.) Second, it’s the one where the WB demanded the show play to the network’s target demographic and give them some scantily clad teens, so Rory and Jess run through some sprinklers, get soaking wet, and stare at each other awhile. Less discussed is the subplot with Emily and Richard’s charity auction, but it’s extremely fun: Richard forcefully explaining that Emily will be served the first cup of tea if she wants the first cup of tea is one of his sweetest and most romantic moments. 84. ”Farewell, My Pet” (season 7, episode 14) And the death knell of Chris and Lorelai comes at last. Even the most hardened Christopher hater has to hurt a little when Lauren Graham says, “You are the man I want to want,” with a sob in her voice. 83. ”Gilmore Girls Only” (season 7, episode 17) As the show winds to a close, season seven turns its attention to its richest and most complex relationship: the   dynamic between Emily, Lorelai, and Rory as they go on a road trip. You can’t really lose with that sort of material. David Rosenthal’s take on the core relationships is both less textured and less toxic than Amy  ’s, but with the end so near, the show can afford to err on the side of warmth. Plus, Lorelai gently ribbing Emily over her Will Smith crush is just fun. 82. ”The Road Trip to Harvard” (season 2, episode 4) The show’s other road trip episode is firmly in the   mold: It’s incredibly sweet until you think about it, and then it all turns melancholy. Lorelai and Rory taking their    shtick on the road is charming, and Rory finally getting a chance to see the school she’s been dreaming about is lovely. But this is an early instance of Lorelai reacting to a problem by running away from it, a pattern both she and Rory will repeat again and again. Seeing Lorelai look wistfully at photos of what would have been her graduating class, it’s hard not to wonder how much Rory wants to go to Harvard for herself and how much she wants to go so that she can live out Lorelai’s dreams for her. 81. ”A Tale of Poes and Fire” (season 3, episode 17) As season three approaches its end, it has to shut the door on a few arcs. This episode gets them ready to go: Rory, at long last, abandons her dream of going to Harvard in favor of Yale, signaling that she’s about to stop living out Lorelai’s dreams. (Of course, after she spends season four trying to live out her own dreams, she gets sucked into Emily and Richard’s in five and six. Maybe in the revival she’ll start living out her own? We’re rooting for you, Rory Gilmore!) And more dramatically, the Independence Inn burns down, spurring Lorelai and Sookie to move forward with their plans for the Dragonfly.  80. ”It’s Just Like Riding a Bike” (season 7, episode 19) This is basically the only time on the show that Rory fails to meet a major professional goal that she worked hard for, and where it’s also clear that the entity telling her she failed isn’t being vindictive or personal. She tried for a competitive fellowship at the New York Times, and she just didn’t get it, and that’s it. This is where we get to see if Rory learned anything from the whole Mitchum Huntzberger affair, or whether she’ll be terrible at dealing with failure forever. Pretty good             79. ”It Should’ve Been Lorelai” (season 2, episode 14) Reasons to remember this episode: Paris beautifully traumatizes poor Brad in a debate on assisted suicide. Twin Peaks’ Madchen Amick makes her debut as Sherry, Christopher’s annoyingly perfect girlfriend, and only Emily is able to give voice to the resentment that Lorelai won’t allow herself to feel: It should have been Lorelai, they both think, that Christopher settled down with. And when Lorelai tells Christopher that she’s given up on that dream at the end of the episode, he screams at her, because Christopher can’t handle the idea that he has an emotional responsibility toward the mother of his child. Christopher is charming, but he can be hard to like. 78. ”The Hobbit, the Sofa, and Digger Stiles” (season 4, episode 3) Digger is one of Lorelai’s   boyfriends, mostly because he appears in season four, right when the   subplot is clearly building toward some kind of resolution. But Digger does his job perfectly: He’s charming enough to be a compelling obstacle for Luke and Lorelai, but neurotic and weird enough that you know he’s not going to be a permanent obstacle. As a bonus, he’s the only one of Lorelai’s temporary boyfriends who is also interesting to watch (sorry, Max Medina, Billy Burke) and he knows exactly how to deliver  ’s breakneck screwball banter. 77. ”Pilot” (season 1, episode 1) The pilot isn’t perfect: the rhythms of the dialogue aren’t quite in place yet; the emotional dynamics are sketched out rather than lived in. But it lays a solid, beautiful foundation for everything that is to come. 76. ”The Third Lorelai” (season 1, episode 18) It’s always great to watch Emily’s slow,   meltdowns over Trix, Richard’s disapproving mother. Trix is introduced here for the first time, and watching Emily frantically search for all of her   ’s old gifts so that she can display them properly is so much fun that it makes sense Trix would become a favorite recurring guest. Plus, this episode matches Emily’s slow, panicked   meltdown with Paris’s slow,   meltdown over her date with Tristan. (Although ugh, Tristan.) 75. ”Help Wanted” (season 2, episode 20) The tension between Richard and Lorelai is a lot more muted than the tension between Emily and Lorelai. Richard is rarely as vicious as Emily can be  —   he’s more prone to silent lack of interest  —   but when he decides to talk, he can shut Lorelai up in a way Emily can never manage to do. So it’s nice to see them get a chance to bond here, as Lorelai fills in for Richard’s secretary while he sets up his new office, and Richard finally realizes just how smart and capable his daughter really is. 74. ”Presenting Lorelai Gilmore” (season 2, episode 6) Speaking of Richard, after spending most of the first season behind his newspaper, he finally gets a plot to himself in season two: He’s getting phased out at work, and it’s making him miserable. He keeps blowing off Emily’s biggest social events, and he even makes a scene at the debutante ball Rory only agreed to do as a favor to cheer him up. Meanwhile, Lorelai and the newly stable Christopher get a chance to show off their smoking chemistry  —   Lorelai lights up more with him than anyone else  —   right before Christopher informs Lorelai that he’s seeing someone else.  73. ”Nick &   & Nancy” (season 2, episode 5) Of all Rory’s love interests, Jess is probably the most controversial among fans. Depending on whom you talk to, he’s either Rory’s soul mate or the worst person ever to appear in Stars Hollow. In his first episode, he’s mostly just a hilariously nonthreatening bad boy, posing with his cigarettes and deck of cards like he thinks he’s a 1950s greaser. But his presence catalyzes one of the tonal shifts that elevates season two above season one. Gilmore Girls can get sweet to the point of saccharinity without someone around to undercut its   quirkiness, and Jess’s   bewilderment at Stars Hollow’s bucolic charms helps balance things beautifully.  72. ”But Not as Cute as Pushkin” (season 5, episode 10) Rory is at her most endearingly nerdy in this episode. She’s 100 percent convinced that her high school prospective student will want to hear all about the history of the Eli Yale bench, and that of course she’ll want to sniff an old copy of Pushkin  —   who wouldn’t? Oh, Rory. 71. ”Happy Birthday, Baby” (season 3, episode 18) And here’s Rory at her most endearingly manic, running around town like a nut as she tries to coordinate Lorelai’s enormous surprise birthday party. Alexis Bledel gets a lot of flak from fans for her acting abilities, but she’s surprisingly capable when it comes to physical comedy: Just watch her ineffectively fling her tiny self at a giant trolley full of sodas. 70. ”The Perfect Dress” (season 6, episode 11) The second we see in Lorelai in her (not perfect, in fact actively ugly) wedding dress, we know this wedding is never going to happen. It’s gutting to watch her beaming up at Luke at the end of the episode, knowing he’s keeping something huge from her. Season six is big on the sense of foreboding doom, and it doesn’t always do it well  —   but here it’s still fresh enough to be unsettling and effective.  Even better             69. ”But I’m a Gilmore!” (season 5, episode 19) After a season spent watching Rory become steadily more enamored of the glamour and privilege of Logan’s world, here’s where it becomes clear that she’s completely lost in it. Faced with the Huntzbergers’ snobbery, she reacts with some of her own: “But I’m a Gilmore! My ancestors came over on the Mayflower!” It’s not exactly pleasant to watch, but it’s a key moment for her arc. Insecure,   Rory has decided to start pleasing the rich people instead of her mother, and that’s going to have catastrophic  —   and fascinating  —   repercussions.  68. ”Red Light on the Wedding Night” (season 2, episode 3) Certain Gilmore Girls moments are so perfectly pitched that they ring in your ears long after you’ve seen the episodes in which they live. Most of this episode is pleasantly forgettable  —   Lorelai has the bachelorette party for her wedding with Max Medina, Michel dances with drag queens, it’s fun and light and quirky  —   but the ending is different. Lorelai at the end of this episode, panicked, near tears, and running on adrenaline, saying, “Because I don’t want to try on my wedding dress every night,” is one of those     moments.  67. ”Afterboom” (season 4, episode 19) Season four sees Richard being increasingly dismissive of Emily and Emily being increasingly resentful in turn, but it’s still shocking when they separate. They’re the grandparents! They’re supposed to live in WASPy dysfunction together forever! But thematically, it’s perfect: Lorelai is about to achieve the biggest goal of her adult life and open her own inn, so of course her parents  —   her biggest connection to her childhood  —   have to implode.  66. ”Those    Days” (season 3, episode 1) Season three is the most tonally beautiful season of Gilmore Girls. The banter is sharp as a knife, Stars Hollow exudes warmth, and everything is gently touched with just the right amount of melancholy. This premiere is a perfect encapsulation of that tone: There’s Rory and Lorelai frolicking through the town square and then bickering while “Those Lazy Crazy Hazy Days” drones in the background; and there’s the turn from that warm,   festival to Lorelai crying quietly in Luke’s diner. 65. ”Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!” (season 4, episode 18) By Gilmore Girls standards, there’s a surprising amount of plot in this episode  —   Digger’s dad announces he’s going to sue Richard and Richard in turn   Digger, kicking off all kinds of   corporate hijinks  —   but it still leaves room for some beautiful grace notes. There’s Taylor’s horrifying toupee, which prompts Lorelai to politely ask him to repeat himself three times because she can’t stop staring at his head long enough to listen to what he’s saying. And there’s Lorelai’s monologue on the mystery of what happened to all the anvils  —   an   classic moment. 64. ”Super Cool Party People” (season 6, episode 20) Lorelai throwing April the world’s greatest birthday party is such a heartbreaker: Lorelai’s so good with April, and they get along so well, that you get visions of a parallel world where Luke and Anna weren’t stricken with   madness and allowed April to actually spend time with her future stepmother. Meanwhile, Rory finally gets to rip Mitchum Huntzberger a new one a year after he crushed her dreams, and it is incredibly satisfying. 63. ”Love and War and Snow” (season 1, episode 8) This is one of those very early episodes where we can see the show really figuring out its formula: The town will have some aggressively, endearingly twee event  —   in this case, keeping vigil in the snow to reenact a Revolutionary War battle that almost happened  —   and Luke will grumpily tend to everyone’s welfare while Rory and Lorelai deal with mild romantic drama and interference from Emily and Richard. And this Max Medina plotline, as he and Lorelai struggle to figure out if she can date openly now that Rory’s a teenager, is about as compelling as the Max Medina arc ever gets. 62. ”How Many Kropogs to Cape Cod?” (season 5, episode 20) As Lorelai painfully   it through a Friday night dinner of Emily and Richard fawning over Rory and Logan, it becomes clear that Emily and Richard are making the most of their  . Rory is their new Lorelai  —   a   biddable,    Lorelai  —   and wealthy, charming Logan is their new Christopher. And after what happened with the last Lorelai and Christopher, Emily and Richard waste no time trying to push the new versions into marriage. The extent to which Rory finds herself reenacting that primordial family rift over and over again is never clearer than it is here. Plus, the cold open where Lorelai and Rory watch their Roombas over the phone together in near silence is a contender for the best cold open in TV history. 61. ”The Breakup, Part 2” (season 1, episode 17) Here’s where the show’s “they’re mother and daughter, but also best friends!” conceit gets to really shine, as Lorelai gently pushes Rory to mourn her first big breakup instead of repressing her pain in a flurry of manic activity. The warmth and genuine affection of their bond comes alive in the wake of heartbreak, and it’s lovely to watch. 60. ”Written in the Stars” (season 5, episode 3) Logan makes his first appearance in this episode, casually dehumanizing Marty and then justifying it with the ol’ “it’s a FREE COUNTRY” argument. But honestly, who cares? This episode is all about Luke and Lorelai on their first real date. Luke’s speech, as he remembers the first time he met Lorelai and how he’s kept the horoscope she gave him ever since, is one of the most swooningly romantic moments of the show  —   and Lorelai’s silence in response creates a moment that will be reexplored, heartbreakingly, in “Say Something. ” This show is so good             59. ”New and Improved Lorelai” (season 6, episode 1) The great   rift takes hold. What makes it all the more painful is that Lorelai knows at once that this rift is going to be total and dramatic, but Rory doesn’t  —   she’s still looking for Lorelai as she stands in the courtroom awaiting her   sentencing. Rory’s a   so traumatized by her father’s abandonment that she almost never cuts people out of her life, and she’s secure enough in the safety of her relationship with her mother that it never occurs to her that Lorelai might cut her out. But when someone hurts Lorelai, she cuts them off for good, and she’s even willing to do that to her daughter if she’s hurt badly enough. When Rory goes to her grandparents, she’s completing that primordial family trauma that began the show and replacing Lorelai in Emily and Richard’s lives  —   and that hurts Lorelai enough to make the rift complete. 58. ”Cinnamon’s Wake” (season 1, episode 5) This is one of the only episodes that tries to humanize Babette instead of using her as a background joke. As she sorts through her dead cat’s old pills and reminisces about Morey, she tells Lorelai, sweetly, “I never thought a man would ever even want me,” and it’s a lovely moment. 57. ”Forgiveness and Stuff” (season 1, episode 10) Emily and Richard’s wonderful,   loving hospital room scene in the wake of Richard’s angina attack is even harder to watch now that Edward Herrmann is gone. “Yes, Emily, you may go first. ”  56. ”The Big One” (season 3, episode 16) Of all the show’s Paris meltdowns, this just might be the best. Liza Weil always makes a meal out of scenes where she gets to stare straight ahead with a manic glint in her eye and soliloquize for a while, and this speech  —   about getting denied admission to Harvard, which she is sure happened because she had sex  —   is a doozy. (Still not great that this show keeps punishing women when they lose their virginity, but at least Paris got into other schools.) 55. ”Fight Face” (season 6, episode 2) Rory and Lorelai have their first    encounter since the rift began, and it’s vicious. They both know how to hurt each other better than anyone else, and for the first time since the show began, they’re taking out all their knives. It’s the deliberate hurtfulness of scenes like this that, in retrospect, helps the sweetness of the earlier seasons land better: It shows the downside of mother and daughter being best friends first, because it means they fight the way best friends do.  54. ”  Is the Loneliest Number” (season 6, episode 7) And here’s the first time Lorelai and Rory consider being cordial to each other since the rift. Lauren Graham does beautiful things with her voice through the whole show, but the way she says, “Hey there, birthday girl,” with a hopeful, hesitant shiver in her tone, is a killer. And Madeleine Albright’s cameo in Rory’s dream is a gorgeous, funny, and wistful moment of surrealism. 53. ”Driving Miss Gilmore” (season 6, episode 21) Emily’s offer to buy Lorelai a new house in Stars Hollow where she and Luke can live is genuinely thoughtful  —   which makes it all the more wrenching when Lorelai’s face folds in on itself and she says, “Luke and I. The wedding. It’s not gonna happen. ” 52. ”Kiss and Tell” (season 1, episode 7) Sometimes it’s nice when this show just does cute. And Rory sprinting across Stars Hollow, clutching a box of cornstarch and shrieking, “I got kissed! And I shoplifted!” is pretty darn cute. 51. ”Lorelai? Lorelai?” (season 7, episode 20) Look, a scene where Lorelai reveals she’s still in love with Luke by serenading him at karaoke would certainly never have happened under Amy  ’s watch  —   it’s too straightforward and sweetly simple for her tastes  —   but that doesn’t mean it’s not a lovely, tender moment. 50. ”Unto the Breach” (season 7, episode 21) As the show heads to its series finale, it closes down the plots that have been defining Rory’s arc for the past few seasons: she graduates from Yale, and she breaks up with Logan. This is an elegant, graceful transitional episode that honors the past while also setting the stage for Rory’s departure to bigger and better things in the finale. And the moment when Lorelai, fighting back tears, jumps to her feet and applauds as Rory graduates   —   well, let’s just say you should keep the tissues handy. We’ve reached the top 50, and shit’s getting real             49. ”Emily in Wonderland” (season 1, episode 19) The setup here is fantastic. At first it looks like Emily, in Stars Hollow for the day, will be completely won over by the town’s quirky charm  —   she loves haggling over antiques with Mrs. Kim, in a moment that proves those two should have become best friends  —   but then she sees for the first time the potter’s shed where Lorelai and Rory lived after they ran away, and is heartbroken. Her outraged, “You hated us that much!” is sad and lovely. 48. ”Richard in Stars Hollow” (season 2, episode 12) Here’s one of the darkest and saddest endings of the show’s run. Richard, at loose ends since his retirement, has spent the episode driving every single member of his family insane by meddling in their business in his politely, absently judgmental fashion. So the end of the episode finds him sitting alone in his study in the dark, pointedly not inflicting himself on the people he loves. It’s strange and lonely and bleak. 47. ”Haunted Leg” (season 3, episode 2) Christopher basically traumatized both Lorelai and Rory  —   seriously, you can trace half their issues back to his disappearance from their lives  —   but he’s so charming that they don’t yell at him nearly as much as they should. So when they both read him the riot act in this episode, and then Emily follows it up with the world’s most chilling, “Go home, Christopher,” it’s immensely satisfying. It’s also incredibly sad. 46. ”The Real Paul Anka” (season 6, episode 18) Jess has probably the most elaborate arc of all of Rory’s boyfriends. Where Dean and Logan are primarily important for what they show us about Rory and her character development, Jess is also important for what he shows us about Luke and his character development, which means we see Jess from two perspectives instead of one. And both Luke and Rory are pretty pleased with where Jess ends up in his final episode, having finally gotten his shit together and found some stability working for a      it’s super unclear what the hell Truncheon Books is supposed to be, but it seems okay? It’s a satisfying culmination to Jess’s troubled arc. 45. ”Ted Koppel’s Big Night Out” (season 4, episode 9) Watching Paris flirt inappropriately with Richard is one of this show’s greatest joys, all the more so for how sporadically it happens. Watch for the look of sheer disgusted horror on Rory’s face as Paris says, “You are a   devil, aren’t you, Dick?” Neatly, it also serves as foreshadowing for Paris’s romance with Asher Fleming, also introduced in this episode.  44. ”Swan Song” (season 3, episode 14) There are two fantastic things about this episode. First, there’s the sublime look of joy on Luke’s face as Jess says, “I was attacked by a swan. ” Second, there’s the fact that for the first time on the show, Rory is dating a boy she has chemistry with (a nice change in and of itself) meaning that for the first time on the show, she and Lorelai have to have the sex talk. Lorelai is convinced on some deep, unconscious level that once Rory has sex Lorelai will lose her the way Emily lost Lorelai, but she keeps trying to convince herself that she’s okay with the concept. The resulting conversations are strained and careful in a way that foreshadows the next season’s big fight. 43. ”Like Mother, Like Daughter” (season 2, episode 7) Emily and Lorelai runway   to “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” and everything is beautiful and perfect and wonderful forever.                                       42. ”The Prodigal Daughter Returns” (season 6, episode 9) Okay, yes, Rory’s incredibly annoying job hunt in this episode was clearly written by someone who hasn’t had to look for an   job in many years, and it hasn’t aged well since the 2008 crash. And yes, this is where April’s introduced, and while she’s a likable character played by a talented young actress, I think we can all agree that giving Luke a secret daughter was a pretty clumsy move,  . But look, Rory and Lorelai finally heal their rift! They sob and throw themselves into each other’s arms! Finally and at last! 41. ”   ” (season 2, episode 13) It’s pretty charming to watch Rory and Jess   for half an episode while Luke and Lorelai just   flirt across the square  —   but it’s downright fascinating to see Lorelai realize that when it comes to Rory’s love life, she has more than a little Emily in her. It’s mostly light and comic here  —   Lorelai says, “My mother agreed with me,” in horror, and Rory sweetly responds, “Oh, I’m so sorry!”  —   but it will get more and more serious as the show goes on. 40. ”In the Clamor and the Clangor” (season 4, episode 11) Luke and Lorelai are often at their most compelling when they’re not dating. When they’re together, the show feels compelled to give them conflict, and most of it’s forced and inorganic. But when they’re apart, they’re all longing looks and charged banter, and that’s really where Gilmore Girls shines. They reach their flirty peak here, as they become partners in crime to dismantle Stars Hollow’s incredibly annoying church bells. We’re getting into classic territory here             39. ”The Fundamental Things Apply” (season 4, episode 5) Apparently the downside of being born with Alexis Bledel’s angelic face is that you never develop any game at all. This episode shows us Rory facing romantic rejection for the first time in the entire course of the show, at the beginning of the only season in which she doesn’t have two boys fighting over her at one point or another. For Rory, who finds most of her   in other people’s validation, it’s a horrifying development. 38. ”There’s the Rub” (season 2, episode 16) It’s a crime that Jess and Paris only had one major interaction, especially when it’s as fun as this one. Paris   Jess’s taste in books! Jess teaches Paris how to eat fast food! Rory is so relieved that she’s not hanging out with Dean! It’s just a sparkly scene. But the real meat of the episode lies with Emily and Lorelai, who are forced to work through all their baggage on their spa weekend. When Lorelai finally convinces Emily to steal a spa robe as a symbol of their time there, it’s one of their warmest and most hopeful  .  37. ”Let the Games Begin” (season 3, episode 8) When Rory begins to seriously consider Yale over Harvard, it’s one of her first steps toward living her life for herself instead of for someone else (in this case, Lorelai). That’ll be a long and halting journey, but it’s the fundamental basis of her arc, and this episode is an important milestone along the way. 36. ”Last Week Fights, This Week Tights” (season 4, episode 21) Luke and Lorelai dance together, and it’s incredibly romantic and lovely. Jess asks Rory to run away with him, and it’s incredibly upsetting and sad. Emotions are running high here as what is arguably the show’s best season ramps up! 35. ”Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels”  (season 4, episode 13) One of the signs of just how deeply Christopher hurt Rory is that the worst thing any of her boyfriends can do is leave her. After she’s spent half a season denying that she cares Jess took off without a word at the end of season three, here it becomes clear that she’s heartbroken, and that she considers what Jess did to be a far greater betrayal of trust than, for instance, Logan cheating on her.  34. ”The Incredible Sinking Lorelais” (season 4, episode 14) Both Rory and Lorelai more or less graduated last season  —   Rory from high school, Lorelai from the warm and cozy embrace of the Independence Inn  —   and now they’re floundering on their own. Watching them fall apart in tandem, as they try desperately to connect and fail, is necessary setup for the fallout to come at the end of the season. 33. ”The Festival of Living Art” (season 4, episode 7) The Festival of Living Art is one of Stars Hollow’s most gorgeous and most elaborate set pieces, from Kirk’s method take on “The Last Supper” to Lorelai’s flinching Renoir girl. Not that much else happens here besides everyone looking pretty in their makeup, but not that much else needs to. 32. ”I Get a Sidekick Out of You” (season 6, episode 19) In the midst of all the sturm und drang that is season six, it’s nice to have a moment of pure joy. When Lorelai rips off Lane’s tearaway wedding skirt and Zach crows, “My wife’s got legs!” as Lane kicks gleefully, we get it. 31. ”The Party’s Over” (season 5, episode 8) Watch Lorelai’s face at the end of this episode. When Rory spills out of Logan’s limo o’ dudes, champagne drunk and dripping with diamonds, she’s officially transferred her allegiances over to the elder Gilmore world, and Lorelai knows it. It just takes her until the end of the season to admit it. 30. ”Emily Says Hello” (season 5, episode 9) Kelly Bishop is always fantastic as Emily, but as this episode ends with her going inside, flushed and pleased with herself after a date, only to break into sobs in her empty house, she’s extraordinary. At this point, everything’s pretty close to perfect             29. ”We’ve Got Magic to Do” (season 6, episode 5) Of course, Kelly Bishop is also extraordinary here, as she rips Logan’s mother into little shreds. Let’s just relive the speech in full, as it cannot be improved upon with commentary:  Well, let me tell you this, Shira. We are just as good as you are. You don’t think Rory is good enough for your son  —   as if we don’t know Logan’s reputation. We do. But he is welcome in our home anytime, and you should extend the same courtesy to Rory. Now let’s talk about your money. You were a   gold digger, fresh off the bus from Hicksville, when you met Mitchum at whatever bar you happened to stumble into. And what made Mitchum decide to choose you to marry amongst the pack of women he was bedding at the time, I’ll never know. But hats off to you for bagging him. He’s still a playboy, you know? Well, of course you know. That would explain why your weight goes up and down 30 pounds every other month. But that’s your cross to bear.  But these are ugly realities. No one needs to talk about them. Those kids are staying together for as long as they like. You won’t stop them. Now, enjoy the event.   28. ”Say Something” (season 5, episode 14) Lorelai and Luke break up (the first time) and Lorelai melts down. No one does “struck immobile with grief” quite like Lauren Graham, and her whispered “Say something” as she watches herself in her dream sequence is haunting. 27. ”Rory’s Birthday Parties” (season 1, episode 6) Emily spends a lot of the first few episodes acting as though no time at all has passed since Lorelai left home  —   as though Lorelai’s still a recalcitrant teenager, Rory’s still an adorable doll of a child, and Emily still knows best. She’ll continue to lapse into that mode throughout the show, but here, for the first time, she’s forced to recognize that Lorelai had an entire life that Emily knows almost nothing about. Her quiet “We don’t know our daughter at all” to Richard at the end of the episode packs an enormous punch. 26. ”The Reigning Lorelai” (season 4, episode 16) Trix’s death means that we lose the     feud, but its last hurrah here is a delight, with Emily going   Lucille Bluth. “I think we should just toss some cheese cubes in the coffin, stuff some toothpicks in her mouth, and let the people go to town,” is a perfect line.                                        25. ”That’ll Do, Pig” (season 3, episode 10)   As fun as it is when Trix dies (morbid, sorry) she’s just as much fun when she’s alive. The   of the Gilmores following her anxiously through her silent inspection of Lorelai’s house is a stunner, and it’s perfectly capped off when Rory chirps, “Have fun!” and Emily turns on her with a cold, “Nobody appreciates your sarcasm, young lady. ” *24. Winter (season 8, episode 1) The great pleasure of “Winter” is the pleasure of returning. There’s Lorelai, sitting on the steps of the Stars Hollow gazebo, drinking coffee, just as though she never left. She sighs, and you sigh with her: We’re back.  Most of this episode is spent setting up the story   will be spooling out over the next few episodes  —   resetting the board after season seven and eight years of hiatus, establishing the new status quo  —   but it does so ably.   has limited time left, and she knows exactly what story she wants to tell with it. 23. ”A   Korean Thanksgiving” (season 3, episode 9) There’s a reason the Netflix revival is coming back over Thanksgiving: Gilmore Girls is a perfect Thanksgiving show, rife with warmth and coziness and enormous amounts of food and familial discord. It’s astonishing that the show only did one   Thanksgiving episode, but at least that one is a classic. 22. ”Luke Can See Her Face” (season 4, episode 20) After building up the Luke and Lorelai subplot for four seasons, here’s where the show finally gives us some payoff. What makes it work so well is how simple that payoff is: Luke realizes he’s into Lorelai, says, “Wow,” and asks her out. She says yes. That’s it. It’s the understatement that makes it land. 21. ”You Jump, I Jump, Jack” (season 5, episode 7) This is the episode that has to sell the fantasy of Logan’s world, and the Life and Death Brigade, and all those rich kids doing irresponsible things that Rory’s going to find so fascinating over the next season or so. It manages because it is so immensely gorgeous. Before this episode, wealth was firmly associated with Richard and Emily, meaning it felt old and stuffy next to Lorelai’s youthful bohemian verve  —   but now it’s beautiful young people in formalwear, wandering through pristine white tents in candlelight. You get why Rory finds it so compelling. 20. ”Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin’ the Twist” (season 4, episode 17) Rory spends season four trying and failing to figure out how normal college students have fun. It’s not something she’ll work out until she falls in with Logan and his crowd, but this is one of her most endearing failures. Hey, who wouldn’t go to Florida just to sit in a motel room and watch Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth? Plus, this episode is beloved by   shippers for giving them a canon kiss.                                         And even closer             19. ”Scene in a Mall” (season 4, episode 15) Any episode where Emily gets to go on a tear is a great episode. Here, she barely stops for breath as she marches through the mall, buying everything in sight in an attempt to get back at Richard for ignoring her  —   but Richard, of course, never even notices that she bought anything. This is the episode that makes Emily’s season four existential crisis land, and it’s why you buy her separation from Richard at the end of the season. 18. ”Wedding Bell Blues” (season 5, episode 13) Of course the 100th episode of the show had to be, at its core, about Emily and Lorelai’s curdled relationship. When Lorelai hisses in Emily’s ear, “You and me? We’re done,” after Emily sabotages her relationship with Luke, you feel all the weight of years of arguments, betrayals, and attempts at reconciliation. *17. Spring (season 8, episode 2) Viewers have been yelling at Emily and Lorelai to get some therapy for seasons now, so it’s exciting to see them actually follow our advice. It helps that the therapy sessions feel like a reprise of that famous ending to “Friday Night’s Alright for Fighting”: The breakneck cuts from the delighted companionable giggling to the arguing to the dead silence serve as a portrait of Emily and Lorelai’s relationship in miniature. And Liza Weil has always been a treat as Paris, but she’s clearly reaching her peak as an actress now. It’s a joy to watch her viciously kick the bathroom door shut as she has her existential crisis  —   and Rory has always been at her most sweetly likable when she’s helping Paris through a meltdown.   16. ”Blame Booze and Melville” (season 5, episode 21) When Rory decides to steal a yacht because she feels sad, she is at her most unlikable. She is also at her most revealing. Rory Gilmore is the girl who internalized at a very young age the ideas that she wasn’t enough for her father to stick around for and that she was the reason her mother’s life went off the rails. She tried to compensate by being the angel child of Stars Hollow, on the grounds that if she were always perfect, everyone would love her and no one would leave her. Now, for the first time, she’s facing real, big, monumental failure, and she cannot handle it. She just collapses. It’s not likable, but it’s extremely compelling. 15. ”Teach Me Tonight” (season 2, episode 19) Rory and Jess are at their most entertainingly flirty when they go on their ice cream run. And their conversation here about their futures  —   Rory’s going to Harvard, Jess doesn’t plan on college  —   sets up the dynamic that allows Jess’s return in season six to feel earned: They’re both consistently good at seeing what the other person is capable of, and of telling them so in a way the other person can hear. 14. ”Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out” (season 6, episode 8) The introduction of Jess 2. 0: Now Not a Complete Shitshow is a compelling inverse of “Teach Me Tonight,” with   Jess telling defeatist Rory that she can do more than she’s allowing herself to. But regardless of who gives her that message, mostly it’s just satisfying to see Rory decide, once and for all, that she’s done being a passive little doll. 13. ”Lorelai’s Graduation Day” (season 2, episode 21) As Lorelai collects her business school diploma, after years of night classes, she looks out into the audience and sees Richard and Emily silently weeping. It’s a lovely, wistful moment that speaks to the family connection they can’t quite break. 12. ”Bon Voyage” (season 7, episode 22) The series finale is probably sweeter and gentler than anything   would have done, but damned if it doesn’t still work. It manages by relying almost exclusively on Lauren Graham and her marvelous expressiveness to carry everything. There’s the   on her face when Rory announces she’s about to leave home, and sorrow flickers behind her eyes before she covers it with pride and encouragement; there’s the look of loss when she sneaks into Rory’s bedroom to watch her sleep; and there’s her beautiful, simple delivery of the line, “It’s too soon. ” You feel everything Lorelai’s feeling. 11. ”Partings” (season 6, episode 22) In the Palladinos’ last episode before the revival, they indulge fully in their love of both   quirks and music geekery. (The troubadour battles! Yo La Tengo and Sonic Youth just wandering Stars Hollow!) They also indulge in their love of getting incredibly bleak. The opening and closing shots of Lorelai’s lost, broken face  —   as she realizes just how irrevocably her relationship with Luke has ended  —   are about as upsetting as this show ever gets.  The very best             *10. Fall (season 8, episode 4) The final episode of the show has a lot of ground to cover, and it doesn’t do all of it gracefully  —   Dean and Sookie’s cameos, especially, feel more like fan service than an organic part of the story that A Year in the Life was telling, and Emily’s ending feels troublingly like an afterthought. But the montage that makes up Luke and Lorelai’s wedding, with all its drapes and fairy lights and dancing girls, set to the song they danced to way back in season four, is one of the most purely beautiful and joyful moments of the entire show.  9. ”A House Is Not a Home” (season 5, episode 22) If the first five seasons are a long exercise in burrowing deep into the Gilmore family and uncovering all of its hidden dysfunctions, here’s where it all comes out to play. You can see Lorelai shut herself down as her parents inform her that Rory will be staying with them for the foreseeable future; it’s like she’s slamming a door behind her eyes. 8. ”Raincoats and Recipes” (season 4, episode 22) The original pitch for Gilmore Girls was, “What about a show about a mother and a daughter who are also best friends?” Here’s where we see that dynamic at its worst: Rory wants to talk to her best friend about losing her virginity, and Lorelai wants to show her daughter that she made a mistake by sleeping with a married man, and it all ends with Rory screaming, “I hate you for ruining this for me!” and sobbing on the porch. 7. ”Friday Night’s Alright for Fighting” (season 6, episode 13) This is the last of the really, really great Gilmore Girl episodes, purely on the basis of its final 10 minutes. It’s a kind of thesis statement for the show, as the camera jump cuts from the Gilmores screaming at each other to the Gilmores giggling together, again and again, until finally we end with Lorelai and Emily rehashing the fight they’ve been having since Lorelai first got pregnant. It’s perfect.  6. ”Rory’s Dance” (season 1, episode 9) And here’s the first of the really, really great Gilmore Girls episodes. Rory, in the first flush of her relationship with Dean, stays out all night with him (chastely) and our  central relationships implode. Emily is furious with Lorelai, and Lorelai is furious with Rory. This is the first time we see how much Lorelai’s relationship with Emily both threatens and defines her relationship with Rory, and how easily all of the betrayal and broken expectations Lorelai feels with Emily could spill over and curdle all the warmth and affection she feels with Rory. Those are the stakes of the show, and here’s where they first become clear.  *5. Summer (season 8, episode 3) A lot of the joy, warmth, and charm of Gilmore Girls is in Stars Hollow itself, so it’s not surprising that the revival reaches its peak with Stars Hollow: The Musical. From the creepy surrealism of the first songs (“You are like no other   Because you are my brother! ”) to the heartfelt beauty of the final song, which makes Lorelai dissolve into tears, it’s one of the great Gilmore Girls set pieces.  Additionally, Lorelai’s big fight with Rory makes the revival’s mission statement clear at last: This season is about deciding who gets to tell the family story. Emily was furious when Lorelai told the story of getting left behind in a trunk; now Lorelai is furious at the prospect of Rory telling the story of getting left behind in a bucket. The show’s gone Hamilton, and the big question is, “Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?” 4. ”Those Are Strings, Pinocchio” (season 3, episode 22) The season three finale has to close a lot of doors  —   on Chilton, on the Independence Inn, on Rory and Jess  —   and it does so incredibly gracefully. It has all the wistful melancholy mixed with warmth and hope of Gilmore Girls at its very best. 3. ”I Can’t Get Started” (season 2, episode 22) “I Can’t Get Started” hits a lot of the same tonal notes as “Those Are Strings, Pinocchio”  —   seasons two and three are a very close tonal match, both packed with sweet   charm and mild existential dread. But this one does it with just a little more sadness. Nothing that happens here is as bad as Rory moving in with her grandparents in season five or Lorelai deliberately torpedoing her own life in season six: Rory kisses Jess while she’s still with Dean, and Lorelai wants to get back together with Christopher, and then doesn’t. It’s small stakes. You know they’ll both be fine. But everything is handled with perfect, tender delicacy.  2. ”The Bracebridge Dinner” (season 2, episode 10) But the episodes that really capture what makes Gilmore Girls so joyous and warm are the ones where Rory and Lorelai come together with the rest of Stars Hollow in a giant   set piece. In “The Bracebridge Dinner,” as everyone comes to the Independence Inn for an aggressively historically inaccurate “period dinner,” we get to bask in the feeling of being part of this community. We know why Lorelai ended up here after she left her parents: It’s because Stars Hollow is a place of belonging. This is a show about family, and Stars Hollow is family on an enormous scale. 1. ”They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They?” (season 3, episode 7) What makes “They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They” the very best episode of all of Gilmore Girls is that it balances everything that makes this show great. You get the sense of community from all of Stars Hollow coming together for the dance marathon, and that incredibly joyful, vaguely Lynchian sequence of the whole town in their 1940s finery, boogying away on the dance floor at 6 am. There’s the romantic charge of Luke and Lorelai making eyes at each other over Lorelai’s shoe, and the    love triangle finally and dramatically coming to a head. And most importantly, you get the closeness and connection of Rory and Lorelai, literally leaning on each other for support as they try to make it through the day. The final shot, of a sobbing Rory collapsing into Lorelai’s arms as Kirk takes his   victory lap around them, is iconic for a reason: It captures the essence of Gilmore Girls.

" Every year, the National Book Foundation nominates 20 books  —   five fiction, five nonfiction, five poetry, five young adult  —   for the National Book Award, which celebrates the best of American literature. And every year (okay, every year since 2014) we here at Vox read all 20 finalists to help you smart, busy people figure out which ones you’re interested in. Our thoughts on the 2016 nominees are below, with the winners noted in bold.      Fiction  The Association of Small Bombs by Karan Mahajan              In The Association of Small Bombs, the small bombs of the title are bombs that kill only a few dozen people, bombs that don’t create any   outrage, bombs that are, as one character puts it, like a child throwing a tantrum, but “a tantrum directed at all things. ” And the small bombs are also the characters of the novel, all packed so full of pain and grief and guilt and rage and resentment that they are primed to explode at any moment.  In 1996, a bomb goes off in a marketplace in Delhi. It’s only a small bomb, but it kills, among others, two little boys. The friend who’s with them escapes with some shrapnel in his arm. Over the course of the book, we track the fallout from the explosion, watching as it slowly and steadily ruins the lives of the survivors, the victims’ families, and the perpetrators. “A good bombing,” Karan Mahajan writes, “begins everywhere at once,” and his book makes it clear that it also reverberates everywhere at once long after the initial explosion. Mahajan’s prose is elegant and incisive, his scope sweeping, and his sensibility cynically detached. Bleak and beautifully crafted, The Association of Small Bombs will stay with you.     —   Constance Grady  News of the World by Paulette Jiles              The elderly hero of News of the World, military Captain Jefferson Kidd, travels the dusty roads of Texas in 1870 to read newspapers aloud in meeting halls and taverns in small towns. Local politics during Reconstruction are deadly serious, so Kidd prefers to share news from further realms  —   Philadelphia, London, India, the Arctic  —   that takes place far enough away to seem, he says, like a fairy tale.     Like the news Kidd reads, News of the World itself has a   quality, set in a world where the Industrial Revolution hasn’t taken hold. Kidd is a veteran and widower whose life has recently begun to feel “thin and sour,” and he reluctantly agrees to take a    named Johanna, kidnapped by Kiowa Indians in a violent raid four years earlier, back to her aunt and uncle in San Antonio. Johanna has forgotten English and loved her Kiowa family; this makes her one of many captured children, Paulette Jiles tells us, who return to white society in body but not in spirit. It spoils nothing to say that as they travel through   terrain, Johanna and Kidd form a bond stronger than the barriers of age, language, and culture between them, and that Johanna’s companionship gives Kidd  —   an upright,   hero with a progressive soul  —   a newfound joy in life. We’ve seen this movie before.     But there is delight in a familiar story   and Jiles’s spare, sparkling prose is what elevates News of the World. Laden with details that never feel like exposition, it roots Kidd and Johanna’s journey in a specific time and place, a frontier past that is foreign yet familiar, diverse with a current of racial violence around the edges. There’s darkness running through this deceptively simple gem of a novel, but it’s enough of a fairy tale that you can’t help but hope for a happy ending.  —   Libby Nelson  The Throwback Special by Chris Bachelder              The Throwback Special is a football novel in the way that The Art of Fielding is a baseball novel  —   which is to say, it’s not, really. It’s about   American masculinity, and tribalism, and ritual. Football just provides the organizing premise. In 1985, Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor accidentally shattered Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann’s leg during a tackle, ending his career. Now, every year, 22 men come together to   the play that destroyed Theismann’s leg, in a ceremony that recalls a kind of ritual sacrifice. They stay in the same cheap hotel, choose their roles by the same elaborate lottery system, and rewatch the same footage of the play over and over again to prepare themselves. They also talk  —   about their failed marriages, their distant children, their disappointing careers.     Over the course of the book, the men blur into a solid mass of vague and seething discontent. They don’t matter all that much as characters; what matters is Chris Bachelder’s clean, precise prose, and the rambling philosophical digressions that punctuate the men’s rituals. You won’t care who Jeff is, but Jeff’s ideas about marriage  —   that its true purpose is to give you someone who will watch you, and who you must watch in return  —   are incredibly compelling.  —   Constance Grady  Another Brooklyn: A Novel by Jacqueline Woodson              This is memory, goes the frequent refrain in Another Brooklyn, the first adult novel in 20 years from Brown Girl Dreaming writer Jacqueline Woodson. This refrain captures the spirit of Woodson’s dreamlike prose, which verges on hallucinatory in its consideration of the   history of four black girls growing up in 1970s Brooklyn. As told through the scattered recollections of protagonist August  —   whose memories are   after an encounter with a childhood friend  —   Another Brooklyn dips in and out of time and place to weave a nonlinear    narrative. An evocative wisp of a novel, it could easily be called “a meditation” on many things: female friendship, black womanhood and sexuality, death and memory, religion and morality, societal pressure and expectations, and more. It’s a whole lot of book in a deceptively small package, nibbling on the corners of big ideas without swallowing them whole.     Related Jacqueline Woodson’s Another Brooklyn is a gauzy, lyrical fever dream of a book    Another Brooklyn is both withholding and generous, favoring evocative details and poetic language over more concrete  . That’s in keeping with the novel’s thematic fixation on the quality of memory, but also makes for a beguiling, fleeting reading experience that can feel like the words are slipping away as you read them. This is memory.  —   Genevieve Koski  The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead  —   WINNER              What’s most surprising about The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead’s hugely acclaimed novel about slaves seeking their freedom along the titular route, is what a page turner it is. Whitehead has always placed rich insight into the human condition right alongside more populist genre fare, but that he makes the flight of slaves into a genuine thriller, without sacrificing a sobering inquiry into a country that would allow an institution like slavery to exist for so long, is the novel’s greatest feat. But Whitehead doesn’t stop at “thriller. ” No, The Underground Railroad takes the form of a   picaresque  —   a   travel novel, featuring one character’s visits to several unlikely locales (think Gulliver’s Travels for an early version of the form). The protagonist is a woman named Cora whose journey on the Railroad is a literal one; trains come to underground stations to pick her up, and when she travels across state lines, she also subtly travels through time.    This lands her in worlds where black Americans have more opportunities and seem to have more freedom, worlds closely modeled on periods throughout the 20th century, and even in the world of the present. But at all times, slave catchers are on her trail, waiting to drag her back to the plantation to be punished for running.  Thus does Whitehead wed all of his best ideas together. Those in pursuit of Cora give the story the   pacing it needs, but they also represent the way that the legacy of slavery looms large in the American imagination, the way that it defines almost every interaction between white and black America to this day. It’s a potent, powerful idea, which Whitehead makes the best of at every turn. The structure of The Underground Railroad similarly sets it apart from other historical fictions. Whitehead spends most of his time in Cora’s head, but short interstitial chapters dance among the others who become important to her story, from a white woman who helps her hide and proves unexpectedly kind, to the fellow slave who convinces her to join him on his travels. But perhaps the most effective way Whitehead uses these shorter chapters is to explore the ways that white Americans could know  —   can still know  —   that slavery was a moral abomination, but also benefit from its existence, how they could keep from noticing the double exposure that was their lives by cropping out the unpleasant information. Or, as one slave catcher, reflecting on the American character, thinks: “Here was the true Great Spirit, the divine thread connecting all human endeavor  —   if you can keep it, it is yours. Your property, slave or continent. The American imperative. ”     —   Todd VanDerWerff Nonfiction  Strangers in Their Own Land by Arlie Russell Hochschild              Arlie Russell Hochschild’s prose reads so fluidly, you might forget you’re reading a work of sociology  —   but Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning in the American Right is as rigorously researched as it is carefully written, and the result is an imperative handbook for the Trump era and beyond. I can’t think of a book on the topic I’d recommend with more urgency.  Hochschild, a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, has won accolades and the respect of her peers for her previous books, including The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home and The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling. Curious about the rise of the Tea Party in 2011  —   in which she identified a phenomenon she called the “Great Paradox”  —   Hochschild went about connecting with Tea Party supporters in the Louisiana Bayou. Eventually, over five years, she began to probe what she termed the “deep story” that animates the populist movement on the right.      Related Arlie Hochschild on how America feels to Trump supporters    “A deep story is a    story,” writes Hochschild. “It’s the story feelings tell, in the language of symbols. ” Everyone has a deep story, she writes, and the subjects of her Tea Party research described a feeling that doubles as a metaphor: the feeling of being in line, moving toward the American Dream through hard work and right living, and then discovering that some people have been allowed to cut in front of you.   Strangers in Their Own Land’s greatest accomplishment as literature is this: Hochschild tells the deep story halfway through the book, only after allowing us to discover it through her conversation partners’ often startling life stories. Then, when she reiterates the deep story she’s discerned back to them, they affirm it, and we understand it, too.      Related What a liberal sociologist learned from spending five years in Trump’s America    As an academic comfortably rooted in her liberal hometown and beliefs, Hochschild is the ideal narrator for this book, which by nature is aimed at people like herself  —   educated coastal liberals  —   as well as moderates and conservatives who find themselves baffled by the rise of Trumpism. The book’s aim is not to convert people from one viewpoint to another. But as Hochschild comes to understand her friends in the bayou, seeing them as people rooted in place and beliefs that defy easy explanation and caricature, they start to see her the same way.   So in that way, Strangers in Their Own Land is both an argument for and an example of a kind of principled empathy, one that stays firm in its own convictions but also is unafraid of people who might appear to be enemies. It’s a rigorously researched story about understanding how many of the people we shout at and tweet about are much more like us than we might suspect. That example might just be the best hope for repairing America’s pluralism during the rough years ahead.       —   Alissa Wilkinson  Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America by Ibram X. Kendi  —   WINNER              A scholar of   history, Ibram X. Kendi kicks off this fiery book with equally fiery words from the past: an 1860 indictment from  . Jefferson Davis, later president of the Confederacy, that “this Government was not founded by negroes nor for negroes   …     but by white men for white men. ”  By foregrounding the overtness and literalism of historic racism in the US and abroad, and by using influential, prominent “tour guides” who he deems to be the most significant proponents of racist or   ideas in their day, Kendi is able to decisively quell the arguments that racism is a bygone byproduct of ignorance.  Time and again, powerful and brilliant men and women have produced racist ideas in order to justify the racist policies of their era, in order to redirect the blame for their era’s racial disparities away from those policies and onto Black people. Crucially, Kendi’s writing style is plainspoken,   and straightforward. He proceeds succinctly through broad swaths of history and the racist historical texts that accompany it. Paying close attention to cause and effect, he explains the way racist ideas arose and evolved out of economic, geographic, political, sociocultural,   moral convenience.  His tour guides  —   Puritan preacher Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, nominal abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W. E. B. DuBois, and modern activist Angela Davis  —   all represent evolving ways of alternately perpetuating, assuaging, or resisting racist ideas. All of them work to show how three distinct patterns of thought regarding racism have kept America’s civil rights in check for centuries.  The historical examples Kendi uses illustrate his argument that assimilationists  —   those who traditionally have sought a middle ground between abolitionists and segregationists  —   have done just as much as segregationists to advance the muddle of racist apologetics that make up modern American culture. The doublespeak of assimilationist thought has essentially screwed black resistance again and again: “If Blacks did not violently resist,” Kendi writes of Nat Turner and other   century slave rebels, “then they were cast as naturally servile. And yet, whenever they did fight, reactionary commentators, in both North and South, classified them as barbaric animals who needed to be caged in slavery. ”    Kendi admits that he is not writing to change the minds of those who produce and espouse racist ideas. Rather, in his honesty about how deeply he himself had held multiple racist ideas before embarking on the historical odyssey of this book, he gives the reader permission to accompany him on that   journey.  You may lose faith in many of your historical and literary heroes along the way  —   Jefferson in particular, whose support of slavery grew more firm over his lifetime as the economic profit he made from the institution grew. But in the midst of leaving Jefferson and his fellows open to judgment, Kendi leaves plenty of room for   and for drawing connections between the racist apologetics of the past and those of the present. The process makes for a compelling, thoroughly enlightening, unsettling, and necessary read.  —   Aja Romano  Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War by Viet Thanh Nguyen              After winning the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his 2015 novel The Sympathizer, Viet Thanh Nguyen uses his newest work to once again explore the identity crisis, both personal and cultural, associated with the Vietnam War. Like its subject, Nothing Ever Dies is many things at once: part memoir, part travelogue, part history lesson, part philosophical musing, and part a prescient   call to anyone seeking to wrap their head around the state of current global politics.  By taking the reader on a sweeping and sobering global tour of artifacts, places, art, texts, and monuments associated with Vietnam, Nguyen argues that our cultural need to reflect accurately upon our history and fully absorb its lessons is forever at war with the impossibility of ever fully knowing the truth, or retelling it accurately. The American understanding of the Vietnam War requires an Orwellian double consciousness: an awareness of the Vietnam War as it happened and as we have culturally reframed it. The former picture is of a devastating, bloody war of attrition, a flexing of the US’s imperialist muscle against Communism. The latter picture, Nguyen argues, is one of heroic valor that united men across racial and class lines in battle, with that unification ultimately justifying America’s involvement in the conflict. Cautioning that we cannot remember what we do not see, he lists the ways in which the US has failed to fully recognize its own role in Vietnam, let alone the Vietnamese citizens it ostensibly went to Vietnam to protect. The US memory of Vietnam, he says, “substitutes   thousand American soldiers for three million Vietnamese,” as well as Cambodians, Laotians, and South Koreans.     He outlines  —   systematically and with clear, graceful prose  —   the many facets of “memory” that paradoxically complicate our attempts to remember Vietnam. He is patient, thorough, and meticulous in his attempt to explain the process and elements through which we normalize the spectacle of war and alternately humanize and demonize various parties. This work is deep and difficult, but it comes with countless revelations, such as when Nguyen describes the ultimate irony of nationalism’s hatred for identity politics: “Nationalism is nothing more than an identity politics so triumphant that it can deny being about identity and politics, as nationalists accept both national identity and national politics as being simply natural. ” It’s fitting that Nothing Ever Dies has emerged at a moment when the US and most of Europe are fiercely questioning America’s ability to reconcile with the past. Nguyen might say that the only way we can truly acknowledge the past is to contend with how fallible our memories actually are.  —   Aja Romano  The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America by Andrés Reséndez              If you’re a reasonably woke student of the American past, you probably know that the United States has two original sins: slavery and the treatment of Native Americans. The thesis of The Other Slavery: The Undercovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America is in part that these stories and sins are not separate at all, that they are one and the same, and that the enslavement of American Indians from the 16th century onward had a lasting effect that didn’t die with the passage of the 13th Amendment. Andrés Reséndez, a history professor at the University of California Davis, has written a marshaling of damning facts and figures about enslavement and resistance that stretch back to Christopher Columbus. He spares few details in laying out the way the “other slavery” functioned, from the justifications used to reconcile slavery with Catholicism in the 16th century to the maneuvers used to preserve slavery in later centuries by basing it on economics, such as debt peonage.  The Other Slavery is a rigorous, academic work  —   it’s here to deliver a sweeping history, not to tell a single story  —   but it’s clearly and precisely written. It’s the kind of book that changes how you understand your country and its history. Human trafficking is sometimes referred to as “modern slavery”; Reséndez’s work proves it’s no more modern than the   kind.     —   Libby Nelson   Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy by Heather Ann Thompson              Journalists like to think of themselves as the writers of “the first draft of history. ” But powerful people have an interest in making sure the truth stays hidden, and sometimes not even the most assiduous journalist can get through.  The rebellion that overtook the Attica Correctional Facility in New York in 1971  —   and lasted for four days before state police and prison guards retook the prison in a horrific massacre  —   isn’t well understood by the public, because the state of New York spent four decades keeping it that way. Heather Ann Thompson’s book, then, is history as the first draft of history. The result is a masterpiece of narration. Thompson spent years doing archival research and amassing sources, but Blood in the Water doesn’t feel like she’s laboring to pull it all together. Reading it feels like walking across a glacier: You can glide along without thinking, but when you do stop to think, you can barely fathom how far down it goes.  The pacing is cinematic: first a war movie, then a courtroom drama. I can’t describe a book that turned my stomach the way this one did as “entertaining,” but it was a deeply satisfying read.  Thompson takes a very light critical hand through most of the book  —   which means it’s not thickly spread with analysis throughout. But that’s for the best. This is not a book you should read to gain insight into our present moment; it’s a book you should read to become a better citizen, teaching yourself about an injustice people spent a long time trying to hide from you.  —   Dara Lind Poetry  The Performance of Becoming Human by Daniel Borzutzky  —   WINNER              The second most bleak thing about The Performance of Becoming Human is the way it renders our world as an Orwellian dystopia, all tortured political prisoners and corrupt capitalist bureaucrats. The most bleak thing is that it considers itself to be complicit in that dystopia.    In Daniel Borzutzky’s world, there is no such thing as pure, redemptive, transformative art. Poets, like apes learning to be human, “lunge and growl and snort and belch” as “ethnic avant garde poems drop from their prickly mouths. ” Poetry is a commodity, a performative pose, a useful and unremarkable fixture of the great and monstrous social machine, and so is everything else: “the   poems absorb themselves then regenerate into billions of the blankest verses there ever were. ”  Borzutsky’s language is purposefully rough, even ugly; he stays away from anything that might be described as lyrical. That deliberate roughness gives lines like this their force and power: The sentences are collapsing one by one and the bodies are collapsing in your bloody  hands and you stitch me up and pray I will sleep and you tell me of the shattered bus stops where the refugees are waiting for the buses to take them to the mall where they are holding us now and there is a man outside our bodies making comments about perspective and scale and light and there is light once more in your bloody fingers. The repetitive clauses and the bloody images build upon each other relentlessly, creating a world in which we are all complicit and from which there is no escape and no redemption. The Performance of Becoming Human is not an easy book to read, but it is a powerful one.  —   Constance Grady  Look by Solmaz Sharif              Look is surprisingly tender for a book of such ferocious poetry. Solmaz Sharif is the daughter of Iranian immigrants, and in her debut poetry collection, she meditates on her family’s experiences in America’s surveillance state, the family members who died in the   War, and the ripple effects of America’s wars in the Middle East. “It matters what you call a thing,” she insists, as she methodically dismantles the Defense Department’s Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms. Most tender and most lyrical of all is “Personal Effects,” the   poem Sharif wrote about her uncle’s death in the   War. “I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it,” the poem begins, and as it continues Sharif examines all the ways in which writing about her uncle become a way of learning to ignore him all over again.    The project of this book is to struggle against the way the vocabulary of war distances itself from the violence of war, but as Sharif writes, she finds herself only creating more distance. And so she throws herself back toward the reality of her uncle and his death, struggling to reach it, until at last she arrives only at the physical reality of her uncle’s name:  Amoo, I think. Amoo. The word a moan  a blown kiss the soft things it makes a mouth do. Amoo, I thought  It matters what you call a thing, and in refusing to separate the memory of her uncle from his name, Sharif shows just how much it matters. This approach is what makes Look such a deeply human attempt to rewrite the vocabulary of war.   —   Constance Grady  Archeophonics by Peter Gizzi               Air, trees, light, and time  —   these fundamental elements fill Peter Gizzi’s book of poetry, which is dedicated to the mind and the language we use to try to capture the world. (“Indicative transitive particular battles the void. ”) This volume’s title, Archeophonics, is a word not in the dictionary. But it would translate roughly to the “old language,” which Gizzi writes of many times, or perhaps to ancient speech sounds. He does indeed play with sound. Sometimes, he creates   arrangements that make one stumble. Sometimes, he invents words. (“Furlight” and “ ” are now following me around.)    Throughout the volume is an undercurrent of uncertainty and aging: “was it wind or a creature   am I here or is it over. ” And when things come together just right, Gizzi creates some truly extraordinary moments, expertly describing mental states that cannot be defined with typical language:  “Today was the day of the amphitheater in mind.   The day of a dreaming speech where the light is dope and that’s all you can say.   When a feeling degrades and evolves into thought like 2AM dilated, revealed a star  …    ”  —   Susannah Locke  Collected Poems: 1974 —  2004 by Rita Dove              This   tome collects seven books by one of the US’s most accomplished poets  —   and what a volume it is. Over her long career, Rita Dove has racked up a bevy of awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and the Fulbright Lifetime Achievement Medal.   Her   work covers topics from personal tales to national history and other cultural touchstones. She treats with equal thoughtfulness the Greek myth of Persephone and a   glass of water. I’m a sucker for a good simile, and she crafts them in abundance. So here’s my list of the 11 best similes in Rita Dove’s Collected Poems:      “When you appeared it was as if   magnets cleared the air” (p. 15) “The camels stand in all their vague beauty  —     at night they fold up like pale accordions. ” (p. 51) “The slap   of flesh onto flesh, a   liquid crack like a grape   as it breaks on the tongue. ” (p. 71) “the pruning shears   a mammoth claw resting   between meals” (p. 92) “work is a narrow grief   and the music afterwards   is like a woman   reaching into his chest   to spread it around . .. ” (p. 120) “She can think up a twilight, sulfur   flicking orange then black   as the tip of a flamingo’s wing  …    ” (p. 150) “they dropped excrement as daintily   as handkerchieves . .. ” (p. 151) “  …    moon riding the sky   like a drop of oil on water  …    ” (p. 173) “We turn inland as if turning a page in a novel:   dry splash of the cicada, no breath from the sea. ” (p. 274) “There were equations elegant as a French twist,   fractal geometry’s unwinding maple leaf  …    ” (p. 296) “In Willendorf   twilight is brutal: no dim tottering   across flowery fields but blindness   dropped into the treeline like an ax. ” (p. 310)   —   Susannah Locke  The Abridged History of Rainfall by Jay Hopler              This is an intimate, personal, elegiac collection. Jay Hopler is writing about his response to his father’s death, and his struggle to deal with the rawness of his own grief when he sees it next to beauty  —   of the natural world or of his own poetry. “It’s my father, for the love of Christ!” Hopler writes in “The Pallbearer. ” His father is dead, and it seems vaguely offensive for the moon to still be present and beautiful, “a   gleaming sequin,” in the face of his grief. But the moon rises anyway  —   “that pushy, pushy   Moon”  —   and that is something we all just have to deal with.  At times, he seems as offended by the beauty of his own language as he is by the beauty of the world around him. He wants to tear it into shreds, but he can’t find a way. And so his father’s eulogy is titled “Eulogy (Currently in Revision)” and is followed by “Meditation on a Poem Currently in Revision,” which quietly negates the glorious, flamboyant imagery of the earlier poem, filling it with death: “No rogue Ferris wheel   Shrieking down streets   Warm with corpses. ” But as much as Hopler pushes against the beauty of his language, it is always there, sometimes betraying and sometimes redeeming, but always insisting on the force and reality of his grief.  —   Constance Grady Young People’s Literature  The Sun Is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon              In The Sun Is Also a Star, Nicola Yoon (Everything, Everything) pits the poetic against the pragmatic in an interrogation of the idea of love at first sight. Given that Yoon’s author bio states she “firmly believes that you can fall in love in an instant,” it may seem like the book’s ultimate stance on the matter is a fait accompli. However, The Sun Is Also a Star tugs on so many threads over the course of its   story that its conclusion winds up being far from neat. Yoon’s central teenage lovers are the definition of  : Daniel is the romantic,   son of striving Korean immigrants who run a black   shop and expect their son to become a doctor;   Natasha is Jamaican, brought to the US illegally by her parents when she was a child, and her family is facing imminent deportation unless she can somehow change their fate. The Sun Is Also a Star uses as its organizing principle the   Interpretation, suggesting that Nicola and Daniel’s meeting is the result of a series of small, unknowable variables that coincided perfectly to bring them together. As such, it frequently steps outside of its central narrative  —   which sees Nicola and Daniel trading    recollections of their day together  —   to examine these variables in short chapters that consider the people (an immigration attorney) and situations (Korean immigrants’ monopoly on the black   industry) that have informed Daniel and Natasha’s trajectory toward one another.  This look at the universe surrounding Daniel and Natasha’s whirlwind romance enlivens The Sun Is Also a Star, turning what could have been a standard Romeo and Juliet riff into a thoughtful, frank, and frequently beautiful consideration of how love is affected by fate, family, culture, society, and countless other factors we can only begin to imagine.   —   Genevieve Koski  Raymie Nightingale by Kate DiCamillo              “Oh, my goodness,” said Louisiana. “I’m just all filled up with feathers and regrets. ” In some ways, this lyrical novel by veteran young adult author Kate DiCamillo is about failed hopes, waylaid plans, and how we cope with grief and loss; but it’s also about the unexpected moments of bonding and friendship that arise in between all the plans we don’t get around to carrying out.  The year is 1975, and Raymie Nightingale has decided to enter and win the Little Miss Central Florida Tire contest as a way to get her father to   her and her mother. Her plan immediately goes awry, starting with the two other girls she meets on day one of her awkward baton practice in preparation for the talent competition. Louisiana and Beverly each have their own urgent reasons for wanting to win the pageant; but when the three girls decide to help each other succeed, their plans carry them into entirely new adventures.  Raymie Nightingale is noticeably thin on plot compared to DiCamillo’s other novels, like Because of  . Instead, the joy of this book is in its characters, and in DiCamillo’s lush, effervescent writing. Her creations are perfect portraits of children who balance their innocence and abundance of hope with a premature awareness of pain and loss. Raymie’s narrative point of view deliberately glances off issues of poverty, family dysfunction, abuse, and animal cruelty as the girls sidestep the harsh reality of their lives. Together, they weave a thread of magical realism into their adventures, a contagion that spreads until you want to believe in their fairy tale.    —   Aja Romano  Ghost by Jason Reynolds              With his vivid voice and straightforward narratives of city life, author Jason Reynolds has drawn frequent comparisons to late, great young adult writer Walter Dean Myers. Like Myers, Reynolds writes books that can immediately hook young and reluctant readers with their authenticity  —   the language of someone who’s been in their shoes. In Ghost, the first of a   series that will look at the stories of track team members, we meet Castle Cranshaw, a. k. a. Ghost, a   who’s able to outrun everything except his own anger.  Ghost has every reason in the world to be angry  —   most notably at his father’s attempt years earlier to kill Ghost and his mother, who narrowly escaped by running for their lives. With his father in jail, Ghost has since shared his mother’s financial hardships, endured bullying from classmates, and kept largely to himself. Though he doesn’t spell it out for readers, his nickname refers as much to invisibility as it does to the specter of fear that haunts him after the trauma of that terrifying night. Ghost is so busy trying (and failing) to keep his head down that he hasn’t had a chance to explore his true potential  —   but there’s one thing he knows he can do, thanks to that night, and that’s run. When he impulsively crashes a community track team practice, he’s not prepared for the beckoning world of community, friendship, and responsibility offered to him by the team and its kind but firm coach. His story from there follows predictable lines, but is saved from feeling clichéd by virtue of Reynolds’s sleek, clean writing and his   empathy for all his subjects.  One of the unspoken tensions of Reynolds’s novel is that the past and present are constantly colliding to threaten Ghost’s future. Ghost is so preoccupied with his life from moment to moment that he can’t possibly internalize the larger consequences and potential downsides of his choices in the long run; but we can, and so can the adults around him. Reynolds avoids allowing his plot to devolve into either sentimentality or melodrama by refusing to outline a broader happy ending for this tale and the characters in it. Instead, he positions readers so narrowly in Ghost’s point of view that we feel like we’re running the track with him  —   with all the ghosts of his past at our heels.   —   Aja Romano  When the Sea Turned to Silver by Grace Lin              When the Sea Turned to Silver is a   and companion to Grace Lin’s bestselling When the Mountain Meets the Moon. Both books are works of fantasy and magical realism inspired by Chinese folklore; both are hero’s journeys woven from a rich tapestry of folk tales. But where the earlier novel’s quest was born out of hope, When the Sea Turned to Silver heroine Pinmei’s quest is born out of urgency and political upheaval in her small town. Pinmei has always lived with her grandmother, a renowned storyteller, in peace in their quiet village; but that changes when a new emperor ascends to power. One night, Pinmei’s grandmother is captured by the emperor in hopes she can help him locate the mystical Luminous Stone that Lights the Night. To bargain for her grandmother’s life, Pinmei and her odd friend Yishan go on a quest to find the stone themselves. Along the way, the strangers they meet request to hear the stories Pinmei’s grandmother has taught them, and each one bears a strange resemblance to the present.  With every story, the past converges with the present, and mythical creatures converge with the characters around them, until it becomes clear that the stories themselves are guiding Pinmei and Yishan through their adventure, providing the answers that will help Pinmei find the stone, defeat the emperor, and save her grandmother  —   and perhaps the entire kingdom as well. The genius of Lin’s narrative, the stories that wind around and through one another, is that with each passing tale, we can discern Pinmei finding her own voice. She progresses from a halting, tremulous wallflower to a confident storyteller to rival her legendary grandmother. Rich with vivid imagery and symbolism,   illustrations, and graceful, deceptively simple prose, When the Sea Turned to Silver reminds us that we need the stories of the past to light the way for us in the present.   —   Aja Romano  March: Book Three by John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell  —   WINNER              Congress member John Lewis, who led the House   for gun regulation this summer, is the last living member of the Big Six of the civil rights movement. That makes him more or less the closest thing America has to a real live superhero, and March is his origin story. March is a trilogy of graphic memoirs that tell the story of Lewis’s time in the civil rights movement with storytelling assistance from Andrew Aydin and vivid and visceral illustrations by Nate Powell. The trilogy spans the early Woolworth   up through Bloody Sunday, when nonviolent protesters were beaten by police officers as they tried to march to Selma.     Related John Lewis was the hero of the House  . This comic book tells his origin story.    With the March books, Lewis has become a cult sensation on the Comic Con circuit. He’ll show up cosplaying as his younger self, with trench coat, cap, and a backpack full of all the supplies he carried in case he got arrested and had to spend the night in jail: two books, an apple, a toothbrush, and toothpaste.  Book Three, the final volume, is the darkest of the March trilogy, starting with the Birmingham church bombings and climaxing with Bloody Sunday itself. “I thought I was going to die,” says Lewis in one unforgettable panel, in a pool of his own blood, as police officers swing their batons around him.  —   Constance Grady  Correction: An early version of this article said that the National Book Award winners would be announced on November 15.

" When a Baltimore police shift commander created an arrest form for loitering on public housing, he didn’t even try to hide his racist expectations. In the template, there was no space to fill in gender or race. Instead, that information was automatically filled out: “black male. ”    This attitude was not exclusive to one cop in Baltimore. A Justice Department investigation conducted in 2015 and 2016 found black people in Baltimore were much more likely to be stopped than their white counterparts even after controlling for population. One black man in his   was stopped 30 times in less than four years  —   nearly one stop a month  —   despite never receiving a citation or criminal charge. And these were just some of the many alarming findings of racial bias in the Baltimore Police Department that were unearthed by the Justice Department’s investigation. By the end of it all, the Justice Department found Baltimore police consistently violated at least three amendments in the US Constitution  —   the First, Fourth, and 14th  —   and engaged repeatedly and persistently in a pattern of racial bias.           The tyranny of a traffic ticket: How small crimes turn fatal for poor, minority Americans   “Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD’s enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force,” the report concluded. “These racial disparities, along with evidence suggesting intentional discrimination, erode the community trust that is critical to effective policing. ”    It would be one thing if this were just a particularly bad police department in the US. But when you zoom out to look at all the investigations the Justice Department has done over the past several years, typically after protests ignite due to a police shooting perceived as unjust, a pattern emerges: Whether it’s Baltimore; Cleveland; New Orleans; Ferguson, Missouri; or, most recently, Chicago, the Justice Department has found horrific constitutional violations in how police use force, how they target minority residents, how they stop and ticket people, and virtually every other aspect of policing. These issues come up time and time again, no matter the city that federal investigators look at.    One is left with just one possible conclusion: Policing in America is broken. Many Americans seem well aware of this: The statistics show that many simply don’t trust the very people who are supposed to protect them. But there are essentially two worlds  —   black and white  —   for police trust.     A 2016 Pew Research Center survey found, for instance, that black people are less than half as likely to trust the police as their white counterparts. When asked whether police treat racial and ethnic groups equally, 75 percent of white people said cops do an excellent or good job in this area, while just 35 percent of black people said the same. And 75 percent of white people said police do a good or excellent job using the right amount of force for each situation, while just 33 percent of black people did. Meanwhile, statistics show police are arguably failing to protect residents in black communities: While black people made up about 13 percent of the population in 2015, they made up more than half of reported murder victims. Thomas Abt, a criminologist at Harvard University, put it in stark terms: “In addition to all of these burdens that we’re placing on   communities in terms of aggressive policing, we’re fundamentally failing them at keeping them safe. ”    So I set out to find out how, exactly, policing in America can be fixed. I spoke to nine veteran policing and criminal justice experts across the country, with a focus on the big question: How should police and lawmakers address complaints of racial bias while making sure communities are effectively policed for crime? Based on what I heard from experts, I nailed down eight big policy ideas. These ideas could be done even under a Trump administration that fashions itself as “tough on crime”; almost all policing is done at the local and state, not federal, level  —   out of the nearly 18, 000 law enforcement agencies in America, only a dozen or so are federal. And the ideas are not in any specific order, but experts consistently said that nothing else will work if the first step on this list isn’t fully embraced by law enforcement across the US. 1) Police need to apologize for centuries of abuse            Time and time again, I heard the same thing from several experts: Until police own up to how minority communities view them, they won’t be able to effectively police their communities.  Some police officers might feel many of the criticisms are unfair. Some might hear about the history of police being used on slave patrols, and feel that they are wrongly blamed for things they weren’t even alive for. Some might feel that they are good cops, and it’s only a few officers who are bad. But that doesn’t matter. The reality is minority communities distrust police. That sentiment is based on a long history of   racist policing in America, even if it doesn’t apply to every single officer or department today. Until police acknowledge that, they will be perceived by many people as trying to cover up a long history of oppression. David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College, argued that there will always be distrust between police and black communities until cops own up to historical abuses, mimicking what a police chief might say to a community: “We recognize these facts  —   whether we were there or not, whether we were around during slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, attacks on the civil rights movement, or whether it’s more recent things that we have done that you have found disrespectful and untoward, like   policing and high levels of stop and frisk. ”    “In order to overcome lack of trust and confidence, the police have to make contact” So how can police repair this? For one, experts said police need to undertake a big effort  —   through community meetings, going door to door, their daily patrols, and TV appearances  —   to get their communities aligned with how policing should be done. “In order to overcome lack of trust and confidence, the police have to make contact  —         contact  —   with members of their community,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. “The police will be rebuffed on occasion, but that’s the only way I see to, in the long run, rebuild trust or, really, build it for the first time in the police in members of these communities. ” Walter Katz, a California attorney who specializes in oversight of law enforcement agencies, likened the potential process to South Africa’s   Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Throughout those hearings, investigators spoke candidly with the victims and enforcers of apartheid about what happened. Much of the hearings were televised. In doing this, people not only got to air their grievances and see their concerns heard, but plans were also set in place  —   including reparations  —   to help undo the damage that had been done. Above all, the point is to let communities know that police hear them, are taking what they say seriously, and are planning further steps to address their complaints. 2) Cops should be trained to address their racial biases            Out of all the complaints leveled against the police, the biggest one in recent years  —   echoed by the Black Lives Matter movement  —   is that police are racially biased. Sometimes the cause is explicit racism  —   such as in North Miami Beach, Florida, where police officers used mug shots of black people as target practice. But other times, such biases may occur at the implicit level, where people’s subconscious biases guide their choices even when they’re not fully aware of it.    Josh Correll, a University of Colorado Boulder psychology professor, tested police for racial biases through a shooting simulation. His initial findings showed officers generally did a good job of avoiding shooting unarmed targets of all races. But when shooting was warranted, officers pulled the trigger more quickly against black suspects than white ones. This suggests that officers exhibit some racial bias in shooting. In the real world, this could lead police to shoot black people at disproportionate rates. Real policing situations, after all, are often much more complicated: Factors  —   such as a real threat to the officer’s life and the chance that a bullet will miss and accidentally hit a passerby  —   can make the situation much more confusing to officers. “In the very situation in which [officers] most need their training,” Correll previously told me, “we have some reason to believe that their training will be most likely to fail them. ” That’s one of the reasons there are racial disparities in police use of force: An analysis of the available FBI data from 2012 by Vox’s Dara Lind found black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population.            It’s not just individual biases driving the disparities, but structural problems as well. As a result of years and years of racial segregation, economic and educational inequality among people of different races, concentrated poverty in minority communities, and the criminal justice system’s neglect of crimes against minorities, there tends to be much more crime in black neighborhoods. So police are deployed more often in these areas, where they’re then more likely to shoot and kill someone. But higher crime in minority communities doesn’t fully explain the disparities. A 2015 study by researcher Cody Ross found “there is no relationship between   racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even   crime rates). ” That suggests something else  —   such as, potentially, racial bias  —   is at work.     Phillip Atiba Goff, a criminal justice and racial bias expert at John Jay College, told me, this isn’t about whether officers are all evil racists. Instead, this is a bias that has been found time and time again in just about everyone. If you are a human being, chances are you have some level of bias  —   based on race, gender, religion, and so on. But American media and culture, with their constant depictions of black people as criminals, have shaped Americans’ biases into consistently associating black people with criminality. “The issue of police bias starts with the thing law enforcement is hiring, which is that they hire humans,” Goff said. “They end up being at least as biased as the rest of the population. And in some instances, I suspect, it may be even slightly more in terms of racial bias. ” For police, the bias can be particularly bad: They are constantly put in situations where they have to think quickly. And that makes it much more likely that their biases will take over. As Goff told me, “If I could put you in the right situation, I could get that particular association to lend itself to certain kinds of behaviors. ” Officers can be trained to help combat their biases. Lorie Fridell, a University of South Florida criminologist who works with cops to help them resist their biases, previously explained that cops can be taught to force themselves to focus on factors that aren’t skin color  —   such as body language and what a person is holding. Unfortunately, that training is rarely emphasized by police departments.  A 2006 report from the Justice Department found that police officers typically receive about 111 hours on firearms skill and    —   but just 11 on cultural diversity and human relations, eight on community policing strategies, and eight on mediation and conflict management.            This doesn’t speak just to how little police are trained to handle racial biases, but also all sorts of other situations they take part in  —   mental health crises, interactions with the LGBTQ community, and domestic and sexual abuse cases, as a few examples. Cops just aren’t   to handle a wide variety of sensitive, difficult areas.    If police want to renew community trust, this needs to change. It likely wouldn’t solve all problems  —   racial bias, for one, is likely to be present to some degree no matter how well cops are trained. But it would help. 3) Police should avoid situations that lead them to use force            Often, the error that leads to an unnecessary shooting  —   and perhaps bias as a driving factor of the excessive force  —   comes long before an officer pulls out his or her gun. It can happen when an officer decides to approach a scene in a certain way. Think of the final moments of before a Cleveland police officer shot and killed    Tamir Rice in 2014. In that tragedy, officers suspected that Rice, who was black, had an actual firearm, when he was in fact playing with a toy gun. And officers drove right into the park where Rice was playing, shooting the boy within two seconds of getting out of their squad car. What if officers had, instead of driving into the scene, parked further away, surveyed the area, and walked into the park more slowly, while giving warnings to Rice? It’s of course impossible to say what the outcome would be  —   but it certainly seems much more likely that Rice would be alive today. “We talk about the   decisions that have to be made when deadly force is used, and it’s a red herring,” Goff said. “Most of the time, [police] are not ambushed in a corner and then they have to figure out what to do. Most of the time, what happens is there are a number of tactical decisions you’ve made up until that point that have compromised your safety. ”    “We have to be able to acknowledge and identify the set of situations that are most likely to facilitate biased behavior” So if officers have racial biases, and you put them in an intense situation in which they have little to call on but their own biases, those biases are going to guide their actions. “We have to be able to acknowledge and identify the set of situations that are most likely to facilitate biased behavior,” Goff said. “And we want to be able to disarm or interrupt them. ” Goff gave an example from research work he did in Las Vegas. There, police established a foot pursuit policy that said the officer who was giving chase should not be the first person to put their hands on the suspect, with coordinated backup instead arriving on the scene and taking on that role. The idea is that foot pursuits often ended in excessive use of force  —   after all, they are   chases in which the officer and the suspect can get really angry, really fast. So by limiting, when possible, chasing officers from putting their hands on the suspect, Goff figured you could limit use of force. The change appeared to work. There was a 23 percent reduction in total use of force and 11 percent reduction in officer injury over several years, on top of reducing racial disparities, according to Goff. “Safer for the officer, safer for the suspects,” he said. “I didn’t have to talk about race to reduce a disparity that has racial components to it,” he added. “I had to change the fundamental situation where police are chronically engaging with suspects. And that’s the kind of example that I’m talking about how you interrupt the biases of life. ” This is just one example. More broadly, police need to stop being deployed in a way that is particularly aggressive against minority communities  —   such as when cops in New York City effectively targeted people of color and their whole communities through “stop and frisk. ” As Jonathan Blanks, a research associate focused on policing issues at the Cato Institute, told me, “So long as you have [racially disparate policing strategies] you can have all these ideas about how we’re going to measure how many black people we stop and reduce bias there, but I don’t think it’s really going to work. ”  4) Officers must be held accountable in a very transparent way            With the above steps, police can avoid more unnecessary uses of force. But there’s another problem: When police do use excessive force or engage in other types of misconduct, there needs to be more transparency and accountability in the aftermath.    The most   policy for this is the adoption of body cameras. Over the past couple of years, advocates have pushed police departments to equip all their cops with cameras that will record nearly every move. The cameras are crucial because video can help eliminate some of the doubt  —   for the police and civilians  —   as to what happened in, for example, a shooting.  Take the 2015 police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina. An officer, Michael Slager, claimed that Scott had tried to take his stun gun and use it on him before fleeing. Video footage from a civilian at the scene, however, revealed that Scott had not tried to grab Slager’s stun gun, and Slager had shot at Scott’s back as the    black man very slowly attempted to flee. And after the shooting, Slager then planted the stun gun near Scott’s dead body  —   presumably to give his story credibility. If the cellphone video from the passerby didn’t exist, would Slager have been charged with murder and civil rights violations? Would he have been fired? Would he have gotten away with a totally unjustified shooting? After all, without video, witness testimony may have been limited to Slager’s own account.     Beyond changing the gear that officers wear, some experts argued that police leaders need to embrace a fundamental shift in accountability and transparency. As it stands, police departments are mired in secrecy  —   making it nearly impossible in some cases to find out if an officer has, for example, been disciplined in the past. In a 2015 investigation, Robert Lewis, Noah Veltman, and Xander Landen of the New York public radio station WNYC talked to attorneys and experts in all 50 states and Washington, DC, and reviewed laws and court cases to find out which states restrict police disciplinary records. They found that 23 states and DC make the records confidential. And 15 other states limit access to records by, for example, only letting the public see examples of severe discipline, such as suspension or termination. The remaining 12 states generally open police disciplinary records to the public.       (function()  ; if( typeof( pym) === ’undefined’)   else   })();   Much of this secrecy is ingrained in police culture. The “blue wall of silence” tells cops to stay quiet about other officers’ misconduct. This code is enforced both formally and informally. In Baltimore, for example, the Justice Department found a black sergeant was told to “stay in your lane” when he tried to flag misconduct within the police: In 2014, a BPD lieutenant placed several signs next to the desk of an   sergeant with a reputation for speaking out about alleged misconduct in the Department. Among the signs were warnings to ”stay in your lane,” ”worry about yourself,” ”mind your own business! !” and ”don’t spread rumors! !!” After the sergeant filed a complaint about the signs, the lieutenant admitted to creating them and placing them next to the sergeant’s desk. Yet BPD took no meaningful corrective action. Though the complaint was sustained, the lieutenant received no suspension, fine, or loss of benefits.  To fix this, then, some experts argue that a fundamental shift in leadership is needed. “The work that needs to be done certainly involves progressive leadership,” said Thomas Nolan, a Boston police veteran and criminologist at Merrimack College of Massachusetts. “We’ve seen, unfortunately, too little of that. We seem to see the same types of people  —   and there are exceptions  —   being put in chief executive positions in police departments across the country. ” Policing in America, particularly at the leadership level, tends to be quite insular. For example, William Bratton served as the police commissioner in Boston in the early 1990s, commissioner in New York City in the   chief in Los Angeles in the 2000s, and finally as commissioner again in New York City from 2014 to 2016. Anthony Batts similarly served as police chief in Oakland and Long Beach, California, before moving to the Baltimore Police Department from 2012 to 2015. There are many more similar examples in big and   cities’ police departments. Nolan’s argument is simple: If the same people tend to be in charge of police agencies, how can we expect them to change to be more transparent?    5)    incentives for police officers need to change            As part of changing the culture of transparency and accountability, several experts also argued that the incentives many police departments across the country impose on their officers need to change. The most commonly cited example comes from Ferguson, Missouri  —   where Michael Brown’s death by police in 2014 effectively launched the modern Black Lives Matter protests. The Justice Department investigated the Ferguson Police Department as a result of the protests. It found that police were encouraged to ticket as many people as possible with the explicit goal of raising as much revenue as possible from fines and fees. But to do this, police targeted the most vulnerable  —   mainly, black residents  —   with frivolous charges. The Justice Department cited one example: Officers frequently arrest individuals under Section  (1) on facts that do not meet the provision’s elements. Section  (1) makes it unlawful to ”[f]ail to comply with the lawful order or request of a police officer in the discharge of the officer’s official duties where such failure interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance of such duties.” Many cases initiated under this provision begin with an officer ordering an individual to stop despite lacking objective indicia that the individual is engaged in wrongdoing. The order to stop is not a ”lawful order” under those circumstances because the officer lacks reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.   …     Nonetheless, when individuals do not stop in those situations, FPD officers treat that conduct as a failure to comply with a lawful order, and make arrests. This is not exclusive to Ferguson. In New York City, a group of police officers tried to sue the city and police department over a “quota” to stop and arrest as many people as possible. Some officers acknowledged that officers met this incentive by targeting   black neighborhoods with little political power. “When you put any type of numbers on a police officer to perform, we are going to go to the most vulnerable,” Adhyl Polanco, one of the New York City police officers, told WNBC. “We’re going to [the] LGBT community, we’re going to the black community, we’re going to go to those people that have no boat, that have no power. ”    Experts say that police can still be incentivized for productivity, but that can be done without focusing so much on specific numbers of arrests or traffic tickets. It can be done in a more subjective manner through direct supervision. It can also be coupled with other types of data, such as the number of complaints leveled at an officer and how many times a particular cop used force. But the bottom line is police need to be aware of how strict quotas and incentives can lead officers astray  —   and take steps to correct any of those unwanted side effects. 6) We need higher standards for police  —   and better pay for cops            Who becomes a police officer likely needs to change, as well  —   by setting a higher bar for who can qualify for the job. There are no federal standards for police officers. Federal lawmakers could establish such guidelines, allowing states to treat them as the bare minimum or even expand on them. States could also individually up their licensing requirements for police. For example, in Florida, barbers are required under state law to have more training than police: Barbers need to log 1, 200 hours, while cops need 770. It’s just one state, but it exemplifies how poor the standards can be for police licensing across the US. Then there are other considerations, such as whether cities and states should require a college degree for cops  —   something that isn’t required in much of the country right now.     But generally, experts say there should be strong requirements in place that can check for the skills and characteristics we expect of police before they’re put in a live situation. “We need to think seriously about paying these guys better” “We want to recruit people who have the capacity for emotional regulation  —   so they don’t get angry, they don’t see authority challenges as personal challenges, they don’t fall on use of force as the first response to a challenge to their authority,” said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist at Columbia University. “We want people who are good at planning and thinking ahead. We want people who have a capacity to reflect on their own work and update their own work  —   in other words, learn from their mistakes. ” But, Fagan added, “In order to do that, we need to think seriously about paying these guys better. ” This is the rub: Higher standards will almost certainly lead to a need to pay cops more. Otherwise, why would someone with, say, a college degree take a job as a police officer when he or she can get far more pay at a private security firm? John Roman, a criminal justice expert at the University of Chicago, agreed: “I think we should have higher standards. And if you’re going to have higher standards, you’re going to have to pay them better to attract   people. That’s just the way the free market works. ” 7) Police need to focus on the few people in communities causing chaos and violence            Along with all these changes, police can also take steps that explicitly go after crime while limiting who’s impacted by policing actions.  The vast majority of crime in communities is perpetrated by just a few people in a few specific parts of the city. As Abt, the Harvard criminologist, recently wrote for Vox, “In most cities across the nation, 3 to 5 percent of city blocks account for 50 to 75 percent of all shootings and killings, with 1 percent of a city’s population responsible for 50 to 60 percent of all homicides. ” If police focus on just these few blocks  —   through policing strategies known as “  policing” and “focused deterrence”  —   they can stop and deter a lot of crimes in their cities.  Focused deterrence in particular has been hugely successful: Study after study backs it up, and the method got much of the credit for the “Boston miracle” that saw the city’s violent crime rate drop by 79 percent in the 1990s. Rosenfeld of the University of Missouri in St. Louis explained the two prongs of focused deterrence: “We clearly know who you are, where you live, and we’re going to do everything we can to stop the violence in this community  —   and if that means that we arrest and charge you with a serious violent crime, we’re going to do that. If you want out of this life, then, secondly, here are services and support that you might find useful to set a different direction of your life. ” “In most cities across the nation, 3 to 5 percent of city blocks account for 50 to 75 percent of all shootings and killings” The social services can be costly, but they’re needed for the strategy to work. For one, they offer a way out to someone caught in a bad place in life  —   people often get trapped in violent situations due to desperate economic situations. And when cops offer these services, they also signal that they’re not just there to enforce the law, but also to try to help people out of dire circumstances. “That lends a certain legitimacy to the police,” Rosenfeld said. “They’re not there to just serve warrants or warn people about what’s going to happen to them if they commit another crime, but also conveys a certain degree of concern for those individuals and their lives. ” So these strategies can limit who’s directly impacted by policing  —   by targeting a few people in a few areas, instead of sweeping whole neighborhoods with aggressive stops. They can also signal to the community that the police get it: Most people in these communities are innocent, and police are going to focus only on those who aren’t. As Abt told me, “If you get very specific, you are better at fighting crime and reducing violence. But you also improve legitimacy by showing the community that you’re not occupying them like a military, but that you’re serving them by trying to help them address a small number of people in places that really are hurting the community. ” One big hurdle to these strategies is they can involve a big initial investment  —   and police departments, used to fighting crime in a certain way, may be resistant to new ideas, especially if they cost more money upfront. But if these strategies work to save and improve lives, there’s a moral imperative for all levels of government to take them more seriously. 8) We need better data to evaluate police and crime            If the federal government does get more involved in funding policing, it could also stand to make another change: massively improve the data we collect on crime and policing in America. As it stands, the federal government does a terrible job collecting data on crime and police actions. Nationwide crime reports tend to come out with a nearly   lag period. And virtually every expert agrees that this data very likely undercounts crime, since it misses crimes that aren’t reported to the police.  “We know virtually nothing about crime in America other than murder, kidnapping, and  arson,” Roman of the University of Chicago said. “Rape, robbery, assault, motor vehicle theft, gangs, drugs  —   we don’t report data back to the federal government that allows the federal government to tell law enforcement how to behave more efficiently or helps researchers understand how crime is created and evolves. ” “We know virtually nothing about crime in America other than murder, kidnapping, and arson” But more comprehensive, current data could be very useful for fighting crime, several experts argued. “You need that comparative information so you can determine whether that problem you’re experiencing in your own community is relatively distinctive or specific to local community conditions or it’s a common problem in many, many other communities,” Rosenfeld said. “If it’s the latter, you want to consult with those other communities to see how they’re addressing it. If it’s the former, then you know you have to devise strategies that respond to the specifics of the problems in your own community. ” It’s not just crime. Goff pointed out that there’s little to no data on what police do  —   stops, arrests, use of force, and so on. A 2015 study found that the federal agencies’ police killing data misses as many as half of all people killed by police in America. And the federal government doesn’t try to track more typical police actions, from stops to arrests. (The Justice Department is now moving on a couple of initiatives to change this, but they are still in very early stages, and it’s unclear if the Trump administration will continue these efforts.) As long as the US fails to collect this data, it’s going to be impossible to evaluate what works to address virtually any of the issues people have with police, from racial bias to crime fighting. It may cost more money to collect this data properly, but every expert I talked to brought it up as a major issue that needs to be addressed. If police get this right, they can boost faith in cops and their legitimacy in crime fighting            There’s an underlying point in all these strategies: More effective and transparent policing really can solve the two big problems  —   racial bias and high crime  —   pegged to police in America today. Whenever another police shooting of a black man hits the news, opponents of Black Lives Matter tend to fall back on a question: “But what about    crime?” The suggestion is that far more black people are murdered by black civilians, so that’s really what someone worried about black lives should worry about. What these critics miss is that distrust in the police  —   the key driver behind Black Lives Matter  —   is also a key driver of crime in minority neighborhoods. “When communities don’t trust the police and are afraid of the police, then they will not and cannot work with police and within the law around issues in their own community,” Kennedy of John Jay College said. “Then those issues within the community become issues the community needs to deal with on their own  —   and that leads to violence. ” A recent study was particularly illuminating to this end. The study, from sociologists Matthew Desmond of Harvard, Andrew Papachristos of Yale, and David Kirk of Oxford, looked at the effects of 911 calls in Milwaukee after incidents of police violence hit the news.  They found that after the 2004 police beating of Frank Jude, 17 percent (22, 200) fewer 911 calls were made in the following year compared with the number of calls that would have been made had the Jude beating never happened. More than half of the effect came from fewer calls in black neighborhoods. And the effect persisted for more than a year, even after the officers involved in the beating were punished. Researchers found similar impacts on local 911 calls after other   incidents of police violence. “When communities don’t trust the police and are afraid of the police, then they will not and cannot work with police and within the law around issues in their own community” But crime was still happening in these neighborhoods. Indeed, as 911 calls dropped, researchers also found a rise in homicides. They note that “the spring and summer that followed Jude’s story were the deadliest in the seven years observed in our study. ” That suggests that people were simply dealing with crime themselves. And although the researchers couldn’t definitively prove it, that might mean civilians took to their own  —   sometimes violent  —   means to protect themselves when they couldn’t trust police to stop crime and violence. “An important implication of this finding is that publicized cases of police violence not only threaten the legitimacy and reputation of law enforcement,” the researchers write, “they also  —   by driving down 911 calls  —   thwart the suppression of law breaking, obstruct the application of justice, and ultimately make cities as a whole, and the black community in particular, less safe. ” Better policing can’t stop all crime. There are many other issues, from jobs to housing, that also have an impact. But police, if they are trusted by the community, can have a sizable effect. To some degree, this should be common sense. Journalist Jill Leovy captured it well in her brilliant book Ghettoside: Noting that homicides are much less likely to be solved in black neighborhoods, she argues that some people in black communities have concluded that police don’t value black lives  —   and so they need to settle interpersonal conflicts on their own. Leovy writes, “Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens. ” That’s why transparency, accountability, and community cooperation, described as part of the “procedural justice” model of policing, are all so important: They signal that the justice system does care. And if the police do it right  —   by stopping overly aggressive practices and preventing crime and violence in black neighborhoods  —   they can signal that black lives really do matter to them.  Police shootings and brutality in the US: 9 things you should know   "
" It’s been almost three weeks now. The news cycle has moved on. But I, for one, have not fully processed the news that Donald J. Trump is going to be president.     Those words still sound like nonsense to me. I can’t shake the sense of surreality. And I know I’m not alone.  Before we’re entirely swept up in the Trump Outrage of the Day, I want to at least pause, take stock, and attempt to answer a simple question: What the fuck just happened? Boy was I wrong To begin, I should acknowledge just how wrong I was about this election. I never once questioned my confident prediction that Donald Trump would never become president. “Just because Trump makes no sense doesn’t mean common sense has become worthless,” I wrote after Trump won some early primaries. “One black swan does not foretell a flock of black swans. ” (Yeah. About that.)    I was overconfident, even more so than most in media. US political and media institutions were just as unprepared for this result as UK elites were for the Brexit vote  —   but at least UK elites hadn’t already witnessed the Brexit vote. Almost no one really thought it could happen here, even after we watched it happen there.             The consequences of that overconfidence are only now coming into view. Given the evidence thus far, Trump’s administration promises a reactionary lurch in policy accompanied by historic corruption and incompetence.     That’s the median probability. With Trump at the helm of foreign policy  —   temperamental and easily provoked, the only world leader who denies the threat of climate change  —   there are   risks almost too terrible to contemplate.     Like many others, I didn’t take this election as seriously as it warranted until the day it was over. I should have done better. In that spirit, I’m going to attempt here to puzzle it all out, piece by piece  —   what happened, what it meant, what there is to learn from it. Join me, if you will, on this dystopian voyage of discovery.  It was close  Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote by a sizable margin. As of this writing, she’s at 64. 9 million, to Trump’s 62. 5 million  —   a 2. 4   lead. That puts her up by a margin of 1. 8 percent. [UPDATE   :  Clinton is now at 65. 2 million, Trump at 62. 7, a 1. 9 percent margin.] There are still some outstanding votes to be counted. Ultimately, it looks like she’ll net around 65 million votes, maybe a little more. (David Wasserman, an editor at Cook Political Report, maintains an    spreadsheet of the popular vote tally if you want to follow along.)    These numbers indicate that the story of the election was not primarily about turnout, as many exit poll —  based hot takes claimed in the days after. Overall turnout is up 5 percent (so far) over 2012.  But shifts within that turnout were significant.   My latest chart on popular vote:Clinton lead 2. 2 millionRelative to 2012:GOP votes up 1. 5mDems down 1. 3m3rd party up 5. 3m pic. twitter.  —   Timothy McBride (@mcbridetd) November 27, 2016    The numbers in that tweet aren’t current any more, but they’re close. It seems the Dem vote declined slightly (a million or less) while the growth in turnout benefited Republicans and   candidates. In 2012, Obama got 65. 9 million votes and won the popular vote by a 4 percent margin. In 2016, Clinton will get about 65 million votes and win the popular vote by a 1. 9 percent margin, give or take. Clinton’s popular vote margin is smaller than those of recent Democrats, but it’s bigger than those of many past winners, bigger than Bush’s in 2000, Carter’s in 1976, Nixon’s in 1968, or Kennedy’s in 1960.  If Clinton’s 65 million votes had been properly distributed according to the ageless geographical wisdom of America’s Electoral College, she would have won.  But they were not (more on that later). Clinton lost the Electoral College, mainly due to   losses in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. As John McCormack points out, the cumulative difference in those states was 107, 330 votes. [UPDATE   : The cumulative difference is now just under 80, 000 votes.] Just under 80, 000 votes, less than the capacity of a football stadium, in a country where more than 135 million votes were cast. Roughly 0. 06 percent of the national vote. Let that marinate a while.      Clinton got the   number of votes of any presidential candidate in history. Trump, who got 2. 5 million fewer votes, won the 44th biggest Electoral College victory in history (out of 54 elections).  But he’s president. Life is funny. The country hasn’t changed overnight and there’s no “mandate” Lots of people on the left have been gripped by existential angst in the wake of the election, convinced that they fundamentally misread their country, that they don’t know America at all. In one sense, that’s legitimate. I didn’t think my country would elect a crass, xenophobic accused sexual abuser and scam artist for president either.  In another sense, though, it’s overblown. Though the transition from Obama’s America to Trump’s is vertiginous, and understandably baffling to casual (much less foreign) observers, it doesn’t reflect some huge, sudden shift in the country.  When a country is divided in half by a deep partisan split, elections are bound to be close. They can fall one way or the other with very small perturbations, as we just saw.  Democrats have more people. Though they didn’t win more votes for House candidates like they did in 2012, they did get more votes for their Senate candidates and their presidential candidate. Republicans have lost the popular vote in six out of the past seven presidential elections.    But Republicans are spread out more evenly, over a wider geographical area, dominating great swaths of    America. Here’s a   voting map, with shades of red and blue to show partisan intensity:            All those puddles of blue are cities  —   the “urban archipelago. ”  Of course, acres don’t vote, people do. Here’s the same map, weighted by population:            Turns out those cities have lots of people in them. Nonetheless, due to institutional inertia, US politics still gives geographical spread enormous weight, so despite getting fewer votes, Republicans now control every branch of government. Trump will almost certainly attempt to govern as though he has a “mandate” (one of the more meaningless notions in politics). Governing institutions and policy are sure to make a sharp turn to the right.     But America today is still the America we all knew on November 7: a nation almost evenly divided, with a slight popular vote lean toward Democrats and a somewhat heavier geographic lean toward Republicans. Demographic shifts within party coalitions sank Clinton in the Electoral College For years, the left has been foretelling a coming triumph, based on ideas best laid out in The Emerging Democratic Majority, by John Judis and Ruy Teixeira. The story is familiar by now: Older white men are dying off; the country is rapidly becoming more urban and diverse; Dems have captured the hearts of minorities, single women, and other growing demographics; sooner or later, demographics will carry Democrats to victory. In broad strokes, over some time horizon, this story is probably true. But the road to that victory is a lot longer and rougher than the left has been telling itself, and the vaunted “blue wall” is a fairy tale. In the short term, demographic shifts are actually screwing the Dems at the presidential level. As Liam Donovan explains, according to exit polls, Trump only got 1 percent more of the white vote than Romney got. But there was a big shift in which whites he got. Relative to Romney, Trump was down 10 points among whites with college degrees, but up 14 points among   whites (the   for the   white working class, or WWC).  As it happens, those new   white votes (some combination of   voters and voters switching from Obama to Trump, though we don’t yet know how many of each) are clustered right up there in the Upper Midwest, where Republicans need them.             Meanwhile, as my colleague Matt Yglesias explained, Clinton largely made up in new Asian and Latino voters what she lost in WWC and black voters (who, perhaps predictably, did not match their Obama numbers).     But the distribution is all wrong.    A little tour of recent electoral history, in maps ( ). First, the shift from  . Blue = dem improvement; red = GOP pic. twitter.  —   Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) November 29, 2016    Latino voters are clustered in Texas and California. There aren’t enough to put Texas in play (yet  —   though Clinton beat Obama’s 2012 performance by 6. 7 percent there). And California is already in the bag, so more votes there (Clinton beat Obama by 6 percent) are useless for Democrats.  Same with New Mexico (already blue) and Arizona (not close to blue, though getting closer). Asians are clustered in California, Washington, and other   states.            Clinton’s coalition seems likely to triumph in the long term. Teixeira has claimed that “because of demographic changes alone, if Democrats in 2020 garner the exact same share of every racial group that they got in 2016, they will win Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida  —   and come close in Arizona. ” But as FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten argues, if Republicans can keep increasing their vote share among whites  —   get 90 percent of white voters in the Upper Midwest like they do in the South, say  —   they can hang on to their geographical advantage for a   time. It’s a delicate dance, as two demographic ships pass in the night. Republicans will eventually need more minorities to win, but Dems needed a few more whites to win this November. One thing is clear: America’s archaic, unjust, racist Electoral College belongs on the ash heap of history.     Everyone’s got their own story about why Clinton lost Because it turned on such subtle demographic shifts and small absolute numbers, it is possible to find evidence for almost any story about Clinton’s loss. Combined with the pathos surrounding the election, this creates an ideal habitat for confirmation bias. And sure enough,   analysis is filled with people confident that this outcome (which neither they nor anyone else predicted) proves they were right all along. Here are just a few of the stories one might tell:  It’s simple: Clinton was a bad candidate with historically high unfavorables. Sanders woulda won. Or maybe Biden. Or O’Malley.  Clinton did nothing to court those lost WWC voters. She should have put more resources into swing states. Her campaign was arrogant and overconfident. It focused all its attention on registration instead of persuading    voters, who ended up breaking Trump.  Clinton should have run on a positive economic program rather than on Trump’s character.  Clinton ended up running against the Sanders left, the FBI, Russian hackers, WikiLeaks, and a campaign press that channeled   bullshit artists and their fake scandals. That’s all in addition to her opponent, whose rallies featured chants of, “Lock her up!” Despite all that, she won a resounding victory in the popular vote and outperformed what   models predicted. She didn’t do so bad.              Rural whites feel left behind economically and disdained socially. They hate what they see as a hostile     elite and in the end were willing to vote for just about anyone who promised to punch those elites in the nose. The voters who swung to Trump were distinguished not by income, but by education.   voters proved more amenable to Trump’s crude behavior and xenophobia, just as they have swung to   parties in Europe.  The WWC is getting all the blame, but the white,   middle and upper class  —   the actual elite, who have no “economic anxiety” excuses  —   are responsible for Trump’s win. They should answer for it. Misogyny. It was excused in Trump and directed at Clinton from all parts of the political spectrum, very much including the left, and very much including women. If   married Republican women had found misogyny disqualifying, Clinton would have won. (Read Rebecca Traister and Katha Pollitt on what a crushing blow the results represent for women. This Vogue profile of Michelle Obama  —   the most decent human being in American public life, someone who’s done much to inspire young women with her example  —   is the one thing I’ve been physically unable to finish.) Voter suppression worked.    candidates, who received a larger number of votes than the margin of victory in several swing states, threw the election. James Comey’s   intervention  —   building on the work of Russian hackers, their WikiLeaks enablers, and an American press devoted to hyping the bullshit email scandal beyond all reason  —   threw the election. (  and    voters overwhelmingly went Trump.)               The press puffed up Trump from the very beginning, showering him with free media and credulous coverage, and carried him to victory.  The beleaguered American WWC is tired of neoliberalism and ready for socialism, except it’s not really socialism  —   it’s democratic socialism, like Denmark, although Denmark doesn’t want to be called that. The WWC gets all this. If Clinton had embraced Sanders’s plan for free (not just subsidized) college, a $15 (not just $12) minimum wage, and a carbon tax (not just carbon regulations) the WWC would have stuck with her. Racism! But more on that in a minute.  Like everyone, I buy some of these more than others. But there are bits and pieces of evidence for all of them. Some of them don’t hold up on their own  —   voter suppression probably didn’t swing the election, nor did   candidates  —   but all of them plausibly played a role or have some grain of truth. Given the difficulty of picking apart causal threads around complex sociopolitical events, our inability to run counterfactuals, imperfect hindsight, and the strong temptation to motivated reasoning on all sides, the truth is that we’ll never know exactly which factors made the difference, or which narrative is “correct. ” The best we can probably do is echo Alex Pareene: Fuck everything and blame everyone. Turns out everything mattered  The most agonizing implication of the narrow loss is that everything mattered.     Every decision to hype Clinton’s emails. Comey’s extraordinary violation of precedent. WikiLeaks. Clinton’s Goldman Sachs speeches. Her refusal to dissociate from the Clinton Foundation. Her poor retail politics. Trump not releasing his tax returns. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan hiding out. Sanders tarnishing Clinton’s image among young people. Institutions standing by and doing nothing as Trump shredded democratic norms. The gamble that Trump’s misogyny and racism would render him unacceptable. Fake news on Facebook. Epistemological bubbles. Elite  . Hot take after hot take delivered to the choir. Americans making the contest into a crass reality TV show fueled by Facebook memes. The press refusing to cover policy. And whatever else you can name. The Electoral College turned on an   margin. All of it mattered. If you’re prone to haunting, crippling regret (luckily I don’t know anyone like that) that’s where you should focus your energy.             This is roughly what the models predicted, which is either exactly what you’d expect or completely crazy  As political scientist John Sides notes, the outcome of the election was, after all the Sturm und Drang, roughly what the   models predicted. Those models are based on the   “fundamentals”  —   things like the rate of economic growth, the president’s approval rating, and the generally grim prospects of a party that’s been in office for two terms (“desire for change”). It was based on models like these that Vox built its “Trump tax calculator,” which purported to show how far Trump was trailing what would be expected of a generic Republican.  In the end, though, there was virtually no “vote splitting. ” About 90 percent of   Republicans voted for Trump (89 percent of Dems voted for Clinton). He did roughly as well as a generic Republican. The GOP came home.    What should we make of this?  Trump is obviously not a generic anything. He said or did things almost every day on the campaign trail that would have disqualified any previous presidential candidate. (See James Fallows’s invaluable Trump Time Capsule series.) He had no real campaign beyond rallies, bought very few ads, did no fancy polling or data analysis, had no ground game to speak of, and ran a campaign staff of feuding amateurs.  By all rights, he shouldn’t have been a generic Republican candidate; he should have been a very bad one. And lots of people still believe he was; they think other Democrats could have won the race.  That’s one way of looking at it. Another is that the American chattering classes have once again underestimated the sheer tidal force of polarization  —   or more accurately, “negative partisanship,” a loathing of the other side  —   in American life.              Many people assumed that certain norms and standards still transcend the partisan divide. Surely being accused of, and admitting on tape to, serial sexual assault. Surely swindling poor people with a fake university. Surely crude racial stereotypes. Surely running a charitable foundation as a slush fund. Surely encouraging violence at rallies or threatening to reject unwelcome election results. Surely celebrating torture or vowing war crimes. Clinton bet most of her chips on there being some floor, some violation of norms too low even for today’s radicalized Republican Party. She thought responsible Republican officeholders would rally. She thought at least     Republican women would recoil in horror.  She was wrong. There is no floor. Partisanship has been revealed as the strongest force in US public life  —   stronger than any norms, independent of any facts.     Ezra Klein sums it up:  Political scientist Julia Azari has written the single most important sentence for understanding both Trump’s rise and this dangerous era in American politics: “The defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong. ” Here is the problem, in short: Parties, and particularly the Republican Party, can no longer control whom they nominate. But once they nominate someone  —   once they nominate anyone  —   that person is guaranteed the support of both the party’s elites and its voters.               Economic populism’s power over the white working class is more often assumed than demonstrated Lots of people, particularly white male pundits, have reacted to this unprecedented and bizarre election by reaching for familiar story lines. One of the most popular, and most familiar, is the    narrative. You’ve heard it before: The Democratic Party has been captured by decadent coastal elites and Wall Street, muting its economic populism. Instead, it spends its time appealing to urban special interest groups with “identity politics,” such politically correct fripperies as multigender bathrooms and microaggressions.  Meanwhile, it has lost touch with     Real Americans in the working class, the ones that make our eyes mist up when we watch those Chevy commercials. Because Democrats are offering those     folk nothing, they are turning to Republicans, who are at least acknowledging their problems and offering them easy scapegoats.  This narrative has been common on the right, and among centrist pundits, for ages. It dominated the ’90s and persisted well into the 2000s. It was the main argument Democrats had after John Kerry lost in 2004. Oddly, this cycle it has gripped the left as well.   I come from the white working class, and I am deeply humiliated that the Democratic Party cannot talk to the people where I came from. —   Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 14, 2016    Sanders, like many of the people rehashing this narrative, means well. They want Dems to offer the WWC better economic policies. They believe that doing so will bring at least some of the WWC back into the fold. And they may be right.    But we’ve seen this dynamic play out before. (Remember when Howard Dean said, “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks”?) Whenever Washington pundits and politicians start talking about Dems appealing to the WWC, the result is demonizing minorities (see: Sister Souljah) passing punitive    policies (see: 1994 crime bill) supporting fossil fuels (see: Joe Manchin literally shooting cap and trade) and making a big show of, say, hunting (see: John Kerry, 2004).  It has never, in my memory, led to more social democratic welfare policies.    1. Ppl. worry the concern with   whites will lead to PoC being marginalized for good reason: it’s happened so many times before. https:  .  —   James Surowiecki (@JamesSurowiecki) November 13, 2016    There isn’t a ton of evidence that an economically populist message  —   divorced of appeals to xenophobia or white resentment  —   moves the WWC. In fact, as Andrew Prokop notes, “In two of those crucial Midwestern states that flipped to Trump, Democratic Senate candidates [Russ Feingold and Ted Strickland] campaigned on economically populist platforms  —   but they did notably worse than Hillary Clinton. ”  Why is that?  Perhaps because politicians know, though won’t say, that appeals to xenophobia and white resentment work. If I may coin a phrase: It’s the white resentment, stupid.  On that subject, I recommend this piece from Zack Beauchamp and this tweetstorm from T. R. Ramachandran:   1) These Sanders tweets on WWC are what happens when good intentions meet high school term papers that get a D  —   let me tweetsplain why pic. twitter.  —   T. R. Ramachandran (@yottapoint) November 15, 2016    The mythic image of the “working class” is out of date Many narratives about the “working class” that still dominate American life are premised on the unspoken presumption that the working class is white  —   specifically, a manly white man, working in manufacturing or manual labor, living in a small town and driving a pickup truck.     This cultural paradigm is what fuels the notion that Dems are distracted by “identity politics,” which is what white male pundits call the particular interests of groups that aren’t the WWC. (From the left, see Mark Lilla. From the right, see Marc Thiessen and Ed Rogers. From Mansplainia, see Bill Maher.) But it writes huge swaths of the working class out of the picture.  Members of today’s working class are just as likely to be urban minorities in service jobs  —   who vote Democrat, despite being, by most objective measures, worse off than the WWC.  So Trump did not appeal to “the working class. ” Even among the white working class, he only really dominated in the South. His appeal was to   whites, not to any particular economic class.  If you acknowledge urban minorities as part of the working class, you have to acknowledge that they face unique barriers to prosperity. Being harassed and shot by police is not some boutique issue  —   it’s a huge drag on workforce participation among minorities. For a transgender employee, being able to use the restroom in peace is very much an economic issue. For a Latino immigrant, the threat of deportation is an economic issue. For gay and lesbian voters, the ability to marry and have children is an economic issue. These are economic issues facing the working class. They are about giving every American full and equal participation in American cultural and economic life. (Read Jamelle Bouie on this.)             Calls for the Democrats to turn away from identity politics amount to demands that the interests of rural white voters be recentered and that the interests and votes of other demographics be viewed as vaguely suspect.   white man and wife has become a powerful identity  As Matt Yglesias keeps writing, all politics is identity politics.  As other groups have risen in visibility and influence in America,   white men have become more aware of themselves as a tribe. (Fun fact: White people in the US used to identify as Poles, Germans, Russians, etc. not “white people. ”) They’ve begun to feel “group threat. ”  The more the country urbanizes and the white share of the vote shrinks, the more   white becomes a distinct identity. And all evidence points to the fact that voters do not make decisions based on “issues” or ideology, but on identity. We are tribal creatures. Trump’s campaign was pure identity politics  —   white   male identity politics. As Michelle Goldberg wrote in a righteous piece on this subject, “We should pay Trump voters the courtesy of assuming that at least some of them knew what they were doing when they opted for the politics of cultural revenge delivered by a billionaire in a   airplane. ”             Clinton ran on policies that would help the working class Of course Clinton spoke to the economic insecurities of   whites. She ran on the most progressive economic platform in a  .  She wanted to raise the minimum wage, offer paid family and medical leave, create universal   and subsidized day care, expand Social Security, accelerate state Medicaid expansion, offer   college, and create an infrastructure bank, all paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy. All those things would help   Americans, including the white ones. She even had a $30 billion plan specifically targeted at   Appalachian communities.  Voters never heard about it. Here, according to Gallup, is what voters heard about the candidates:            Almost all the information that reached voters about Clinton was about scandal  —   emails, the foundation, pneumonia, etc. The three big nightly network newscasts spent three times as many minutes on Clinton’s emails as they did on all policy issues combined.  It’s pretty silly to say that the WWC chose Trump over Clinton on policy grounds when they never heard a thing about her policies (and very little about his). The source of his appeal lay elsewhere. Hmm . .. Trump voters were distinguished by their white resentment Why be coy or euphemistic about this? Study after study after study came to the same conclusion: What most distinguished Trump voters was not their economic status but their attitudes on race, gender, and immigration. Trump ran on white male resentment and won because white male resentment appeals to a lot of white people, including a lot of white women.  Some have asked how racial resentment could be to blame when many Trump voters are former Obama voters. But that mistakes how race works. Precisely because he was black, Obama could run a mostly nonracial campaign. When he did remind voters he was black, as in the Trayvon Martin eulogy, he came in for relentless criticism on the right. It’s called “priming”  —   when you remind white people that they are white people, by drawing attention to other groups, their racial consciousness rises. They become more sensitive to     dynamics. Clinton’s problem is that she couldn’t rely on her identity to tell the story of intersectionality, so she had to tell it out loud, paying rhetorical fealty to all the subaltern groups the Democratic Party represents. And Trump reminded his   white voters again and again that he was with them, against all the threats  —   indifferent elites, murderous illegal immigrants, pollution regulations, violent urban gangs, terrorists  —   they faced from outside. The   race was an extended exercise in priming.             Another episode of Racism Without Racists Predictably, after the nation’s white people elected a man who campaigned on   appeals and promised   policies, the top priority of many white pundits was to defend their honor.   There is nothing more maddening    and counterproductive    to me than saying that Trump’s 59 million votes were all racist. Ridiculous. —   Chris Cillizza (@TheFix) November 10, 2016    Not the election of a xenophobic  . Not the surge of   hate crimes after the election. Not the appointment of Steve Bannon, who has spent years mainstreaming white nationalism, to a key position in the next administration. Nothing is more maddening than having the innocence of white Americans besmirched. There have been dozens of #NotAllTrumpSupporters tweets and posts and videos flying around since the election, urging us not to make the terrible mistake of holding Trump voters responsible for damage he will do to vulnerable lives. He might be a racist, they say, but his voters aren’t. This is how discussions of racism in America get derailed. You start by conceiving of “racist” as a binary category, something one is or isn’t. Then you define racism as explicit belief that one race is superior to another. Only a small fringe has those   racist beliefs, so, voila, there are hardly any racists! (You can play the same game with “sexist. ”) Meanwhile, studies show that “implicit bias”  —   subconscious negative stereotypes about particular races and genders  —   is ubiquitous, even among people who would never consciously espouse discrimination. And statistics show that outcomes are systematically biased against women and minorities, whether it’s housing, income, or the criminal justice system.  So racist and sexist biases are rampant in America. Racist and sexist outcomes are rampant in America. But apparently there are very few racists or sexists in America. We just perpetuate systemic racism and sexism by accident. Oops.  Women and minorities in America will find this a familiar story. Somehow, vouchsafing the innocence of white people takes precedence over holding them responsible or protecting those who will suffer as a result of their choices. Systemic discrimination becomes a crime with no criminals. (Tressie McMillan Cottom has a good piece on this.) Put it this way: If you can elect an authoritarian who ran on racial resentment and have the nation’s elites respond with gushing displays of empathy . .. you may be white. Yes, more empathy, please  —   in all directions Much was made in this election, and is still being made, about how out of touch media and political elites are with the kind of people who voted for Trump. Elites cluster in cities, tapping on their laptops and sipping their lattes, while out in the hinterlands, people are suffering. There is truth to this. The two biggest dividing lines between Clinton and Trump voters were urban versus rural and   versus not. Virtually everyone in political media or national politics is on the former side of both those divides.  However, many people in (still overwhelmingly white) political and media circles come from Trump country. They have family and friends there, people who watch Fox News and voted for Trump. Those connections are a source of both anguish and fascination. How can people they know to be good believe such terrible things? Yes, this familiarity can often breed disdain (and unproductive Facebook battles). City folks have been looking down on the country folks they left behind, or at least have been suspected of doing so, for as long as there have been cities. But it also generates empathy, which has resulted in some truly spectacular journalism on rural and   whites. There’s Arlie Russell Hochschild’s book, of course, and J. D. Vance’s. I love reading Chris Arnade (see here and here) and David Wong (here and here). I even took a turn myself.  At this point, the genre of “talking to Trump voters to find out why they’re so angry” has become so common the Awl spoofed it.             What I haven’t seen are nearly as many tender profiles of   black families in cities. I didn’t read as much about   Latinos struggling to pay for college. There weren’t a ton of thumbsuckers on single mothers in the Atlanta suburbs, Muslim families in Dearborn, Michigan, or seasonal farm workers in California. (This stellar New York Times piece on Latina hotel workers was a welcome exception.) America is full of different kinds of people, many of whom are suffering, all of whom face difficult challenges. They all deserve empathy. They all deserve a living wage and decent public services and fair treatment under the law. They all deserve every consideration as Real Americans.  The problem is that US politics and media tend to draw from a very narrow strip of that American tapestry  —   still disproportionately white, male, educated at Ivy League schools, cosmopolitan in outlook, and (if it’s not redundant to add) privileged as shit. The   “bubble” is real.  This leads to a lack of empathy in all directions. But the direction that should alarm us most is downward, the lack of empathy for many of the lowest and most vulnerable.  What American mainstream pundits often cannot see is that the latitude they extend white voters  —   “they know not what they do, they’re good people at heart, they’re just hurting”  —   is the essence of white privilege.  Such latitude is not offered to other groups. Black people protesting police violence are offered no forgiveness from pundits because they’re “just hurting. ” The occasional violence or extremism at those protests is never waved away as an accidental byproduct of good intentions. The US media did not parse the words of Black Lives Matter, seeking the most charitable interpretation. But they’ll do a fawning profile of angry white racists if they so much as put on a suit.  Yes, America’s elites, especially in journalism, could badly use more empathy. That doesn’t mean hiring a token conservative columnist. It doesn’t mean more profiles of the folks back home. It means more diversity across the board  —   education, class, race, religion, gender, and sexuality.  This is a disaster that is energizing the worst of America The most terrifyingly prescient piece I read this year was Amanda Taub on the rise of American authoritarianism.          Whatever the disputes among factions on the left, whatever the intentions of Trump voters, the fact is that an unprepared, wildly corrupt authoritarian is headed for the White House, drawing his support from   voters. Along the way, Trump has managed to revive or energize almost every sour   and      in American life. Newt Gingrich. Rudy Giuliani. Chris Christie. Ted Nugent. Michael Flynn. Sarah Palin. Myron f’ing Ebell. He’s empowered the worst sort of racists and loons, like Steve Bannon and Alex Jones. He’s gathered up the worst of the media, Hannity and Limbaugh and the Breitbart crew. Now he’s sifting through the Republican Party establishment roster looking for diamonds in the rough like Jeff Sessions. In retrospect, the 2016 election has rendered every venal,   move by Republicans under Obama  —   from obstructionism during the economic recovery to government shutdowns to refusing to confirm Merrick Garland  —   politically astute. It turns out Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan played it exactly right by hiding in a bunker while Trump insulted Gold Star families.              Trump’s bullying misogyny, his mendacity, his contempt for the free press, his disregard for policy or preparation  —   all of it, we are now forced to admit, was brilliant. He won on it, when everyone said he couldn’t. And so every ugly impulse, every broken norm, every fetid alliance has now been ratified, affirmed as good politics. Other politicians will learn these lessons. The press will set about normalizing them. The damage Trump has already done to the American democratic process is not inconsiderable, but it is only the beginning. Every unpleasant American political memory is about to return to haunt us, unleashed under an unstable   president and a Congress controlled by Republicans who make George W. Bush’s GOP look like Obama Democrats. What we can learn from this mess At long last, let’s return to the original question: What did I learn from being so damn wrong? My basic political Weltanschauung has not changed. I still think the American ideal of multiethnic social democracy is worth pursuing, and worth defending from illiberalism in all its guises.  I still think the primary problem in American politics today is the intersection of three trends: 1) Rural and suburban white men resent recent economic and demographic changes; 2) their rebellion against those changes, combined with political institutions distorted to favor rural and suburban voters, has created a dangerously radical major party mixing xenophobic authoritarianism and libertarianism; and 3) trust in American institutions, from media to political parties to academia, has declined for decades and is now in the dirt.  There are no longer mediating institutions capable of slowing our headlong descent into epistemological relativism and partisan nihilism. Or so it seems. I’d say the election has changed three things for me (though I’m still processing it, like everyone else, and its meaning will only become clear with some distance).  First, it seems I’ll need to develop a much deeper appreciation of historical contingency, the vulnerability of institutions, and, for lack of a better word, tragedy. Shit, as they say, happens. The arc of the moral universe is long indeed. It bends toward justice, then it bends back. This feels like a black swan event to me, an unlikely concatenation of circumstances that offers a last gasp to forces in American life that are inexorably fading.  But that feeling? That gut sense that “it’s going to be okay”? I no longer trust that feeling. At all.              It’s possible that white nationalism is an ineradicable element of American life. It’s possible American institutions have failed so thoroughly that some sort of illiberal strongman is inevitable. It’s possible that further Republican gains could give them control of enough states to start passing constitutional amendments returning the US to the 19th century. It’s possible that a terrorist attack under the coming administration could cause panic and backlash that leads to a police state. It’s possible something as bad as or worse than internment camps will come along, or widespread racial violence.  I don’t expect that stuff to happen, and I’m certainly not predicting it, but you can damn well believe I will never again take those possibilities lightly. There are no guarantees America will be okay. Second, it’s clear Democrats need to focus on doing identity politics right, rather than waiting for demographics to do the work for them. That means developing identities that cut across demographic barriers, sensitive to difference but rooted in inclusive values and   economic prosperity. (Again, read Bouie.) The way to do that is not primarily with “messaging” but with institution building, from the ground up. Democrats have to get into communities across the country, in every state, and organize people around a common vision, not just once every four years but continually, the kind of work unions and churches used to do (and still do, though not in the places or at the scale necessary).  Third, when it comes to writing about politics, I’m going to make an effort to do less prognosticating and more   analysis. What matters is what politicians do and how it affects people. Covering politics like a theater critic, speculating whether this or that move will play well with this or that group, has never seemed more inadequate. Core American democratic values are being called into question. The political press is better off elucidating and defending those values than speculating about whether trashing them yields a bump in the polls.  What the fuck just happened? Things got very, very real. It’s time for everyone to do better. "
"        In the future, Americans  —   assuming there are any left  —   will look back at 2016 and remark: “What the HELL?” They will have a point. Over the past few decades, we here at the Year in Review have reviewed some pretty disturbing years. For example, there was 2000, when the outcome of a presidential election was decided by a tiny group of deeply confused Florida residents who had apparently attempted to vote by chewing on their ballots. Then there was 2003, when a person named “Paris Hilton” suddenly became a major international superstar, despite possessing a level of discernible talent so low as to make the Kardashians look like the Jackson 5. There was 2006, when the vice president of the United States  —   who claimed he was attempting to bring down a suspected quail  —   shot a    man in the face, only to be exonerated after an investigation revealed that the victim was an attorney. And  —   perhaps most inexplicable of all  —   there was 2007, when millions of people voluntarily installed Windows Vista. Yes, we’ve seen some weird years. But we’ve never seen one as weird as 2016. This was the Al Yankovic of years. If years were movies, 2016 would be “Plan 9 From Outer Space. ” If years were relatives, 2016 would be the uncle who shows up at your Thanksgiving dinner wearing his underpants on the outside.      (Claritza Jimenez, Elahe   Washington Post)   Why do we say this? Let’s begin with the gruesome train wreck that was the presidential election. The campaign began with roughly 14, 000 candidates running. Obviously not all of them were qualified to be president; some of them  —   here we are thinking of “Lincoln Chafee”  —   were probably imaginary. But a reasonable number of the candidates seemed to meet at least the minimum standard that Americans have come to expect of their president in recent decades, namely: Not Completely Horrible. So this mass of candidates began the grim death march that is the modern American presidential campaign  —   trudging around Iowa pretending to care about agriculture, performing in an endless series of televised debates like   seals trained to bark out talking points, going to barbecue after barbecue and smiling relentlessly through mouthfuls of dripping meat, giving the same speech over and over and over, shaking millions of hands, posing for billions of selfies and just generally humiliating themselves in the marathon group grovel that America insists on putting its presidential candidates through. And we voters did our part, passing judgment on the candidates, thinning the herd, rejecting them one by one. Sometimes we had to reject them more than once; John Kasich didn’t get the message until his own staff felled him with tranquilizer darts.  But eventually we eliminated the contenders whom we considered to be unqualified or disagreeable, whittling our choices down until only two major candidates were left. And out of all the possibilities, the two that We, the People, in our collective wisdom, deemed worthy of competing for the most important job on Earth, turned out to be . .. . .. drum roll . .. . .. the most flawed, sketchy and generally disliked duo of presidential candidates ever! Yes. After all that, the American people, looking for a leader, ended up with a choice between ointment and suppository. The fall campaign was an unending national nightmare, broadcast relentlessly on cable TV. CNN told us over and over that Donald Trump was a colossally ignorant, narcissistic,      buffoon; Fox News countered that Hillary Clinton was a greedy, corrupt, coldly calculating liar of massive ambition and minimal accomplishment. In our hearts we knew the awful truth: They were both right. It wasn’t just bad. It was the Worst. Election. Ever. And that was only one of the reasons 2016 should never have happened. Here are some others: ● American race relations reached their lowest point since . .. okay, since 2015. ● We learned that the Russians are more involved in our election process than the League of Women Voters. ●Much of the year the economy continued to struggle, with the only growth sector being people paying insane prices for tickets to “Hamilton. ” ● In a fad even stupider than “planking,” millions of people wasted millions of hours, and sometimes risked their lives, trying to capture imaginary Pokémon Go things on their phones, hoping to obtain the ultimate prize: a whole bunch of imaginary Pokémon Go things on their phones. ● A major new threat to American communities  —   receiving at least as much coverage as global climate change  —   emerged in the form of: clowns. ● In a shocking development that caused us to question our most fundamental values, Angelina and Brad broke up even though they are both physically attractive. ● We continued to prove, as a nation, that no matter how many times we are reminded, we are too stupid to remember to hold our phones horizontally when we make videos. ● Musically, we lost Prince, David Bowie and Leonard Cohen; we gained the   TV commercial in which Jon Bon Jovi screeches about turning back time. Did anything good happen in 2016? Let us think. . .. Okay, the “man bun” appeared to be going away. That was pretty much it for the good things. And now, finally, it is time for 2016 to go away. But before it does, let’s narrow our eyes down to slits and take one last squinting look back at this hideous monstrosity of a year, starting with . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)  January . .. which actually begins on a positive note with the capture of elusive Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, who in 2015 escaped (for the second time) from a Mexican prison when authorities failed to notice the signs reading (in Spanish) “WARNING: ESCAPE TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ” Since then Guzmán had been in hiding except for an interview with Sean Penn, a guest spot with Jimmy Kimmel and a series of commercials for Buffalo Wild Wings.  Mexican police finally are able to track him down during his   stint as a guest judge on “America’s Got Talent. ” He is taken to Tijuana and incarcerated in what authorities describe as “a very secure Motel 6. ” In health news, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responding to the spread of the   Zika virus, cautions Americans not to have unprotected sex with foreign mosquitoes. Meanwhile the Flint, Mich. water crisis worsens when samples taken from the city’s main water supply are found to contain traces of a Chipotle burrito.  North Korea successfully tests a hydrogen bomb, although this achievement is tarnished somewhat by the fact that the explosion causes the death, by startling, of the isolated nation’s lone remaining chicken. In what critics cite as yet another example of declining U. S. prestige, Iran seizes two U. S. naval vessels and captures 10 crew members; what makes the incident particularly embarrassing is that these vessels were docked in Cleveland. The captured sailors are released, but only after Secretary of State John Kerry assures the Iranian government that he will not deploy James Taylor. The Powerball jackpot reaches a record $1. 6 billion, with an estimated 45 percent of the tickets being purchased by the city of Detroit using money budgeted for “infrastructure. ” Speaking of huge amounts of money being wasted, in . ..

On the Republican side, the big issue  —   as you would expect, given the stakes in this election  —   is Donald Trump’s hand size and whether it does or does not correlate with the size of his portfolio, which he claims is huge, although he is reluctant to show it to the   public.  The   issue is raised by Marco Rubio, who scores in the early polls, then fades as voters realize that he is still in the early stages of puberty. Trump’s strongest rival is Ted Cruz, a veteran debater so knowledgeable and confident that Mahatma Gandhi would want to punch him in the face.  Meanwhile Jeb Bush, who was considered the early favorite, fails to gain traction with the voters despite having by far the most comprehensive set of policy initiativezzz Sorry! We nodded off thinking about Jeb, as did the voters. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is widely presumed to be the   based on being a historic woman with a lengthy résumé of service to the nation who, with her husband, Bill, has serviced the nation for decades to the tune of several hundred million dollars. She is declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses via a controversial and confusing process that, in some precincts, involves dodgeball. But Clinton faces an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders, a feisty    senator from Vermont with a message of socialism, but the good kind of socialism where everybody gets a lot of free stuff, not the kind where starving people fight over who gets the lone remaining beet at the  . Sanders wins the New Hampshire Democratic primary, followed  —   in what some observers see as a troubling sign  —   by Vladimir Putin. In other February news: ● A lengthy standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon finally comes to an end when   militants, after protracted negotiations, are eaten by the federal wildlife. ● Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the nation’s political leaders observe a period of mourning and reflection lasting 3 billionths of a second, then commence the important bipartisan work of not making any progress whatsoever on a replacement. ● The troubled Chipotle chain temporarily closes all of its restaurants after several customers are attacked by what health authorities describe as “E. coli bacteria the size of adult pythons. ” ● The Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl, thanks in part to a costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty called on the Carolina Panthers defense for stealing Peyton Manning’s walker. Speaking of unsportsmanlike, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   March . .. the Republican presidential race grows increasingly nasty, spiraling downward in tone to the point where Ted Cruz makes the following statement, which we swear we are not making up: “Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him. ” This sounds as though Cruz is saying that he would copulate with a rat, as long as the rat was not Donald Trump.  Presumably that is not what Cruz meant, but nobody really wants to know what he did mean. Meanwhile Ben Carson announces, in his extremely   and   manner, that he is going to suspend his campaign. Or visit Spain. Or possibly rob a train. There is no way to be certain. On the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders are also in a tight and testy battle, although Clinton slowly gains the upper hand thanks to the Democratic Party’s controversial formula for allocating “superdelegates,” which is as follows: ● 57 percent go to Clinton. ● The remaining 43 percent also go to Clinton. Responding to charges from the Sanders camp that the Democratic National Committee is tipping the scales in Clinton’s favor, chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz states that “the DNC is scrupulously neutral in the contest between Secretary Clinton and the senile Commie fart. ” In other political news, President Obama nominates Merrick Garland to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Republican leaders are quick to note that, while Garland appears to be qualified, his name is an anagram for “Rancid Lark Germ. ” But by far the most controversial political issue of the month  —   which nobody thought about before, yet which all of a sudden is the defining civil rights struggle of the 21st century  —   is the question of who can pee where in North Carolina. In foreign affairs, Obama pays a historic visit to Cuba but is forced to leave after three days when he discovers that there is only one golf course.  A historic baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team has to be called off in the fourth inning because all but four of the Cuban players have switched sides. Speaking of historic, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark   The Washington Post)   April . .. England observes the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrates the occasion by wearing a large hat and smiling grimly at horses.  Meanwhile world tension mounts when satellite imagery reveals that North Korea has positioned an    plastic bottle containing an estimated 40 million liters of Diet Coke on the border with South Korea, and has somehow obtained what one military analyst describes as “Mentos mints the size of barns. ”  North Korea insists that the project is “strictly defensive,” but the United Nations Security Council, responding with its toughest sanctions yet against the rogue nation, votes to unfriend Kim Jong Un on Facebook. In another alarming international development, Russian fighter jets, continuing a pattern of increasingly provocative behavior toward the United States, attack the control tower at LaGuardia Airport. After assessing the damage, airport authorities announce that departing flights will be delayed an average of four months, nearly twice as long as usual. Secretary of State Kerry calls the act “a deliberate provocation” and, in his strongest response to date, warns that the United States is considering “a harshly worded memorandum. ” In U. S. presidential politics, Ted Cruz, making a   effort to stop the Trump juggernaut, announces that his choice for running mate is  —   prepare for a   jolt of   excitement  —   Carly Fiorina. This would be the same Carly Fiorina who dropped out after the New Hampshire primary because she got approximately six votes. On the plus side, Cruz manages to make this announcement without mentioning rats. In other political news, Hillary Clinton is troubled by a persistent cough that leaves her unable to speak at some campaign stops, forcing her to express her commitment to working families by shattering a porcelain figurine of a Wall Street banker with a hammer.  A Trump spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity, says that the Trump campaign “will not speculate on Mrs. Clinton’s health,” adding that “she obviously has some terrible disease. ” Speaking of bad news, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   May . .. tragedy strikes the Cincinnati Zoo when zoo authorities, fearing for the life of a    who climbed into the gorilla enclosure, are forced to shoot and kill a gorilla named Harambe, who instantly becomes way more revered on the Internet than Mother Teresa. In other domestic news, passengers at major U. S. airports complain that they are missing flights because security lines are so long. Q. How long are they? A. One of them contains a Wright brother. Asked for an explanation, a spokesperson for the federal Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for screening passengers, blames the airline industry, pointing out that “If the airlines didn’t keep selling tickets, we wouldn’t have all these people showing up at airports trying to catch flights. ” The spokesperson suggests that people planning to travel by air during busy times should consider other options, such as suicide. In a medical breakthrough, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital announce that they have performed the first successful penis transplant in the United States. The patient’s name  —   we are not making this item up  —   is Manning. Abroad, satellite surveillance reveals that North Korea has constructed what military analysts describe as “an extremely large slingshot” as well as a latex balloon believed large enough to hold a quantity of water equivalent to Lake Tahoe. The North Korean government insists that these items are intended for “medical research. ” In sports, suspicions of doping by Russian Olympic athletes resurface after   sprinter Vladimir Raspatovsky, who has never previously posted a world  record time, wins the Kentucky Derby. Speaking of winners, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   June . .. it becomes evident that, barring some highly unlikely political development, the next president of the United States will be either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Meanwhile, the nation is in the grip of a worsening heroin epidemic. Coincidence? You be the judge. Speaking of coincidences: Bill Clinton happens to find himself in the same airport as U. S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and  —   as any two people would do if one of them was the nation’s chief law enforcement officer and the other was married to the subject of a federal investigation  —   they meet privately aboard Lynch’s Justice Department jet. When word of the meeting leaks out, Lynch assures the press that she and Bill did not discuss the FBI investigation into Hillary’s email, adding, “nor did we inhale. ” For her part, Hillary continues to insist that she never emailed anything classified, and even if she did she actually didn’t, besides which so did a lot of other people such as Colin Powell and Harry Truman, and this   scandal is ancient history from literally years ago that just makes a person sigh and roll her eyes because it is preventing her from fighting for working families while at the same time being a historic woman. Also for the sake of balance we should note that throughout June Donald Trump continues to emit a steady stream of truly idiotic statements. In sports, Cleveland  —   in a historic upset  —   actually wins something. But the big sports story for June, and the year, is the death of Muhammad Ali, a person so remarkable that even the tidal wave of phony, saccharine     that engulfs modern celebrity deaths cannot detract from the simple truth that he really was as great as he said he was. Internationally, the top story is “Brexit”  —   the decision by voters in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. This comes as a big surprise to professional pollsters, who had confidently predicted the opposite result; they enjoy a hearty laugh, then head across the Atlantic to apply their talents to the forthcoming American presidential election. Meanwhile British politics is plunged into chaos, the result being that in . ..       (Illustration by Mark   The Washington Post)   July . .. Prime Minister David Cameron and other top officials resign, new people take office, and the United Kingdom essentially has a new government, ready to move on. This entire process takes about two weeks, or less time than it takes the major American political parties to agree on the seating arrangements for a “town hall debate. ” In U. S. politics, the Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Trump, although many top party officials are unable to attend because of an urgent, compelling need to not be there. Nevertheless Trump receives enthusiastic   endorsements from former celebrity Scott Baio, several dozen Trump children and current Trump wife Melania, who enthralls delegates with a   speech in which she tells her heartwarming story of growing up as an African American woman in Chicago. The dramatic highlight comes on the final night, when Trump, in his acceptance speech, brings the delegates cheering to their feet with his emotional challenge to “grab the future by the    . ” On the Democratic side, the month gets off to a rocky start when FBI Director James Comey, announcing the results of the bureau’s investigation, reveals that when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her official emails, some including classified material, were basically as secure from prying eyes as a neon beer sign. Nevertheless Comey says he is recommending that no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, because, quote, “I don’t want to die. ” With that legal hurdle cleared, relieved Democrats gather in Philadelphia for their convention, which opens  —   in a bid to placate Sanders delegates  —   with the ceremonial caning of Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This is followed by several hundred speeches praising Hillary Clinton for the many accomplishments she has achieved, as well as the achievements she has accomplished, while at the same time being, historically, a woman. In her acceptance speech, Clinton calls on Americans “to join with me in building a better world for us and for our children,” adding, “or I will crush you like an insect. ” In a media   Roger Ailes resigns as chairman of Fox News following allegations that his name can be re arranged to spell “I ogle rears. ” As the month ends, skydiver Luke Aikins sets a world record by jumping out of a plane 25, 000 feet over California without a parachute or wingsuit. He manages to land safely in a net despite the fact that on the way down  —   in what John Kerry calls “a deliberate provocation”  —   he is strafed by Russian fighter jets. Speaking of provocations, in . ..       (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   August . .. Donald Trump goes to Mexico, having been informed by his team of   advisers that this is where Mexicans come from. He meets with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, and although he does not try to convince Peña Nieto that Mexico should pay for the huge imaginary wall that he has promised to build, Trump does demonstrate his legendary prowess as a   businessman by negotiating what he describes as “a fantastic price” on a souvenir sombrero that he claims is “easily four feet in diameter. ” Meanwhile newly released State Department emails cause some people to suggest that the reason a variety of dodgy foreign businesspeople and nations gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state was that they expected  —   Get a load of THIS wacky   conspiracy theory!  —   to receive special access to or favors from the U. S. government. Hillary has no choice but to roll her eyes and laugh in a violently unnatural manner at this latest attempt to use these discredited smear tactics to prevent her, a historic and lifelong woman, from fighting for working families as well as working for fighting families. Abroad, the Summer Olympics open in Brazil amid dire warnings about Zika, riots, muggers, muggers with Zika, and windsurfers being attacked by predatory oceangoing feces. But the games for the most part go smoothly, the biggest glitch being when one of the diving pools mysteriously turns a dark, murky green. The mystery is finally solved when the pool is drained, revealing a Russian nuclear submarine, which Russia insists is in international waters. In the athletic competition, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt becomes the first athlete ever to win the men’s   final wearing  . But the U. S. team dominates the Games, with the most memorable performance coming from a team of athletes led by swimmer and rocket scientist Ryan Lochte competing in the   Gas Station Wall Pee. Elsewhere in sports, the opening of the National Football League season provides a   diversion to Americans who are sick of being bitterly divided over politics and welcome the opportunity to be bitterly divided over how players respond to the national anthem. Speaking of bitter, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   September . .. Clinton and Trump square off in the first presidential debate, which leads to a national conversation about an issue of vital concern to all Americans, namely the alleged weight gain of Alicia Machado, Miss Universe of 1996. This topic is raised by Clinton in an obvious attempt to bait Trump into wasting valuable campaign time talking about something that cannot possibly benefit him, so naturally Trump, who by his own admission has an extremely high IQ, latches on to it like a barnacle on the Titanic. He focuses on the former Miss Venezuela with laserlike intensity for the better part of a week before getting back to his previous campaign strategy of engaging in bitterly personal Twitter feuds, often with other Republicans. But it is also not a totally great month for Clinton, who appears to collapse while being helped into a van after hastily leaving a   memorial ceremony. Her campaign, responding with the transparency, openness and candor for which it is famous, initially downplays the incident, saying that Clinton felt “overheated. ” Ninety minutes later she appears outside her daughter’s apartment building and tells reporters, “I’m feeling great. ” But later that afternoon her physician releases a statement saying that two days earlier, Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia. This leads to renewed speculation about Clinton’s health, which is quickly quelled by a vast army of Clinton campaign officials, surrogates, allies, lackeys, henchpersons and media flunkies, all heavily armed with talking points and declaring, in unison, that she has no undeclared health problems and is going to power through this minor, pesky   pneumonia, which is old news and will not distract her from being a historic person of gender with a lifelong commitment to fighting for working etc. Speaking of overheating, Samsung announces a recall of all Galaxy Note 7 phones after an attempt to rebrand them as “smart charcoal lighters” meets with consumer resistance. Adding to Samsung’s woes are reports that some of its   washers have exploded, although the company insists that the machines are “perfectly safe when operated using the delicate cycle,” provided that “there are no humans nearby. ” In other technology news, Apple announces the release of the iPhone 7, which is basically the iPhone 6 with the added convenience of not having a headphone jack. The marketing slogan is “At Least It Doesn’t Burst Into Flames. ” In entertainment news, “Game of Thrones” once again wins the coveted Emmy Award for Drama Series With the Most Naked People. But for sheer drama, no TV show can compare with what happens to the American political system in . ..      (Illustration by Mark   The Washington Post)   October . .. when the U. S. presidential election, until now a cross between farce and soap opera, mutates into a   horror show. The early part of the month goes badly for Trump with the release of a 2005 video in which he talks about kissing and groping women, which according to him he can get away with because he’s a star who uses Tic Tacs.  Trump quickly apologizes for the video, noting that (a) it was recorded long ago when he was just 59 years old; (b) his remarks were “  banter” such as you would hear in any locker room in America occupied by morally deficient billionaire pigs; (c) Bill Clinton did way worse things; and (d) WHAT ABOUT BENGHAZI? But the story does not go away. Over the next week Trump is accused of improper groping by enough women to form a professional softball league. Trump responds to these allegations with a   defense: Prong One: These women are lying. Prong Two: ALL of them. They are LIARS. Prong Three: They are frankly not attractive enough to be groped by a star of his magnitude. Prong Four: The election is rigged! Prong Five: WHAT ABOUT BILL CLINTON AND BENGHAZI? Meanwhile the Clinton campaign is dealing with a steady stream of WikiLeaks emails suggesting that the Clinton Foundation is dedicated to humanitarian relief in the same sense that the Soprano family was dedicated to waste management. But this kind of scandal is   stuff for the Clinton campaign, whose slogan has slowly morphed from “Stronger Together” into “At Least She’s Predictably Corrupt. ” As the month wears on and Trump continues to flail away unconvincingly at his alleged groping victims, it appears more and more likely that Clinton has established herself, with just enough voters, as the least loathsome choice in this hideous,   nightmare of an election. And then, just when we thought it could not get any weirder or any worse, we are hit with the mother of all October surprises in the form of the incurable genital wart on the body politic known as Anthony Weiner. While probing Weiner’s laptop (Har!) for evidence of alleged sexting with an underaged girl, the FBI reportedly discovers thousands of emails that were sent from or to Hillary Clinton’s private email server, which apparently had a higher Internet profile than Taylor Swift.  FBI Director James Comey sends a letter informing Congress that the FBI is taking another look at the email issue.  In a display of the intellectual integrity that has made our political class so respected by ordinary citizens, all the Democrats and allied pundits who praised Comey in July as a courageous public servant instantly swap positions with all the Republicans and allied pundits who said he was a cowardly hack.  This new development sends the political world into Full Freakout Mode, with   political analysts forced to change their underwear on an hourly basis. Meanwhile millions of critical swing voters switch from “undecided” to “suicidal. ” In    October news: ● A government report concludes that the Affordable Care Act (Motto: “If You Like Your Doctor, Maybe You’ll Like Your New Doctor”) is going to cost many people a lot more, while continuing to provide the same range of customizable consumer options as a parking meter. ● In a chilling reminder of the nation’s technological vulnerability, a series of cyberattacks disrupts popular Internet sites such as Twitter and Netflix, forcing millions of Americans to make eye contact with one another. ● In yet another blow to Samsung, the Federal Aviation Administration announces that it will not permit commercial aircraft to fly over states known to contain Galaxy Note 7s. ● In the arts, Bob Dylan refuses to answer his doorbell, forcing members of the Swedish Academy to leave the Nobel Prize for literature in his mailbox. The month ends on an upbeat note as Americans celebrate Halloween, a welcome escape from the relentless drumbeat of bad news, as evidenced by this FoxNews. com headline, which we swear we are not making up: “Some Florida parents plan to arm themselves while going    over clown concerns. ” Speaking of treats, in . ..      (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   November . .. the Chicago Cubs win the World Series. Finally! Yay! What a fun month! Okay, that’s our summary of November. Now it’s time to move along to the events of . ..     No, that would be wrong. This is supposed to be a review of the whole year, warts and all, and we have to face reality. So let’s all take a deep breath, compose ourselves and go back to . ..  November . .. which begins with yet another letter to congressional leaders from FBI Director Comey, who lately has generated more correspondence than Publishers Clearing House. This time, he says, concerning the newly discovered emails on Anthony Weiner’s laptop: never mind. This forces Republicans and Democrats to again swap positions on whether Comey is a courageous patriot or total scum. For a brief period members of Congress are so confused about who stands where that they are in real danger of accidentally working together and accomplishing something. Fortunately before this happens the two sides are able to sort things out and resume being bitterly deadlocked. As Election Day approaches, a consensus forms among the experts in the   complex, based on a vast array of demographic and scientific polling data evaluated with sophisticated analytical tools. These experts, who have made lucrative careers out of going on TV and explaining America to Americans, overwhelmingly agree that Hillary Clinton will win, possibly in a landslide, and this could very well mean the end of the Republican Party. The Explainers are very sure of this, nodding in unison while smiling in bemusement at the pathetic delusions of the Trump people. Unfortunately, it turns out that a large sector of the American public has not been brought up to speed on all this expert analysis. And so it comes to pass that the unthinkable happens, in the form of . ..    No, damn it! We have to do this! What happens in . ..  November . .. is that Donald Trump is elected president of the United States, unless this turns out to be one of those really vivid dreams, like the one where you’re at the dentist but you’re naked and your dentist is Bette Midler and spiders keep coming out of your mouth. Trump’s victory stuns the nation. Not since the darkest days of the Civil War have so many Americans unfriended each other on Facebook. Some even take the extreme step of writing “open letters. ” Angry, traumatized protesters cry, march, shout, smash windows, set fires  —   and that’s just the New York Times editorial board. Leading celebrities who vowed to leave the country if Trump won immediately start making plans to . .. okay, to not actually leave the country per se, but next time they definitely will and YOU’LL BE SORRY. In Washington, Democrats who believed in a strong president wielding power via executive orders instantly exchange these deeply held convictions with Republicans who until Election Day at roughly 10 p. m. Eastern time believed fervently in filibusters and limited government. On TV, the professional Explainers, having failed spectacularly to predict what just happened, pause for a period of somber and contrite   lasting close to 15 minutes before they begin the crucial work of explaining to the rest of us what will happen next.  Joe Biden lies awake nights, staring at the ceiling.  Meanwhile a somber Trump, preparing to assume the most powerful office on the planet, puts the pettiness of the campaign behind him and  —   facing a world rife with turmoil  —   gets down to the   work of taking Twitter shots at the cast of “Hamilton. ” He also begins assembling a Cabinet that  —   reflecting the diversity of the nation he has been elected to lead  —   includes several  . The   also receives classified briefings, during which he learns, among other things, that there are a LOT of foreign countries, including some where he does not even have golf courses. Meanwhile the Democrats, now on a   losing streak that has cost them the presidency, both houses of Congress and a majority of the state legislatures, desperately seek an explanation for their party’s failures. After a hard, critical look in the mirror, they are forced, reluctantly, to stop seeking scapegoats and place the blame where it belongs: the electoral college, the Russians, Facebook and of course James Comey. In the month’s biggest   news, the death of Fidel Castro is greeted with expressions of sorrow from several dozen world leaders who never had to live under his rule, and tears of happiness from many thousands of Cubans who did. As the bitter and tumultuous month finally draws to a close, Americans briefly stop fighting over politics and come together to celebrate Thanksgiving in the same way the Pilgrims did in 1623: fighting over   TVs. But the focus turns back to politics in  …          (Illustration by Mark Ward   The Washington Post)   December . .. during which Trump continues to dominate the news, his face appearing   on every channel including the Food Network, even when the TV is turned off. Early in the month the   ruffles the feathers of the Chinese government when  —   in what is viewed as a departure from diplomatic protocol  —   he texts Beijing a poop emoji. Also he threatens a drone strike against Alec Baldwin. But the big story continues to be the Trump Cabinet. His choice for secretary of defense is James N. “Mad Dog” Mattis, who impresses Trump with his sophisticated understanding of modern military strategy and also by biting the head off a live hamster. Most of the drama, however, involves the herd of hopefuls auditioning for secretary of state, including former Trump foe Mitt Romney, who dons wingtip kneepads for his pilgrimage to Trump Tower, after which he explains to the press that his previous criticisms of Trump have been taken out of context, particularly his use of the phrase “scum toad,” which Romney says he meant “in the spirit of constructive dialogue. ” Chris Christie dines alone in a Golden Corral in Freehold, N. J. pondering whether to accept the ambassadorship to Belize. The New York Times and Washington Post, seeking to improve their understanding of   America, partner with TV network news divisions to create “Operation Outreach,” in which teams of reporters will travel to   regions carrying rucksacks full of chewing tobacco and moon pies, which they will trade with the natives in return for colorful quotes about their political views, religious beliefs, sex practices involving livestock, etc. Meanwhile abroad: ● French President François Hollande announces that he will not seek reelection, leading professional pollsters to predict, based on scientific analysis of the data, that he will win in a landslide. ● In a disturbing development, North Korean troops mass near the South Korean border armed with what intelligence sources identify as “a large quantity of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s. ” Finally, mercifully, 2016 draws to a close. On New Year’s Eve, a festive crowd gathers in Times Square, and millions more tune in on TV, to watch the ball drop that marks the dawn of the new year. This is one of the great traditions that connect us as a nation, and it serves to remind us that, although we disagree on many things, we are all part of the same big family  —   the American family  —   and when all is said and done, we hate each other.  This is what we are thinking as the big lighted ball begins to slowly descend the pole, traveling roughly two feet before it is vaporized by Russian fighter jets. Happy new year, fellow Americans. It’s going to be exciting.  Dave Barry is a Pulitzer   humor columnist and author. His latest book is “Best. State. Ever.: A Florida Man Defends His Homeland. ”  Email us at wpmagazine@washpost. com.

"            Donald J. Trump held a news conference Wednesday, his first since the November election. He was introduced by his incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, and vice   Mike Pence.  Here’s the full transcript, along with our annotations. To see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. To make your own, sign up for a Genius account.  SPICER: Morning. Thanks for being here (ph). (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States. It’s an opportunity to be here today to allow the   to take your questions. After the   makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D. C. with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will    who structured the agreements pursuant to the president’s business arrangements and she will give brief remarks. Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night. It’s frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a   blog that was openly hostile to the  ’s campaign to drop highly salacious and flat out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office. According to BuzzFeed’s own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. The executive editor of the New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, ”Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.” SPICER: The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, and Carter Page. Carter Page is an individual who the   does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time. We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague. In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague. A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at    at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game. One report now suggested apparently it’s another Michael Cohen. For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful. With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence. (APPLAUSE) PENCE: We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I’m even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again. (APPLAUSE) Now, the  ’s leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. But as the Chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet. Nineteen of the 21 Cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a    it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. Perhaps that’s why there’s been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration. You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be. But with freedom comes responsibility. And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the   and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it. (APPLAUSE) But today, we’ll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again. And we’ll hear from the   about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today. So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the   of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Thank you very much. It’s very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on a almost daily basis. I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it’s good to be with you. TRUMP: We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that    and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released. But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years    a couple in particular    and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station. So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room. I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional    so incredibly professional, that I’ve just gone up a notch as to what I think of you. OK? All right. We’ve had some great news over the last couple of weeks. I’ve been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies    big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest. You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they’re going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant. I appreciate that from Ford. I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler. I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be. I think a lot of people will be following. I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. We’ve got to get our drug industry back. Our drug industry has been disastrous. They’re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs, but they don’t make them here, to a large extent. And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they’re getting away with murder. Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there’s very little bidding on drugs. We’re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don’t bid properly and we’re going to start bidding and we’re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. And we’re going to do that with a lot of other industries. I’m very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the   you’ve been reading about it. And it’s way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. I don’t like that. And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. I’ve really gotten to know them well. And we’re going to do some big things on the   program, and perhaps the   program. And we’re going to get those costs way down and we’re going to get the plane to be even better. And we’re going to have some competition and it’s going to be a beautiful thing. So, we’ve been very, very much involved, and other things. We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. There are no    they’re going to do tremendous things    tremendous things in this country. And they’re very excited. And I will say, if the election didn’t turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. They would not be in my office. They would not be in anybody else’s office. They’d be building and doing things in other countries. So, there’s a great spirit going on right now. A spirit that many people have told me they’ve never seen before, ever. We’re going to create jobs. I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. And I mean that, I really    I’m going to work very hard on that. We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we’re going to do a real job. And I’m very proud of what we’ve done. And we haven’t even gotten there yet. I look very much forward to the inauguration. It’s going to be a beautiful event. We have great talent, tremendous talent. And we have the    all of the bands    or most of the bands are from the different    from the different segments of the military. And I’ve heard some of these bands over the years, they’re incredible. We’re going to have a very, very elegant day. The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. And I think we’re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement. TRUMP: It’s a movement like the world has never seen before. It’s a movement that a lot of people didn’t expect. And even the polls    although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn’t. And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in. And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they’re gonna have a lot of security. They’re going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin. And we’ll do a news release in a little while. Tell you about David, he’s fantastic    he’s fantastic. He will do a truly great job. One of the commitments I made is that we’re gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. Our veterans have been treated horribly. They’re waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor   form of cancer and they can’t see a doctor. By the time they get to the doctor, they’re terminal. Not gonna happen, it’s not gonna happen. So, David is going to do a fantastic job. We’re going to be talking to a few people also to help David. And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have. And we’re gonna set up a    a group. These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. And they’re going to get together with their great doctors    Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved. Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. And we’re gonna straighten out the V. A. for our veterans. I’ve been promising that for a long time and it’s something I feel very, very strongly. So, you’ll get the information on David. And I think you’ll be very impressed with the job he does. We looked long and hard. We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. But we had a lot of talent. And we think this election will be something that will, with time    with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good ’cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly. OK, questions? Yes, John (ph)? QUESTION: (Inaudible) so much. TRUMP: Thank you. QUESTION: Appreciate it. A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we’re looking for further clarification on. TRUMP: Sure. QUESTION: First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the   summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC? And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States? TRUMP: OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. So, I’m not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting. And    but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. And I will say, again, I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting. It’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen. And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. It was a group of opponents that got together    sick people    and they put that crap together. So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. It should have never been    number one, shouldn’t have even entered paper. But it should have never have been released. But I read what was released and I think it’s a disgrace. I think it’s an absolute disgrace. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. And I    I can say that you know when    when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn’t make a big deal out of that. That was something that was extraordinary. That was probably China. We had    we had much hacking going on. And one of the things we’re gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we’ve assembled. You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world    they were never in the same room together as a group. And we’re gonna put those minds together and we’re going to form a defense. TRUMP: And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked. They did a very poor job. They could’ve had hacking defense, which we had. And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through. We have to do that for our country. It’s very important. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin? TRUMP: Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. They said it totally never happened. Now, somebody would say, ”Oh, of course he’s gonna say that.” I respected the fact that he said that. And I    I’ll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would’ve released it; they would’ve been glad to release it. I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would’ve released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her. I mean what he said about her was horrible. If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would’ve fired him immediately or that person. Because what he said about her was horrible. But remember this: We talk about the hacking and hacking’s bad and it shouldn’t be done. But look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn’t report it? That’s a horrible thing. That’s a horrible thing. Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate    it would’ve been the biggest story in the history of stories. And they would’ve said immediately, ”You have to get out of the race.” Nobody even talked about it. It’s a very terrible thing. Yeah? QUESTION: Can I ask you a question, sir? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.  . On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. Do you accept that part of the finding? And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place? TRUMP: Well, if    if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia. Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time. The void was created, ISIS was formed. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks? That’s called an asset, not a liability. Now, I don’t know that I’m gonna get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there’s a good chance I won’t. And if I don’t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Give me a break. OK? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. President Obama. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies? TRUMP: Lemme just tell you what I do. When I leave our country, I’m a very   person, would you say? I am extremely careful. I’m surrounded by bodyguards. I’m surrounded by people. And I always tell them    anywhere, but I always tell them if I’m leaving this country, ”Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re gonna probably have cameras.” I’m not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category. And number one, ”I hope you’re gonna be good anyway. But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can’t see them and you won’t know. You better be careful, or you’ll be watching yourself on nightly television.” I tell this to people all the time. I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well    Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well. And I told many people, ”Be careful, because you don’t wanna see yourself on television. Cameras all over the place.” And again, not just Russia, all over. Does anyone really believe that story? I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. But first, I have to   on some of these Russian remarks. Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? TRUMP: So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we’ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. I have assets that are    and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt    I have very low debt. But I have no loans with Russia at all. And I thought that was important to put out. I certified that. So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings. We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don’t want to because I think that would be a conflict. So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals. Now, I have to say one other thing. Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy. And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai    a number of deals and I turned it down. I didn’t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a   situation because I’m president, which is    I didn’t know about that until about three months ago, but it’s a nice thing to have. But I don’t want to take advantage of something. I have something that others don’t have, Vice President Pence also has it. I don’t think he’ll need it, I have a feeling he’s not going to need it. But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president. It was many, many years old, this is for presidents. Because they don’t want presidents getting    I understand they don’t want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don’t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that. You can’t do that in any other capacity. But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company    the country. I’d do a very good job, but I don’t want to do that. Now, all of these papers that you see here    yes, go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified? And will you release your tax returns to prove what you’re saying about no deals in Russia? TRUMP: I’m not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they’re under audit. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. since the ’70’s has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir. .. TRUMP: You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They’re the only who ask. QUESTION: You don’t think the American public is concerned about it? TRUMP: No I don’t think so. I won, when I became president. No, I don’t think they care at all. I don’t think they care at all. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I think you care    I think you care. First of all, you learn very little to a tax return. What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. We’re in many, many countries, and I’m very proud of it. And what I’m going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company. They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They’re not going to discuss it with me. Again, I don’t have to do this. They’re not going to discuss it with me. And with that, I’m going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she’s going to go    these papers are just some of the many documents that I’ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons. (CROSSTALK) DILLON: Good morning. It’s my honor and privilege to be here today at   Trump’s request. He’s asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he’s taking. As you know, the business empire built by   Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president. But at that time, no one was so concerned.   Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people’s business and not his own. To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company. He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests. DILLON: As he said, he’s voluntarily taking this on. The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it’s simply inapplicable by its terms. And this is not just our interpretation. It’s Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president. Even so,   Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law. Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H. W. Bush’s Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center. Mr. Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. He’s here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization. I’m gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the   is taking. First,   Trump’s investments and business assets commonly known as the    as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th. Here is just some of the paperwork that’s taking care of those actions. Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg. Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by   Trump. Further, at the  ’s direction, the trust agreement provides    that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.   Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.   Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities. Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization. As she and Jared move their family to D. C. Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools. The   has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics. Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of   Productions and Goods. Things like Trump Tower,    all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust. Through instructions in the trust agreement,   trust      Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for   Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric. DILLON: The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump’s presidency. New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. The   will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. Because any new deal could    and I emphasize could    be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues. The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval. To further reinforce the wall that we are building between   Trump and the Trump Organization,   Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. There will be no separate business by business accounting. Another step that   Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to   Trump’s role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency. In sum, all of these actions    complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights    will sever   Trump’s presidency from the Trump Organization. Some have asked questions. Why not divest? Why not just sell everything? Form of blind trust. And I’d like to turn to addressing some of those questions now. Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. In fact, it would exacerbate them. The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization’s assets. If   Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency. Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the  . And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.   Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn’t even feasible. Some people have suggested that the   sell the business to his adult children. This would require massive   debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. And if the   were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now. Some people have suggested that the Trump    that   Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company. Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a  . It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization. Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. President Trump can’t unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized. DILLON: Further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the Trump Organization. The approach that he is taking allows Don and Eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. And this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. It creates a complete separation from   Trump    it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal. I’m going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. That’s a word I think we’ve all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. And we’re gonna describe some other actions that   Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. Emoluments comes from the Constitution. The Constitution says ”officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.” The   Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. Instead, it would have been thought of as a    exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. But since   Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm’  transactions that the   has absolutely nothing to do with and isn’t even aware of. These people are wrong. This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It’s not an emolument. The Constitution does not require   Trump to do anything here. But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires. So,   Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury. This way, it is the American people who will profit. In sum, I and  ’s (sic) other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we’ve outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the   and his family. We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the  ’s desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure. The American people were well    well aware of   Trump’s business empire and financial interests when they voted. Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.   Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) (CROSSTALK) DILLON: You’re welcome. My pleasure. Yes (ph). Don’t want to lose your note. Thank you. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Here you go, you (ph). DILLON: Thank you. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? Thank you. Mr. Trump, (inaudible) from America News. What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your    your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I    I really think that when you watch what’s going on with what’s happening in    I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson. I think it’s brilliant what he’s doing and what he’s saying. I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. And he was brilliant. And what people don’t know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama. And he was brilliant yesterday. So, I really think that they are    I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together. And we’ve been hearing that from so many people. People are so happy. You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil. When there was a find, he would get it. When they needed something, he would be there. A friend of mine who’s very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm    big supporter    he said there’s nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson. And that’s what we want. That’s what I want to bring to government. I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we’re way behind. We don’t make good deals any more. I say it all the time in speeches. We don’t make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. Our trade deals are a disaster. TRUMP: We have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis    hundreds of billions with China on trade and trade imbalance, with Japan, with Mexico, with just about everybody. We don’t make good deals anymore. So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they’re smart. And that’s what I’d put, I’m very proud of the Cabinet, I think they’re doing very well. It’s very interesting how it’s going, but it’s    I think they’re doing very, very well. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. a quick   on    on Russia, sir. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.  . I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Can you be specific on what guidance you’re giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked. QUESTION: ( ) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law? TRUMP: You’re gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you’re gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. Obamacare is a complete and total disaster. They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. In some cases, they guide you incorrectly. In most cases, you realize what’s happened, it’s imploding as we sit. Some states have over a hundred percent increase and ’17 and I said this two years ago, ’17 is going to be the bad year. It’s going to be catastrophic. Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people. We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare. We don’t wanna own it, we don’t wanna own it politically. They own it right now. So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in ’17 and believe me, we’d get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. We’re going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary’s approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. It’ll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour. So we’re gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. And we’re gonna get a health bill passed, we’re gonna get health care taken care of in this country. You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can’t even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high. Obamacare is the Democrats problem. We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. We’re doing them a tremendous service by doing it. We could sit back and let them hang with it. We are doing the Democrats a great service. So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we’ll be filing a plan. And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times. And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare. We’re going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   can we just ask you    sir, sir. .. QUESTION:   Trump. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Mr. President    which one? TRUMP: I was going right here. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   Trump, Jon Steinberg (ph) from Cheddar. When you look at all the meetings that you’ve had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce? And then my   question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts? TRUMP: Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that’s only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier. And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs. And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. But those were    that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it’s always tough when they’re building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement. TRUMP: So I wanna thank United Technologies. But we’ve been meeting with a lot of companies. But what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won, for good reason, it’s not going to happen that way anymore. You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you’re going to build that plant in Mexico and you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you’re making, and you’re going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border    not a weak border like it is    we don’t even have a border. It’s an open sieve. But you’re going to sell through a very strong border    not going to happen. You’re going to pay a very large border tax. So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina. You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan. You can do anywhere    you’ve got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. So it’s not like, oh, gee, I’m taking the competition away. You’ve got a lot of places you can move. And I don’t care, as along as it’s within the United States, the borders of the United States. There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. And you’d have millions more workers right now in the United States that are    96 million really wanting a job and they can’t get. You know that story. The real number    that’s the real number. So, that’s the way it is. OK. Go ahead. QUESTION:   I have a question about the Supreme Court and border security. But I also wanted to ask you about something you said on Twitter this morning. Are we living in Nazi Germany? What were you driving at there? Do you have a problem with the intelligence community? And on the Supreme Court, what’s your timeline? You said a while ago you were down to four. Have you conducted those interviews yet? What’s your timeline for nominating? And on the border fence, it now appears clear U. S. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. What is your plan to. .. TRUMP: That’s not clear at all. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. to get Mexico to pay for it? TRUMP: I’ve got it. Do you have any more? (LAUGHTER) On the fence    it’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall. I could wait about a     until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but I don’t want to wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through Congress for the wall to begin. I don’t feel like waiting a year or a    . We’re going to start building. Mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. That will happen, whether it’s a tax or whether it’s a payment    probably less likely that it’s a payment. But it will happen. So, remember this, OK? I would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. I would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? And people would all scream out    25, 000, 30, 000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like Trump has had. You know that. You don’t like to report that, but that’s OK. OK, now he agrees. Finally, he agrees. But I say who is going to pay for the wall? And they will scream out, ”Mexico.” Now, reports went out last week    oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. What’s the difference? I want to get the wall started. I don’t want to wait a     until I make my deal with Mexico. And we probably will have a deal sooner than that. And by the way, Mexico has been so nice, so nice. I respect the government of Mexico. I respect the people of Mexico. I love the people of Mexico. I have many people from Mexico working for me. They’re phenomenal people. The government of Mexico is terrific. I don’t blame them for what’s happened. I don’t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. I wish our politicians were so smart. Mexico has taken advantage of the United States. I don’t blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of Mexico. What I say is we shouldn’t have allowed that to happen. It’s not going to happen anymore. So, in order to get the wall started, Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed. OK? Supreme Court judge. So, as you know, I have a list of 20. I’ve gone through them. We’ve met with numerous candidates. They’re outstanding in every case. They were largely recommended and highly recommended by Federalist Society. Jim DeMint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he’s a fantastic guy. TRUMP: So between Leo and Jim DeMint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. I’ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the United States Supreme Court, a replacement for the great, great Justice Scalia. That will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. So within about two weeks, probably the second week. I consider the first day because we’ll also be doing some    some pretty good signings and I think what we’ll do is we’ll wait until Monday. That will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on Friday, because on Friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then Saturday, as you know, we’re having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. So our first day    and you’ll all be invited to the signings, but we’ll be doing some pretty good signings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday, and then also the next week. And you’re all invited. But on the Supreme Court, I’ll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which I very strongly believe in. I think it’s one of the reasons I got elected. I think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the Supreme Court, so I think it was a very, very big decision as to why I was elected. QUESTION: The tweet that you had this morning about are we living in Nazi Germany, what were you driving at there? What are you trying to tell the American public? TRUMP: I think it was disgraceful    disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that    and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. I think it’s a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. As far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they’re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. And as far as CNN going out of their way to build it up    and by the way, we just found out I was coming down. Michael Cohen    I was being    Michael Cohen is a very talented lawyer. He’s a good lawyer in my firm. It was just reported that it wasn’t this Michael Cohen they we’re talking about. So all night long it’s Michael Cohen. I said, ”I want to see your passport.” He brings his passport to my office. I say, hey, wait a minute. He didn’t leave the country. He wasn’t out of the country. They had Michael Cohen of the Trump Organization was in Prague. It turned out to be a different Michael Cohen. It’s a disgrace what took place. It’s a disgrace and I think they ought to apologize to start with Michael Cohen. QUESTION: Since you’re attacking us, can you give us a question? Mr.      TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr.   since you are attacking our news organization. .. TRUMP: Not you. QUESTION: Can you give us a chance? TRUMP: Your organization is terrible. QUESTION: You are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? Sir, can you. .. TRUMP: Quiet. QUESTION: Mr.   can you say. .. TRUMP: He’s asking a question, don’t be rude. Don’t be rude. QUESTION: Can you give us a question since you’re attacking us? Can you give us a question? TRUMP: Don’t be rude. No, I’m not going to give you a question. I’m not going to give you a question. QUESTION: Can you state. .. TRUMP: You are fake news. Go ahead. QUESTION: Sir, can you state categorically that nobody    no, Mr.   that’s not appropriate. TRUMP: Go ahead. (APPLAUSE) QUESTION: Do you think President Obama went too far with the sanctions he put on Russia after the hacking? TRUMP: I don’t think he went too far. No. QUESTION: Will you roll them back? What do you think of Lindsey Graham’s plan to send you a bill for. .. TRUMP: Plans to send me a bill for what? QUESTION: Tougher sanctions. TRUMP: I hadn’t heard Lindsey Graham was going to do that. Lindsey Graham. I’ve been competing with him for a long time. He is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. I didn’t realize Lindsey Graham is still at it. That’s all right. I think Lindsey Graham is a nice guy. I’ve heard that he is a nice guy and I’ve been hearing it. Go ahead. Go ahead. You’ve been waiting. QUESTION: As far as we understand, the intelligence community. .. TRUMP: Stand up. QUESTION: From BBC news. Ian Pannell from BBC news. TRUMP: BBC news. That’s another beauty. QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you. As far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. If they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position. .. TRUMP: There’s nothing they could come back with. QUESTION: Can you. .. TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) published fake news and all the problems that we’ve seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here? TRUMP: Well, I don’t recommend reforms. I recommend people that are    that have some moral compass. You know, I’ve been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they’re talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. But I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news more so than anybody. I could name them, but I won’t bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. They’re very, very dishonest people, but I think it’s just something we’re going to have to live with. TRUMP: I guess the advantage I have is that I can speak back. When it happens to somebody that doesn’t have this    doesn’t have that kind of a megaphone, they can’t speak back. It’s a very sad thing. I’ve seen people destroyed. I’ve seen people absolutely destroyed. And I think it’s very unfair. So, all I can ask for is honest reporters. Yes? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I just wanted to follow up on the questions about the U. S. intelligence community. And be very clear about what you’re saying. Do you trust your U. S. intelligence officials? And what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you’re actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? TRUMP: Intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. We are going to be putting in, as you know, Mr. Pompeo and others, you know the Senator Dan Coats. We’re going to be putting in some outstanding people. Within 90 days, they’re going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. I want them to cover this situation. I also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly    because we’re hacked by everybody    you know, the United States, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it’s number 17, in terms of protection. If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries    they put this in the category of an industry    the United States is last in terms of protecting, let’s say, hacking defense. Like we had a great hacking defense at the Republican National Committee. That’s why we weren’t hacked. By the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren’t able to hack. And I think I get some credit because I told Reince, and Reince did a phenomenal job, but I said I want strong hacking defense. The Democratic National Committee didn’t do that. Maybe that’s why the country runs so badly that way. But I will tell you    wait    wait    wait, let me finish. Within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena    fairly new phenomena because the United States is hacked by everybody. That includes Russia and China and everybody    everybody. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead    go ahead. QUESTION: Mr.   you said, just now, that you believe Russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the DNC and Jon Podesta’s   et cetera. TRUMP: All right, but you know what, it could have been others also. QUESTION: But why did you spend weeks undermining U. S. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement? TRUMP: Well, I think it’s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. I think it’s pretty sad. First of all, it’s illegal. You know, these are    these are classified and certified meetings and reports. I’ll tell you what does happen. I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebody’s leaking it out. So, there’s    maybe it’s my office. Maybe in my office because I have a lot of people, a lot of great people. Maybe it’s them. And what I did is I said I won’t tell anybody. I’m going to have a meeting and I won’t tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. And what happened is I had my meeting. Nobody knew, not even Rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn’t know    I didn’t tell her. Nobody knew. The meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. And immediately the word got out that I had a meeting. So, I don’t want that    I don’t want that. It’s very unfair to the country. It’s very unfair to our country; what’s happened. That report should have never    first of all, it shouldn’t have been printed because it’s not worth the paper it’s written on. And I thank the New York Times for saying that. I thank a lot of different people for saying that. But, I will tell you, that should never, ever happen. OK. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Thank you, Mr.   can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with Russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. And if you do indeed believe that Russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to Vladimir Putin right now? TRUMP: He shouldn’t be doing it. He won’t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I’m leading than when other people have led it. You will see that. Russia will respect our country more. He shouldn’t have done it. I don’t believe that he will be doing it more now. We have to work something out, but it’s not just Russia. Take a look at what’s happened. You don’t report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that’s because we have no defense. That’s because we’re run by people that don’t know what they’re doing. TRUMP: Russia will have far greater respect for our country when I’m leading it and I believe and I hope    maybe it won’t happen, it’s possible. But I won’t be giving (ph) a little reset button like Hillary. Here, press this piece of plastic. A guy looked at her like what is she doing? There’s no reset button. We’re either going to get along or we’re not. I hope we get along, but if we don’t, that’s possible too. But Russia and other countries    and other countries, including China, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the South China Sea by building their massive fortress, total. Russia, China, Japan, Mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. I want to thank everybody. So this is all    just so you understand, these papers    because I’m not sure that was explained properly. But these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that I hope at the end of eight years, I’ll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I’ll say, ”You’re fired.”   everybody.  ."
"   In Donald Trump’s final days on the campaign trail, he promised his supporters that “every dream you ever dreamed for your country” will come true if he becomes president  —   one of dozens of sweeping promises he made and is now expected to fulfill.  In January, I compiled a list of 76 campaign promises Trump had made. Since then, the list has grown to 282, collected from Trump’s speeches, public comments, tweets and campaign and transition websites.   JOBS  1. Create at least 25 million jobs and “be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. ”      Here are some of the most memorable campaign promises Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made since he declared his candidacy in June 2015. (Sarah   Washington Post)   2. Bring back manufacturing jobs from China, Mexico, Japan and elsewhere. States that can expect a rush of jobs include Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, New York and Virginia.  3. Encourage manufacturers to build or grow factories in the United States with tax incentives. 4. Refuse to eat another Oreo until Nabisco fully moves production back to the United States from Mexico. 5. Tell Ford’s president that unless he cancels plans to build a massive plant in Mexico, the auto company will face a 35 percent tax on cars imported into the United States. Trump is confident he can get this done before taking office. (Trump has twice incorrectly said this has already happened.) 6. “Get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries. ” 7. Call the executives at the parent company of Carrier, an   manufacturer that is closing a plant in Indiana and moving to Mexico, and threaten to impose a 35 percent tariff on air conditioners imported into the United States. Trump predicts the company will say: “Sir, we’ve decided to stay in the United States. ” 8. Bring back the steel industry to Pennsylvania and use   steel in all federal infrastructure projects.  9. Make the auto industry in Michigan “bigger and better and stronger than ever before. ” Trump plans to return to the state each time a new factory or auto plant opens.  10. Bring the coal industry back to life in the Appalachian Mountain region.  11. Require employers to recruit “from the unemployment office  —   not the immigration office. ” 12. Leave the federal minimum wage at $7. 25 per hour, which is already too high.  13. Raise the federal minimum wage to $10 per hour, as $7. 25 is too low and “the minimum wage has to go up. ” 14. Allow states to set their own minimum wage.  15. “Under a Trump presidency, the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them. ”   APPROACH TO THE PRESIDENCY  16. “I’m going to be so presidential, you’re going to be so bored. ” He might also quit tweeting.  17. “I refuse to be politically correct. ” 18. “My only special interest is you, the American people,” not major donors, the party or corporations. 19. “Be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. ” 20. Pass on the president’s annual salary of $400, 000.  21. “I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off. ” Trump will make time for golf but promises to “always play with leaders of countries and people that can help us. ” 22. “I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. ” (Trump has criticized Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who was injured while riding a bicycle amid the Iran negotiations.) 23. “In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. . . . When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win. ” 24. “If I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce it. ” 25. “I don’t settle cases. I don’t do it. ” (This month Trump settled a fraud lawsuit against Trump University for $25 million.)  26. Fully focus on the presidency and put his three oldest children  —   Donald Trump Jr. Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump  —   in charge of running his company. (Trump has yet to take steps to fully isolate himself from his business, and his three oldest children have played a major role in his transition team. In an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, Trump noted that he could legally continue running his business.)   TAXES  27. Release his tax returns as soon as an Internal Revenue Service audit is complete.  28. Pass the Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, which will reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four and lower income taxes for all. The highest earners would pay a 25 percent tax. Individuals earning less than $25, 000 per year or couples earning less than $50, 000 would not be charged income tax, although they would have to file a   form with the IRS that states: “I win. ”  29. Lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and get rid of most corporate tax loopholes or incentives. Allow corporations a   window to transfer money being held overseas, charging a   10 percent tax.  30. Eliminate the carried interest loophole for Wall Street, the federal estate tax, the alternative minimum tax and the   marriage penalty that affects some   earners. Continue to allow taxpayers to deduct mortgage interest and charitable donations from their taxes.  31. “We are going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan. ”   TRADE  32. Renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. 33. On the first day in office, pull out of the   Partnership, President Obama’s signature trade deal linking countries around the Pacific Rim. 34. Negotiate trade deals with individual countries instead of regions. Trump would gather together the “smartest negotiators in the world” and assign them each a country. Billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn would be in charge of trade negotiations with China and Japan.  35. Identify all foreign trading abuses that affect American workers and “use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. ” This would include cracking down on “sweatshops in Mexico that undercut U. S. workers. ”  36. Impose new taxes on imports into the country from companies that used to be based in the United States. Trump’s most frequently cited number is 35 percent.  37. Impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese products imported into the United States.  ECONOMY AND FEDERAL BUDGET  38. “We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. ” Grow the nation’s economy by at least 4 percent per year, although Trump has also suggested he will boost growth to at least 6 percent per year  —   if not much higher. 39. Eliminate the $19 trillion national debt within eight years by “vigorously eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government, ending redundant government programs and growing the economy to increase tax revenues. ” 40. Never default on this debt, as the United States can “print the money” or renegotiate the amount owed with creditors, as the   “king of debt” has done with his private businesses.  41. Cut the budget by 20 percent by simply negotiating better prices or renegotiating existing deals. 42. Implement the “Penny Plan,” which each year would reduce net spending by 1 percent of the previous year’s total. Over 10 years, Trump says, this would reduce spending by almost $1 trillion. Defense and public safety spending would be exempt. 43. Immediately institute a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the workforce through attrition. There would be exceptions for those in the military, public safety and public health. 44. Order every federal government department head to “provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. ” Review each agency and then decrease the size of the “bloated government,” making it “leaner and more responsive to the public. ” 45. Stop spending money on space exploration until the United States can fix its potholes. Encourage private   companies to expand.  46. Stop   zombie spending, in which the government funds programs that have had their congressional authorization lapse. By cutting 5 percent of this spending, Trump estimates he could save almost $200 billion over 10 years. 47. Collect unpaid taxes, which Trump says could be as much as $385 billion per year. 48. Crack down on improper government payments, which Trump estimates exceed $135 billion per year. 49. Dismantle the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which aims to prevent the excessive   that led to the financial crisis and was signed into law by Obama in 2010.   REGULATION  50. Issue a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. For every new regulation that is added, two existing regulations must be eliminated. And those new regulations must pass this test: Is this regulation good for the American worker?   51. Order agency and department heads to identify all “needless   regulations” and then remove them.  HEALTH CARE  52. “Completely repeal” the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something “terrific” that is “so much better, so much better, so much better. ” Americans will have “great health care at a fraction of the cost. ” Trump plans to call Congress into a special session to do this, which will likely be unnecessary.  53. Eliminate the individual mandate, as “no person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. ” 54. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns. 55. Knock down the regulatory walls between states for health insurance, making plans available nationally instead of regionally. “Insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. ” 56. Expand use of Health Savings Accounts, which allow workers to save money for medical expenses without having to pay federal income tax on those funds. These payments will be allowed to accumulate and can be passed on to heirs. These funds can be used by any member of a family.  57. Encourage states to establish   pools to cover individuals who have not maintained continuous coverage. 58. Preserve Medicare and Medicaid but encourage states to root out fraud, waste and abuse. Provide states with block grants of Medicaid funds to provide more freedom in designing programs to assist   citizens.  59. Reduce the number of individuals on Medicaid   using the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Trump would also cut any health care offered to undocumented immigrants.  60. Make medical marijuana widely available to patients and allow states to decide if they want to fully legalize pot. 61. Push the Food and Drug Administration to more quickly approve the thousands of drugs it is currently reviewing. Trump also wants to “advance research and development in health care. ” 62. Bring down drug prices by importing cheaper medications from overseas and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices.  63. Require price transparency from   providers so patients can shop for the best prices. 64. “You will be able to choose your own doctor again. ”  BORDER SECURITY  65. Fully fund the construction of an “impenetrable physical wall” along the southern border with Mexico. The wall will be one foot taller than the Great Wall of China and “artistically beautiful,” constructed of hardened concrete, rebar and steel. The wall might cover only about 1, 000 miles of the nearly   border because of natural barriers, and Trump is open to using fencing in some places.  66. Make Mexico pay for the wall, “100 percent. ” If Mexico refuses, then the United States will impound remittance payments taken from the wages of undocumented immigrants, cut foreign aid, institute tariffs, cancel visas for Mexican business leaders and diplomats, and increase fees for visas,   cards and port use.  67. “Charge Mexico $100, 000 for every illegal that crosses that border because it’s trouble. ” 68. “Find and dislocate tunnels” along the border.  69. Supplement the wall with “    sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower. ” Hire an additional 5, 000 Border Patrol agents and expand the number of Border Patrol stations. 70. End “  . ” Anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed from the country.   IMMIGRATION  71. On the first day in office, terminate President Obama’s executive orders related to immigration.  72. Triple the number of U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.  73. Cancel federal funding to “sanctuary cities” that choose to not prosecute undocumented immigrants for being in the country illegally. 74. Create a Deportation Task Force. 75. Immediately deport undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime, are a member of a gang or pose a security threat. Trump estimates this is 2 million to 3 million people, although experts say the number is much lower. 76. Deport the millions of undocumented immigrants who are in the United States on an expired visa.  77. Deport undocumented immigrants who are benefiting from government assistance programs such as food stamps or housing assistance. 78. Issue detainers for undocumented immigrants who are arrested for any crime and immediately begin removal proceedings.  79. Do not grant amnesty to immigrants who are in the country illegally. “Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation,” and those wanting legal status will have to return to their home country and apply for reentry.  80. Restore the Secure Communities deportation program, which was ended by the Obama administration in 2014. The program was a partnership among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies that worked together to identify and deport undocumented immigrants.  81. “Expand and revitalize” use of Section 287( g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the Department of Homeland Security to deputize state and local law enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents.  82. On the first day in office, ask Congress to pass “Kate’s Law”  —   named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in San Francisco last summer  —   to “ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. ” 83. Introduce legislation named for Michael Davis Jr. and Danny Oliver, law enforcement officers in California who were killed by an undocumented immigrant in 2014. Such legislation would hasten the removal of “criminal immigrants and terrorists. ” (Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama introduced the   Act in June 2015, but it did not go anywhere.)  84. Stop issuing visas to countries that refuse to take back citizens who immigrated illegally to the United States. 85. Allow “tremendous numbers” of legal immigrants based on a “merit system,” selecting immigrants who will help grow the country’s economy.  86. Reduce the number of legal immigrants because it is “simply too large to perform adequate screening,” and these immigrants could be taking jobs away from American workers. 87. Expand the number of   visas for highly skilled workers so that more of the “talented people” who graduate from Ivy League institutions can stay in the United States and work in Silicon Valley. 88. Get rid of the   visa program because it’s “very, very bad” for American workers. 89. Continue to allow lowly paid foreign workers to come to the United States on temporary work visas to pick grapes and work in seasonal resorts. 90. Institute “extreme vetting” of all immigrants.  91. End birthright citizenship, only granting citizenship to babies whose parents are legally in the country. 92. Sunset visa laws, forcing Congress to periodically review and revise them. 93. Strongly enforce visa expiration dates. Complete the biometric   visa tracking system, which has been authorized by Congress but has yet to be completed.  94. Strengthen and expand the use of   which allows employers to check an employee’s eligibility to work. 95. Urge assimilation because “our system of government, and our American culture, is the best in the world and will produce the best outcomes for all who adopt it. ” 96. Accomplish more immigration reforms in a few months than politicians have accomplished in the past 50 years. With these reforms, Trump promises: “Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease. ” 97. Make illegal immigration a “memory of the past. ”  NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY  98. Be unpredictable and keep all military strategy a secret. “No one is going to touch us, because I’m so unpredictable. ”  99. Put “different generals” in place because “under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, I think the generals have been reduced to rubble. ” Trim military bureaucracy. 100. Find great generals  —   like the next Gen. George Patton or Gen. Douglas MacArthur  —   and do not allow them to go on television news shows to explain their military strategy. Trump prefers generals who are rough,   and beloved by their troops.  101. As soon as he takes office, ask Congress to repeal the defense sequester that limited the military’s budget.  102. Strengthen the military so that it’s “so big and so strong and so great” that “nobody’s going to mess with us. ” 103. Equip troops with the “best equipment known to mankind. ” 104. Modernize and renew the nuclear weapons arsenal.  105. Grow the Army from its current size of 470, 000   soldiers to 540, 000.  106. Modernize and grow the Navy fleet to 350 surface ships and submarines. The Navy currently has 272 deployable   ships. 107. Grow the Air Force to 1, 200 fighter aircraft.  108. Grow the Marine Corps to 36 battalions, increasing the   force from its current target of 182, 000 to 200, 000. 109. Involve all 50 states in rebuilding the military and developing new technologies. Create thousands of jobs building these new ships in Philadelphia, Portsmouth, N. H. and Hampton Roads, Va. North Carolina’s Research Triangle will also play a key role.  110. Develop a “state of the art” missile defense system and modernize naval cruisers to provide Ballistic Missile Defense capabilities. It will cost $220 million per modernization. 111. Leave troops in Afghanistan because it’s such “a mess. ”  112. Increase the U. S. military presence in the East and South China Seas.  113. Keep the military prison at Guantanamo Bay open.  114. Continue use of drone strikes but put a renewed emphasis on human intelligence in information gathering and utilize technology such as “  printing, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare. ” 115. Drop that “dirty, rotten traitor” Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane into desolate Afghanistan without a parachute. Trump has also suggested that Bergdahl be shot.  116. “I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must fight to win. ”  CYBERSECURITY  117. Assemble a “cyber review team” of the best military, civilian and private sector cybersecurity experts to comprehensively review all systems and technology, starting with the most sensitive ones. The team will also remain current on new methods of attack and set up protocols for each agency and government officials. 118. Establish a training program for government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them. Punish those who violate classification rules, holding them responsible to the fullest extent of the law.  119. Solicit recommendations from the secretary of defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff for strengthening and augmenting the country’s Cyber Command.  120. Order the Department of Justice to create joint task forces to coordinate responses to cyberthreats. (The FBI already runs “cyber task forces” in each one of its 56 field offices.) 121. Develop better cyberweapons.  VETERANS AFFAIRS  122. Appoint a Department of Veterans Affairs secretary whose “sole purpose will be to serve veterans. ” 123. Dramatically reform the agency. Fire “the corrupt and incompetent” leaders and make it easier for the secretary to fire people. Trump promises to protect and promote “honest employees” who highlight wrongdoing. These employees will also receive bonuses.  124. Create a commission to investigate “all the fraud,   and wrongdoing that has taken place in the VA. ” Present these findings to Congress to spur legislative reform. 125. Create a White House hotline that is active 24 hours a day and is answered by a real person who will handle veterans’ complaints of wrongdoing at the VA and “ensure no complaints fall through the cracks. ”  126. Allow veterans to take their military identification card to any medical facility that accepts Medicaid patients to receive care. Veterans can also seek care “at a private service provider of their own choice. ” Trump promises that: “Under a Trump administration, no veteran will die waiting for service. These days are over starting January 2017. ” 127. Embed satellite VA clinics in rural hospitals and underserved areas, and ensure that every VA hospital is permanently staffed with obstetrics and gynecology doctors.  128. Increase funding for the treatment of   stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries and mental health issues. Increase the number of mental health professionals.  129. Ensure that undocumented immigrants do not receive better health services than veterans.  130. Veterans who apply for a job at a VA facility will have five points added to their qualifying scores. For all jobs across the country, employers should consider veterans ahead of immigrants.  131. Invest more heavily in programs that help military veterans transition back to civilian life, including job training and placement services.  132. “Ensure our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting backlogs. No more excessive red tape. ”  FOREIGN POLICY  133. “A Trump administration will never ever put the interest of a foreign country before the interest of our country. From now on, it’s going to be America first. ” 134. Force other NATO countries to pay for more of their defense, and only come to the aid of other countries if those nations have “fulfilled their obligations to us. ” In particular, Trump expects Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the security the United States provides.  135. Call a summit with NATO allies and a separate summit with Asian allies to discuss “a rebalancing of financial commitments” and adopting new strategies, such as upgrading “NATO’s outdated mission and structure. ” 136. Get along with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship. ” Trump would also look into lifting the sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea. 137. Communicate with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un about his nuclear program, which would mark a major shift in U. S. policy toward the isolated nation. “I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him. ” 138. Stay out of the Syrian civil war. Although Trump considers Syrian President Bashar   “bad,” he has said the United States has higher priorities. Around the world, Trump has said, he prefers stability over regime changes. 139. Reverse Obama’s executive orders and “concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored. ” Trump has pledged to “demand political and religious freedom for the people of Cuba. ” 140. “Stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free. ” 141. Help Haiti and its “incredible people” rebuild their country.  142. Be a “true friend to Israel. ” Trump says the United States will “be working with Israel very closely, very, very closely. ” 143. Do not throw a lavish state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping, as Obama did last year, and instead buy Jinping a “  Big Mac” and tell him “we gotta get down to work. ” 144. If not properly welcomed into a foreign country, turn around and leave.  145. “It is time to shake the rust off of America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold. ” Trump wants to “establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. ”  IRAN  146. Tear up the Iran deal and then “totally” renegotiate the whole thing.  147. Negotiate the release of all U. S. prisoners held in Iran before taking office. (Five Americans were released during the campaign, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian; Trump has claimed some credit for this.) 148. Refuse to call Iran’s leader by his preferred title. “I’ll say, ‘Hey baby, how ya doing?’ I will never call him the supreme leader. ” 149. “Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon and, under a Trump administration, will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. ”  CHINA  150. “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what they’re doing. ”  151. Direct the secretary of the treasury to label China a currency manipulator.  152. Instruct the U. S. trade representative to bring trade cases against China, both here and at the World Trade Organization. If necessary, apply tariffs against China consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.  153. Adopt a “zero tolerance policy” for Chinese hackers and those who steal American intellectual property and ideas.  154. Crack down on China’s “lax labor and environmental standards. ”    FIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE  155. Immediately ask the generals to present a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy the Islamic State. 156. Frequently use the term “radical Islamic terrorism. ” 157. Call an international conference focused on how to halt the spread of the “hateful ideology of Radical Islam. ”  158. Allow Russia to deal with the Islamic State in Syria   work with Putin to wipe out shared enemies.  159. Work with allies to cut off funding to the Islamic State, expand intelligence sharing and use cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting. Work closely with NATO and “our Arab allies and friends in the Middle East. ” Partner with Israel, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah   and “all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished. ” 160. “Bomb the     out of ISIS” and “knock them out. ” Also bomb oil fields controlled by the Islamic State, then seize the oil and give the profits to military veterans who were wounded while fighting.  161. Target and kill the relatives of suspected terrorists, a violation of international law.  162. Shut down parts of the Internet so that Islamic State terrorists cannot use it to recruit American children. 163. Bring back waterboarding, which is widely considered torture, and use interrogation techniques that are “a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. ” Even if such tactics don’t work, Trump says, suspected terrorists “deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing. ” (Trump suggested after the election, however, that he was reconsidering his position because of a conversation with a general who opposed the tactic.) 164. Establish a Commission on Radical Islam that will include “reformist voices in the Muslim community” and will identify the warning signs of radicalization, educate the American public and develop protocol for police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners. 165. Temporarily ban most foreign Muslims from entering the United States “until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. ” Trump would allow exceptions for dignitaries, business people, athletes and others who have “proven” themselves. Although Trump’s aides, surrogates and running mate insist he no longer wants this   Muslim ban, Trump himself has yet to fully disavow the idea and it is still posted on his campaign website. 166. Temporarily suspend “immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism. ” Order the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to develop a list of regions and countries to include. The list will likely include Syria and Libya.  167. Create an ideological screening test for all immigration applicants with the goal of keeping “radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. ” For example, immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan would be asked for their views on honor killings and sharia law, along with their opinions of women, gays and minorities. 168. Heavily surveil mosques in the United States. Trump has said he would “strongly consider” closing some mosques.  169. Encourage Muslim communities to “cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad  —   and they do know where they are. ” 170. Deport those “who are guests in our country that are preaching hate. ” 171. Aggressively investigate and charge anyone who lends material support to terrorism. 172. “Our administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voices. This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings. ” 173. “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened. ”  REFUGEES   174. Bar Syrian refugees from entering the country and kick out any who are already living here, as they might be “the ultimate Trojan horse. ” 175. Create a database of Syrian refugees. Trump has also seemed open to the idea of creating a database of Muslims in the country, although his aides say that is not true.  176. Set up safe zones in Syria and then force wealthy Persian Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia to pick up the bill. “They’re gonna put up all the money. We’re not gonna put up money. We’re gonna lead it and we’ll do a great a job. But we’re gonna get the Gulf states to put up the money. ” 177. Do not admit any refugees without the support of the local community where they will be placed.  ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  178. Gut, if not eliminate, the Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump has called a “disgrace. ” 179. Rescind all environmental executive actions signed by Obama. 180. Eliminate “intrusive” regulations, along with “any regulation that is outdated, unnecessary, bad for workers, or contrary to the national interest. ” Eliminate duplication in regulations, deferring to local officials and residents. Remove the “draconian barriers” to allow energy infrastructure projects and development to proceed. 181. Eliminate the Clean Water Rule that defines the ”waters of the United States” and gives added protection to tributaries that impact the health of downstream waters.  182. Scrap the Clean Power Plan, which reduces the amount of carbon pollution from power plants. Trump says this could save the country $7. 2 billion per year.  183. Oppose a carbon tax on fossil fuels use that could be used to reverse damage to the environment caused by the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 184. Revoke restrictions on new drilling technologies and support “safe hydraulic fracturing” to create “millions of jobs. ” Lease more federal land for drilling, including “vast areas of our offshore energy resources. ”  185. Ease federal regulations on coal mining to revive the industry. Eliminate Obama’s moratorium on new leases for coal mined from federal lands. 186. Treat climate change like the “hoax” that Trump has said it is. (In a recent interview with the New York Times, Trump seemed to soften that position.) 187. Cancel all funding for domestic and international climate change programs, which he estimates would total $100 billion over two terms. Trump would instead spend that money on domestic infrastructure projects. 188. Pull out of the Paris Agreement, which was recently signed by 196 countries pledging to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  189. Become the world’s dominant leader in energy production. Attain “complete American energy independence” so that the United States is no longer dependent on foreign oil.  190. Lower energy prices for consumers.  191. Ask TransCanada to renew its permit application for the Keystone XL pipeline so that it can be approved.  192. “Unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. ” Create at least a half million jobs a year, prompting a more than $30 billion increase in annual wages over seven years. This will increase the GDP by more than $100 billion annually. Use the revenue from energy production to rebuild roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure.  193. Restore and protect the Florida Everglades, even though it’s a “  sight down there. ” 194. Ensure the country has “absolutely crystal clear and clean water” and “beautiful, immaculate air. ”  INFRASTRUCTURE  195. Spur the spending of $1 trillion in public and private dollars on infrastructure projects over 10 years. Invest in “transportation, clean water, a modern and reliable electricity grid, telecommunications, security infrastructure, and other pressing domestic infrastructure needs” without adding to the national debt.  196. Negotiate rates for these projects that are   of what the United States is currently paying. “Cut wasteful spending on boondoggles” by streamlining the permit and approval processes. 197. Provide tax incentives to encourage   partnerships. 198. Employ   contracting to ensure projects are on time and on budget.  199. Triple funding for revolving loan fund programs to help states and local governments upgrade drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. 200. Create “thousands of new jobs in construction, steel manufacturing, and other sectors” to carry out this work. Only “American workers” will be hired for these jobs. 201. Modernize airports and air traffic control systems. Reform the Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration to reduce wait times and hassle for travelers.  202. Look to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed the interstate highway system, for inspiration.       ETHICS REFORM   203. “Drain the swamp” in Washington and “cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past. ” 204. Propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, limiting House members to three terms, or six years, and senators to two terms, or 12 years.  205. Institute a   ban on White House and congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave office. (Trump is already having staff and Cabinet members sign pledges..  206. Institute a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. 207. Ban foreign lobbyists from raising money for American elections.  208. Appoint an attorney general who will reform the Department of Justice “like it was necessary after Watergate. ”   HILLARY CLINTON  209. “Lock her up. ” Instruct the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton’s “situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. ” Trump had said the investigation would include Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and the ways in which the Clinton Foundation raised money. (Trump told the New York Times on Tuesday this is now a lesser priority. “I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t,” he said.)  EDUCATION  210. “When I am president, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally. ” 211. Limit the influence of the Department of Education and give more control to local school districts. The department might also see a major budget cut.  212. Get rid of Common Core because it’s “a disaster” and a “very bad thing. ”  213. “Be the nation’s biggest cheerleader for school choice,” use the “pulpit of the presidency” to campaign for expanded school choice in all 50 states and support the election of local, state and federal officials who agree.  214. Allow families to redirect their share of education spending to a private, charter, magnet, religious or homeschool. Provide $20 billion in federal funding to establish block grants that states could use to help children in   families enroll at private and charter schools. 215. Support merit pay for teachers.  216. Expand vocational and technical training programs.  217. Take away federal tax breaks and other perks from colleges and universities that do not make “a good faith effort” to reduce the cost of tuition and the amount of student debt.  218. “Make   options more affordable and accessible through technology enriched delivery models. ” 219. Push universities to spend their “  endowments” on tuition, student life and student housing.  220. Cap repayment of federal student loans at 12. 5 percent of a person’s discretionary income and forgive any remaining balance after 15 years. Current   plans allow for payments of 10 to 15 percent of discretionary income, with balances forgiven after 20 to 25 years.  221. Reduce or end the government’s role in student loans.  222. Ensure that jobs are waiting for high school and college graduates.  CHILD CARE  223. Rewrite the tax code to allow parents to fully deduct   expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents. (Some of these expenses are already deductible under the law.) 224. Create Dependent Care Savings Accounts and provide matching funds for   families.  225. Add incentives for employers that offer   child care to employees. Trump has said companies can “very easily” and inexpensively do this because “you need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys. ” 226. Guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the conditions of unemployment insurance employers are required to carry.    POVERTY AND VIOLENCE  227. “Every action I take, I will ask myself: Does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?” 228. Rebuild and fix inner cities, especially Detroit. “The inner cities are unbelievably dangerous. The education is no good, the safety is horrible, and there are no jobs. And I tell everybody: ‘What the hell do you have to lose?’ I’m going to fix it. ” 229. Quickly end   violence, which Trump has repeatedly compared to war zones. “I’ll be able to make sure that when you walk down the street in your inner city, or wherever you are, you’re not gonna be shot. Your child isn’t gonna be shot. ”  230. Create “jobs and opportunities for African Americans and Hispanic Americans. ”  231. Reduce the number of people receiving welfare.  232. “And at the end of four years, I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce. ”  POLICING  233. “The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20, 2017, safety will be restored. ” On that day, Trump says, “Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. ” 234. Stop the surge of violent crime and homicides in Chicago within “one week. ” 235. “Dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our cities. . . . They are not going to be here very long, folks. They’re gonna be out of here. ” 236. Immediately stop the killing of police officers. “It’s going to stop, okay? It’s going to stop. We’re going to be law and order. It’s going to stop. ” 237. Sign an executive order calling for the death penalty for anyone found guilty of killing a police officer.  238. Provide more funding for police training.  239. Ensure that firefighters are not shot at when they are responding to a fire.  240. Expand the use of “stop and frisk,” which Trump says worked “incredibly well” in New York.  241. Encourage profiling and targeting “people that maybe look suspicious. ” 242. “The police and the law enforcement in this country  —   I will never ever let them down, just remember that. ”  SUPREME COURT  243. Pick Supreme Court justices who are “really great legal scholars,” opposed to abortion and fans of the Second Amendment. Select a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia from a list of more than 20 contenders that has already been released.   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY  244. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again. ” 245. Get rid of the Johnson Amendment, which prohibits   organizations like churches from formally endorsing or opposing political candidates.  246. Sign the First Amendment Defense Act if it passes Congress. The legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee ( ) would prevent any federal agency from denying a tax exemption, grant, contract, license or certification to an individual, association or business that discriminates against gays.  247. “We will be one people under one God. ”  ABORTION  248. Defund Planned Parenthood and reallocate its funding to community health centers. 249. Sign into law the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks, the point at which antiabortion activists say a fetus can feel pain.  250. Make the Hyde Amendment permanent. Since 1976, Congress has annually passed the Hyde Amendment, banning the use of federal dollars  —   in particular, Medicaid funds  —   for abortion, except in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s life.  GUNS  251. On the first day in office, get rid of   zones at military bases, recruiting centers and, in some cases, schools. These zones are like “target practice for the sickos and for the mentally ill. ” 252. Use “common sense” to fix the mental health system to prevent mass shootings. Expand treatment programs and reform laws to make it easier to take preventive action. 253. Rescind Obama’s executive actions related to gun control.  254. Arm more of the “good guys” who can reduce the severity of mass shootings. Get rid of bans on certain types of guns and magazines so that “good, honest people” can own the guns of their choice. 255. Fix the background check system used when purchasing guns to ensure states are properly uploading criminal and health records.  256. Allow   permits to be recognized in all 50 states. 257. Impose a minimum sentence of five years in federal prison for any violent felon who commits a crime using a gun, with no chance for parole or early release.  258. Expand programs like Project Exile, a federal program started in Virginia in 1997 that locked up criminals possessing illegal guns for years in federal prisons far from their homes.  259. “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon. Period. ”  MEDIA  260. “Open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. ” 261. Oppose the killing of journalists. “I hate some of these people, but I would never kill them. ”  262. Stop AT&T from buying Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. Federal antitrust regulators would have to review and approve that type of merger. 263. “It’s time to reject the political and media elite that’s bled our country dry. ”  OTHER  264. Fix the rigged system.  265. Sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct or assault. “All of these liars will be sued after the election is over. ” 266. Sue the New York Times for publishing accusations from women who say Trump groped them.  267. Reopen Trump University. (Earlier this month, Trump paid $25 million to settle a fraud case against the now defunct business.) 268. Ensure that Iowa continues to host the nation’s first presidential nominating contest. 269. Boost American agriculture by lessening environmental regulations and ensuring family farms aren’t double taxed. 270. Push federal regulators to increase the amount of ethanol blended into the nation’s gasoline supply. 271. “I will take care of women, and I have great respect for women. I do cherish women, and I will take care of women. ”  272. Change the new name of North America’s tallest mountain back to Mount McKinley.  273. Provide more funding for drug treatment, especially for heroin addicts. “We are going to work very hard with medical professionals to take care of those people that are so badly addicted. ” 274. Fully protect Social Security benefits.  OVERARCHING PROMISES  275. “The whole psyche [of the United States] will change” on Election Day.  276. “Whether you vote for me or not, I’m with you. I will never ever let you down. ” 277. “I will give you everything. ” 278. “I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected. America will be a tolerant and open society. ” 279. Be a cheerleader for America and bring the country’s spirit back. “Bring us all together as Americans. We’re living in a divided nation. We’re living in a very divided nation. We’re going to be brought together. ” 280. Bring back the American Dream. “Take the brand of the United States and make it great again. ” 281. “We will start winning again and winning like you’ve never seen before. ” 282. “Together we will make American wealthy and prosperous again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. ”  "
"         A solemn President Trump turned his Thursday afternoon announcement of a new labor secretary nominee into a screed against the media and   defense of his first four weeks as president. It was remarkable. Trump hit all the usual points: the polls, the electoral college, the media, etc. He even said that he inherited a “mess” four separate times. There were grievances galore. Below is the transcript, which we’ll update as it comes in, along with our analysis and annotations.  TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student; former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed; did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be  —   I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of Labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved, weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, “never Trump. ” And Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible; just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility. I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact  —   because the people get it  —   much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  —   to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, “Oh, that’s good. ” Now it means, “That’s good for jobs. ” Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league  —   Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit  —   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s okay, too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it, to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking  —   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure; we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort  —   not all the time  —   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say  —   they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not a  —   the distortion  —   and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across the government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country; you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea  —   we’ll take care of it folks; we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward toward stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary [James] Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS [another name for the Islamic State] a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer  —   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who has totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great support from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my  —   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it; I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted  —   it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in search of war, we really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another, after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230 is impossible. 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never [done] before, so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. And  —   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday and I heard  —   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved. And they’re outstanding people like Sen. Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved [for director of National Intelligence]. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague  —   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen. So, if the Democrats who have  —   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. I’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks  —   in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have    deals, bilateral. We’re going to have    deals. We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process  —   they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes they have, and you say “let me see your regulations,” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental  —   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation  —   take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general  —   now [Homeland Security] Secretary [John] Kelly yesterday, and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke. We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts [that] are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit [court] that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is  —   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn’t say that. And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I’ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It it’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league. I’ve also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at [Secretary of State] Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that [they] probably were never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  —   decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p. m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions. Mara, Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong  —   what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  —   that they know nothing about it; they weren’t in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia; they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal  —   I think it’s very important  —   the illegal, giving out classified information. It was  —   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s  —   I spoke to the president of Mexico; I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying  —   the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, “I don’t think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right. ” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, “Huh, that’s fine. ” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to  —   he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He’s doing the job. You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes? QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was  —   it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really  —   I mean, they were such a minor part. They  —   I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person  —   I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room, and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. [Paul] Manafort, who’s  —   by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody  —   people knew that. Everybody knew that. So, these people  —   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories. So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President [Vladimir] Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the countries. So that’s the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia  —   this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo has  —   has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one, and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times’ story, yesterday. And it talked about  —   these are front page. So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal top, and they just wrote the story that is not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in the New York Times, put it on front page? That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that. And it was totally  —   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things. Okay, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more, or 350 electoral votes. President Obama about 365 ( ). (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   …     I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given, we had a very, very big margin. QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )? TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given  —   I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? Okay, thank you, that’s   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, sir, yes? QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did  —   whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the [Russian] Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What  —   what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, sir, you said on a couple of occasions this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks. TRUMP: We are. QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a  —   a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that? TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position, so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man, and he’s offered his services, and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we will need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me, and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think. It was really, what happened after that, but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time, and I started to think about it, I said “well I don’t see”    to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by  —   who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said “doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. ” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as  —   as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs, and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So  —   and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks  —   on the leaks, sir   …     TRUMP:   …     Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you. QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today   …     TRUMP:   …     Yes, we’re looking at them very  —   very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re  —   I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies  —   I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved. In Justice, as an example. So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was  —   honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said ’you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen,’ but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world, and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said “that’s terrible that it was leaked,” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself “what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?” What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very  —   you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that, too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public, and in a way that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into The Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times, and I’m saying ’what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?’ We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it, and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do  —   and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for  —   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters. It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes, and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that. But I’m not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good  —   he’s saying no. It’s okay, Jim. It’s okay, Jim, you’ll have your chance. But I watch others, too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be  —   I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually  —   I think that’d actually be better. People  —   I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter, is that one, right? Because you know I think they have lower  —   I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it  —   again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true, but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy, and everybody’s good. And sometimes  —   I mean, I know President [Barack] Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s okay. That’s fine. But I think it would  —   I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff  —   what was said at an office about Hillary [Clinton] cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine  —   seriously  —   can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. Okay, he should be put in the electric  —   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay. Maybe not you, John. Yes? We’ll do you next, Jim, I do you next. QUESTION: ( ) clarify  —   TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   prior to your  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   inauguration. TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION: And then fired him  —   TRUMP: Excuse me. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way  —   and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job, and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. Okay? Jim? QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you. TRUMP: Okay. QUESTION: So, pass that along  —   TRUMP: Ask  —   ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. Okay? QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir  —   TRUMP: Well, that’s  —   well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually. TRUMP: Okay, go ahead, John. QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time  —   TRUMP: I was okay with it. QUESTION:    you said  —   you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign news conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000 emails. I’m wondering, sir, if you  —   TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that. QUESTION: Then   …     your   …     numbers   …     were off, too. TRUMP: No  —   no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that. QUESTION: If  —   if I may ask you, sir, it  —   it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during the campaign  —   TRUMP: Okay, fair question. Ready? QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that  —   TRUMP: No  —   no, but let me do one at a time. QUESTION: If I may as a follow up? TRUMP: Do you mind? QUESTION: Yes, sir. TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me, and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast, your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified  —   regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong  —   at my suggestion  —   and I give Reince [Preibus] great credit for this  —   at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us, and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so  —   they were  —   when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate, and she  —   and she should have reported herself. Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job. ” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t  —   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone. ” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such  —   I do get good ratings, you have to admit that  —   the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very  —   not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look  —   the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes  —   sometimes somebody gets   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know. I  —   I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s  —   it’s brutal. Now, they’ll take this news conference  —   I’m actually having a very good time, okay? But they’ll take this news conference  —   don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. Okay? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, “Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. ” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves. ” I’m not ranting and raving. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I may, just one more     …     TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have  —   let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. We’ll   …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir   …     TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though. QUESTION: Doesn’t that under   …     TRUMP: Very fake news. QUESTION:   …     I know, but aren’t you   …     (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news. TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new   …     QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary [Alex] Acosta, I must say. TRUMP: I looked  —   you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir. TRUMP: Okay. Now I checked it  —   I said  —   they said, “No, sir. ” I said, “Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. ” QUESTION: But aren’t you  —   aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like. TRUMP: I do that. QUESTION: When you call it “fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important. TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. Okay. I understand what you’re  —   and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, “Wow, that’s going to be a great story. ” And I’ll get killed. I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive  —   sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay. They’ll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press  —   the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go  —   as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running  —   this is a   machine, and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press. You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying “here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some  —   all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know  —   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said “you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. ” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on health care, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff or somebody, you know  —   you know, whatever reason. But  —   and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible)   …     for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second   …     TRUMP:   …     I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public  —   that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now tomorrow, you’ll say “Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. ” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton  —   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said “I know politically it’s probably not good for me. ” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say “oh, it’s so great. ” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can  —   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But  —   but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said ’you know.’ He’s sitting behind his desk, and he’s saying ’you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story.’ Okay? And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia  —   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line? QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you   …     TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform. Yes? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States. TRUMP: Okay. QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel  —   the spy vessel off the coast of the United States. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign   …     TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ’Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States; there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.’ Because the  —   you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ’Oh, isn’t that wonderful.’ But I know you well enough. Then you would say, ’Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn’t have done that.’ Look, all of the   …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people. Go ahead. QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I’ve already   …     QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal. Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough  —   the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along  —   and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are   …     TRUMP: Who did I say is not good? QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened. QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine   …     TRUMP: They all happened recently. No   …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     this country’s ability to work with Russia? TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay? But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. QUESTION: Can we   …     TRUMP: I gave  —   you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. ’We are going to attack Mosul in four months.’ Then three months later, ’We are going to attack Mosul in one month.’ ’Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.’ In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ’Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.’ I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you. Okay. QUESTION: Could I just ask you  —   thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble   …     TRUMP: Where are you from? QUESTION: BBC. TRUMP: Here’s another beauty. QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. TRUMP: Yeah. Sure. QUESTION: Mr. President   …     TRUMP: Just like CNN right? QUESTION: On the travel ban  —   we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government   …     TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government   …     QUESTION: Were there any mistakes   …     TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot. We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision. That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there. So Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said ’wow, never thought of it.’ I said ’how about one week?’ He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in. Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly. Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country. Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed. QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce   …     TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been. QUESTION: During the election? TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody   …     QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course. TRUMP: Look, look, look   …     QUESTION:   …     of the election? TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question? QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that  —   whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he  —   now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. QUESTION: Mr. President   …     TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks? QUESTION: Mr. President   …     TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that okay? Five? QUESTION: Mr. President, on national   …     TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s  —   I want to find a friendly reporter. QUESTION: Mr.   …     TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. QUESTION: ( )   …     TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the  —   anyone on your staff of being ( ). Because ( ). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you’re general forecast like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything   …     happens through their packs   …     is one of the ( )   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   …     he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, it’s not, not  —   not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down, I understand the rest of your question. So here’s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least   Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican  —   quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about  —   he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the [Israeli] prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it. So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa   …     from the   …     (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific   …     TRUMP: It’s a very fair question. QUESTION:   …     countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration. TRUMP: Right. QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it? TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA, and they’re gang members, and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way  —   it’s a very  —   it’s a very, very tough subject. We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget, and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is  —   is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do, and you know, the law is rough. I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision. But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay? QUESTION: Mr. President   …     (CROSSTALK) QUESTION:   …     reopening of the White House Visitors Office? TRUMP: Yes. QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean   …     TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very  —   who are you with? QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Sen. [Marco] Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets  —   she gets so unfairly  —   Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say  —   I’ve known her for a long time  —   the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money. They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it; both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school  —   because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  —   she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Okay, thank you, that’s a very nice question. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s okay. QUESTION: It doesn’t have to be a bad question. TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re  —   TRUMP: Fix the inner cities. QUESTION:    president. Fixing the inner cities. TRUMP: Yep. QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it? TRUMP: That was very professional and very good. QUESTION: I’m very professional. TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible  —   you know, it takes a long time. It’s taken more than a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people  —   and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it  —   in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and  —   and it’s a  —   it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and they are living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all  —   and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. Okay? QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going  —   are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your  —   your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as  —   TRUMP: Am I going to include who? QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  —   TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION:  —   Hispanic Caucus  —   TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION: No  —   no  —   no. I’m not  —   TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? QUESTION: I’m just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then, set up the meeting. QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now. TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman [Elijah] Cummings, and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy. QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told  —   he was probably told “don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics. ” And that’s part of the problem in this country. Okay, one more. QUESTION: (inaudible) TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. QUESTION: (inaudible)   …     not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you   …     TRUMP:   …     And some of it  —   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs, and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead. QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it? TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that? QUESTION: What are you going to do about  —   what are you going to do about (inaudible). TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very  —   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided  —   I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on  —   you know, we’re going to stop  —   we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime. We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me  —   but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try  —   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks.              Caption   The new president’s tumultuous first weeks have been marked by a controversial executive orders and conflicts with the media.  Feb. 16, 2017 President Trump speaks during a news conference in the East Room of the White House. Jabin   Washington Post  "
"         President Trump on Friday addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, the event where he launched his political star in 2011. From the outset, he had one thing on his mind: the media. Trump began his speech with a lengthy tirade against the press. We have annotated the president’s remarks, using Genius. To see an annotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text. To add your own, sign up for a Genius account.  TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. So great to be with you. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) Great to be back at CPAC. It’s a place I have really. .. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! TRUMP: I love this place. (APPLAUSE) Love you people. So thank you    thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife, and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters and so great. When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance. So I want to thank Matt and Mercedes. (APPLAUSE) And when Matt called and asked I said, ”Absolutely I’ll be there with you.” I mean, the real reason I said it, I didn’t want him to go against me cause that. .. (LAUGHTER) . .. that one you can’t beat. So I said absolutely. And it really is an honor to be here. I wouldn’t miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends. (APPLAUSE) And we’ll see you again next year and the year after that and I’ll be doing this. .. (APPLAUSE) . .. I’ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can and I’ll make sure that we’re here a lot. AUDIENCE MEMBER: You can do it! TRUMP: You know if you remember my first major speech    sit down everybody. C’mon. (LAUGHTER) You know the dishonest media they’ll say, ”He didn’t get a standing ovation.” You know why? (LAUGHTER) No    you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they will say, ”He never got a standing ovation,” right? (Inaudible). They are the worst. (APPLAUSE) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: So    sit down. (LAUGHTER) ”Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.” (LAUGHTER) They leave out the part, ”They never sat down.” They leave that out. So I just want to thank    but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and    probably five or six years ago. First major political speech. And you were there. And it was    I loved it. I loved the people. I loved the commotion. And then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn’t even running, right? (LAUGHTER) But it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country. And I said, ”Let’s go to it.” So, it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. I’ll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, ”I think I like this business.” (LAUGHTER) I would’ve come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial. We wanted border security. We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we’re going to get. .. (APPLAUSE) . .. and people consider that controversial but you didn’t consider it controversial. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So, I’ve been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years we’ve been together. And now you finally have a president, finally. Took you a long time. (APPLAUSE) Took you a long time. (APPLAUSE) And it’s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me. Believe me. You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make America great again. (APPLAUSE) The media didn’t think we would win. The. .. AUDIENCE MEMBER: ( ) (LAUGHER) TRUMP: . .. pundits    you’re right. They had an idea. The pundits didn’t think we’d win. The consultants that suck up all that money    oh, they suck it up. They’re so good. (LAUGHTER) They’re not good at politics, but they’re really good at sucking up people’s money. Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum. But the consultants didn’t think we would win. But they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them. .. (APPLAUSE) . .. totally wrong. Never    and    and this is so true. And this is what’s been happening. Never underestimate the people. Never. (APPLAUSE) I don’t think it’ll ever happen again. And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phony, fake. (APPLAUSE) A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people. (APPLAUSE) Because they have no sources, they just make ’em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, ”Nine people have confirmed.” There’re no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said, ”Give me a break.” Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people. But they say ”nine people.” And somebody reads it and they think, ”Oh, nine people. They have nine sources.” They make up sources. They’re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word ”fake.” And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy. They take the word ”fake” out. And now I’m saying, ”Oh no, this is no good.” But that’s the way they are. So I’m not against the media, I’m not against the press. I don’t mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don’t go. .. (LAUGHTER) I don’t get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. (APPLAUSE) ”A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.” Let ’em say it to my face. (APPLAUSE) Let there be no more sources. And remember this    and in not    in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around. They’re talented, they’re honest as the day is long. They’re great. But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people. And they shouldn’t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you’ve never seen before. So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story    and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you’re not part of the story. And if you’re not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know    if you are part of the story, you know what they’re saying is true or not. TRUMP: So when they make it up    and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls. The polls. They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised. Actually, a couple polls got it right. I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job. (APPLAUSE) And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out. And I say, what network is it? And they’ll say, a certain    let’s not even mention names, right? Shall we? (APPLAUSE) Well, you have a lot of them. Look, the Clinton News Network is one. (APPLAUSE) Totally. Take a look. Honestly. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at polls over the last two years. Now you’d think they would fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered, but I    who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they’re not legit, but it’s one or the other, look at how inaccurate    look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls. They’re so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative. It creates like this narrative that is just like we’re not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I’m not feeling great today, he can’t win, so I won’t go and vote. I won’t go and vote. It creates a whole false deal. And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it. They’re very smart, they’re very cunning and they’re very dishonest. So just to conclude, I mean, it’s a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can’t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment. (LAUGHTER) And I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me. Nobody. (APPLAUSE) I mean, who use its more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us    it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly. (APPLAUSE) And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it’s not your agenda and it’s not the country’s agenda, it’s their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn’t tell the truth. Doesn’t tell the truth. So just in finishing, I say it doesn’t represent the people, it doesn’t tell the never will represent the people, and we’re going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. (APPLAUSE) I’m here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory. .. (APPLAUSE) . .. was a victory and the win for conservative values. (APPLAUSE) And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it’s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag. (APPLAUSE) Yeah, there we should stand up. Come on. There we should stand up. OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here    this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won’t read about it, OK. (LAUGHTER) But there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And you’re going to see it more and more. (APPLAUSE) So we’re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. There’s never been anything like this. There’s been some movements, but there’s never been anything like this. There’s been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out. (LAUGHTER) But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen? Not that I’m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why? Because he’s right on one issue; trade. He was right about trade. Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support. So actually, I like Bernie. OK? I like Bernie. (APPLAUSE) But I’m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America. First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first. (APPLAUSE) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: For too long, we’ve traded away our jobs to other countries. So terrible. We’ve defended other nations’ borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in. We’re going to build a wall, don’t worry about it. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. In fact, it’s going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule. (APPLAUSE) Way, way, way ahead of schedule. It’s going to start very soon. General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job he’s done. (APPLAUSE) And remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. We’re getting the bad ones out, OK? We’re getting the bad    if you watch these people, it’s like gee, that’s so sad. We’re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn’t be whether it’s drugs or murder or other things. We’re getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one. Basically all I’ve done is keep my promise. (APPLAUSE) We’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East, we’ve spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it. (BOOING) And by the way, the Middle East is in    I mean, it’s not even close, it’s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you. (APPLAUSE) Be a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. This is the situation that I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me. We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. Now, I’ve been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn’t work, folks. I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn’t work. And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you’re watching, they’re not you. They’re largely    many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election. It’s like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election. But I always say, Obamacare doesn’t work. And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare. TRUMP: And the bottom line, we’re changing it. We’re going to make it much better, we’re going to make it less expensive. We’re going to make it much better. Obamacare covers very few people    and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them    it was taken away from them. (APPLAUSE) Millions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie, 28 times. You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan. Over and over and over again, you heard it. So we’re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (APPLAUSE) And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we’re working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy. (APPLAUSE) But I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely, it’s already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, it’s a disaster. But two years, don’t do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they’ll beg and it’s their problem. But it’s not the right thing to do for the American people, it’s not the right thing to do. (APPLAUSE) We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it’s doubled. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We don’t win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Do we win anything? Do we win anything? We’re going to win. We’re going to win big, folks. We’re going to start winning again, believe me. We’re going to win. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: But we’re taking a firm, bold and decisive measure, we have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over, it’s over. (APPLAUSE) Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that we’re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again. We’ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall. (APPLAUSE) By doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this    our border patrol, I’ll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to. (LAUGHTER) But they were disgusted with what they saw and we’ll stop it. We’ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. Pouring in. Pouring in. (APPLAUSE) We get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems, they get the cash. No good. No good. Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars (ph) and that’s so important because the tax    the dollars we’re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities. (APPLAUSE) We are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And we will not let them back in. They’re not coming back in, folks. They do, they’re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of. (APPLAUSE) I’m also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what’s happening in Chicago as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed. Seven people, seven people, Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, and thank them. I’ve also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the   Partnership. (APPLAUSE) So that we can protect our economic freedom. And we’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they’ll come back and we’ll make a better deal. None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster. Just take a look    by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development. It’s economy   as far as our country is concerned. We’re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We’re going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines. (APPLAUSE) And issued a new rule    this took place while I was getting ready to sign. I said who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well sir, it comes from all over the world, isn’t that wonderful? I said nope, comes from the United States, or we’re not building it. (APPLAUSE) American steel. (APPLAUSE) If they want a pipeline in the United States, they’re going to use pipe that’s made in the United States. Do we agree? (APPLAUSE) But can you imagine    I told this story the other day    can you imagine the gentleman    never met him, don’t even know the name of this company. I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice. They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn’t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before. But with the Keystone    so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants    you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don’t worry, I’ve used them all my life, OK? Don’t worry, we’re going to get it approved, I’m connected, I’m a lobbyist, don’t worry. Bottom line, Obama didn’t sign it, right? Could be 42, 000 jobs, somewhere around there    a lot of jobs. Didn’t sign it. But can you imagine, he gave up. A year ago, it was dead, now he’s doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I’m a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved. (APPLAUSE) Now, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they’re now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right? Because that’s the way the system works, a little bit off, but that’s the way the system works. We’re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas and beautiful clean coal and we’re going to put our miners back to work. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they’re going back to work. We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing. (APPLAUSE) And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can’t hire. We’re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. (APPLAUSE) And by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don’t need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us   overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don’t need. But we’re going to have regulation. It’s going to be really strong and really good and we’re going to protect our environment and we’re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, OK? (APPLAUSE) Another major promise is tax reform. We’re going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. (APPLAUSE) In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country, you see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other   they say   elect.   is meeting with Ford, he’s meeting with Chrysler, he’s meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time. (LAUGHTER) Because Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they’re going back to Michigan and they’re going back to Ohio and they’re going back to Pennsylvania and they’re going back to North Carolina and to Florida. (APPLAUSE) It’s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work, you’re going to love it, you’re going to love it, you’re going to love it. (APPLAUSE) We’re also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military. (APPLAUSE) And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we’ll never have to use it, but nobody’s gonna mess with us, folks, nobody. (APPLAUSE) It will be one of the greatest military   in American history. No one will dare question as they have been because we’re very depleted, very, very depleted. Sequester. Sequester. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength and that’s what we will have. (APPLAUSE) As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. (APPLAUSE) At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security; foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. (APPLAUSE) By the way, take a look at what’s happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what’s happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. (LAUGHTER) And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what’s going on? And it turned out that they didn’t    not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden. But they understand. The people over there understand I’m right. Take a look at what’s happening in Sweden. Take a look at what’s happening in Germany. Take a look at what’s happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris. I have a friend, he’s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn’t seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how’s Paris doing? ”Paris? I don’t go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris.” That was four years    four or five years hasn’t gone there. He wouldn’t miss it for anything. Now he doesn’t even think in terms of going there. Take a look at what’s happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can’t let it happen to us. (APPLAUSE) So let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. (APPLAUSE) We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking   action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action. I will never ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people, I won’t do it. (APPLAUSE) If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it’s OK, doesn’t bother me. The security of our people is number one, is number one. (APPLAUSE) Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don’t have my Cabinet approved, nobody mentions that. (BOOING) You know, I still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they’re gonna be approved. It’s just a delay, delay, delay, it’s really sad, it’s really sad. And these are great people, these are some great people. We still don’t have our Cabinet. I assume we’re setting records for that. That’s the only thing good about it is we’re setting records. I love setting records. (APPLAUSE) But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, Democrats, please approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you don’t mind. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) But we’re taking meetings everyday with top leaders in business, in science and industry. Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office; Caterpillar, Tractor (ph) Campbell’s Soup. We had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell’s Soup. (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) We had everybody and we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of those folks that are in that room are gonna be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs. And you know what? They’re gonna be building them in this country, not in some other country. (APPLAUSE) We’re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we’re meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed. They were closed, folks. You don’t realize that, they were closed. TRUMP: They’re now wide open and they’re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. (APPLAUSE) And when they come into the White House, we’re translating these meetings into action. One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one, a lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag. (APPLAUSE) We will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. We’re taking care of our veterans. (APPLAUSE) We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good. None of them. You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. Where did they come from? Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest. They’re not as stupid as you think. (LAUGHTER) We will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. So true. (APPLAUSE) And by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment. (APPLAUSE) You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA and they didn’t have that on the list. It’s lucky I thought about it. (LAUGHTER) But we will indeed, and they’re great people. And by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country. (APPLAUSE) The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote, and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from? What’s going on here? These are   great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They’re not deplorable. (BOOING) AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! TRUMP: Who would have thought that a word was gonna play (ph) so badly? (LAUGHTER) That’s the problem in politics. One wrong word and it’s over. She also said irredeemable, but we won’t mention that. (LAUGHTER) The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker. (APPLAUSE) You know, we haven’t been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running in the primaries. Millions and millions of people were joining. Now, I won’t say it was because of me, but it was. OK? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it and it’s gonna see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me, a lot sooner than you think. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We will not answer to donors or lobbyists, or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me. (APPLAUSE) Global cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good, it’s very important. But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I’m representing. (APPLAUSE) I’m not representing the globe, I’m representing your country. (APPLAUSE) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! TRUMP: There’s one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America, it’s the allegiance to America. (APPLAUSE) No matter our background or income, or geography, we’re all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color or the blood    the color of the blood we bleed, it’s the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember, great patriots. (APPLAUSE) We all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal    totally equal in the eyes of almighty God, we’re equal. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. (APPLAUSE) And I want to thank, by the way, the Evangelical community, the Christian community. (APPLAUSE) Communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers, because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentage of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks, that was amazing    an amazing outpour. .. (APPLAUSE) . .. and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great, we are Americans and the future belongs to us. (APPLAUSE) The future belongs to all of you. And America is coming about, and it’s coming back, and it’s roaring and you can hear it. It’s going to be bigger and better. It is going to be    it is going to be    remember and it’s roaring. It’s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. (APPLAUSE) I want to thank you. And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have. I see them; they’re all over the place. You are really great people. I want to thank you. (APPLAUSE) And I want to say to you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, folks. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)"
"         Below is the full transcript from the House Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 U. S. election.    [Justice Dept. has no information that supports Trump’s tweets alleging he was wiretapped by Obama, says Comey]   NUNES: The committee will come to order. I would like to welcome our witnesses, director of the FBI, Jim Comey and director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Rogers. Thank you both for being here today. Before we begin, I would like to remind our members and witnesses that this is an open hearing. I recognize the challenge of discussing sensitive national security issues in public. However, as part of this committee’s investigation into Russian active measures during the 2016 election, it is critical to ensure that the public has access to credible unclassified facts and to clear the air regarding unsubstantiated media reports. To our guests in the audience, welcome. We appreciate you being here. I also expect that the proper decorum will be observed at all times today and that disruptions during today’s proceedings will not be tolerated. I now recognize myself for five minutes for the purpose of an opening statement. The Putin regime has a long history of aggressive actions against other countries, including the outright invasion of two of its neighbors in recent years, as well as its brutal military action in Syria to defend the Assad regime. But it’s hostile acts take many forms, aside from direct military assaults. For example, the Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in   conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda (ph). Russia also has a long history of meddling in other countries, election systems and launching cyber attacks on a wide range of countries and industries. The Baltic’s and other Russian neighbors have long decried these attacks. But their warnings went unheeded in far too many nations’ capitals, including our own. The fact that the Russia  —   that Russia hacked U. S.   databases comes as no shock to this committee. We have been closely monitoring Russia’s aggression for years. A year ago, I publicly stated that our inability to predict Putin’s regime plans and intentions has been the biggest intelligence failure that we have seen since   and that remains my view today. However, while the indications of Russian measures targeting the U. S. presidential election are deeply troubling, one benefit is already clear. It has focused wide attention on the  —   on the pressing threats posed by the Russian autocrat. In recent years, committee members have issued repeated and forceful pleas for stronger action against Russian belligerents. But the Obama administration was committed to the notion against all evidence that we could reset relations with Putin. And it routinely ignored our warnings. I hope today’s hearing will shed light on three important focus points of the committee’s investigation on Russia active measures. First, what actions did Russia undertake against the United States during the 2016 election campaign and did anyone from political campaign  —   a political campaign conspire in these activities? Number two, were the communications of officials or associates of any campaign subject to any kind of improper surveillance? The intelligence community has  —   has extremely strict procedures for handling information pertaining to any U. S. citizens who are subject even to incidental surveillance. And this committee wants to ensure all surveillance activities have followed all relevant laws, rules and regulations. Let me be clear, I’ve been saying this for several weeks. We know there was not a physical wiretap of Trump Tower. However, it’s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President’s Trump and his associates. Number three, who has leak classified information? Numerous current and former officials have leak purportedly classified information in connection to these questions. We aim to determine who has leaked or facilitated leaks of classified information so that these individuals can be brought to justice. I hope that this committee’s bipartisan investigation will result in a definitive report on the Russian actions taken during the election campaign. To that end, we encourage anyone who has information about these topics to come forward and speak to the House Intelligence Committee. I again think the witnesses for helping shed light on these issues. And I will let recognize Ranking Member Schiff. He’s asked for 15 minutes for his opening statement, so I will go ahead and give him 15 minutes for his opening statement. Mr. Schiff? SCHIFF: Mr. Chairman, I thank you. And I also want to thank Director Comey and Admiral Rogers for appearing before us today as the committee holds its first open hearing into the interference campaign waged against our 2016 presidential election. Last summer at the height of a bitterly contested and hugely consequential presidential campaign, a foreign adversarial power intervened in an effort to weaken our democracy and to influence the outcome for one candidate and against the other. That foreign adversary was of course Russia and it activated through its intelligence agencies and upon the direct instructions of its autocratic ruler Vladimir Putin, in order to help Donald J. Trump become the 45th president of the United States. The Russian active measures campaign may have begun as early as 2015, when Russian intelligence services launched a series of spear fishing attacks designed to penetrate the computers of a broad array of Washington based Democratic and Republican party organizations, think tanks and other entities. This continued at least through the winter of 2016. While at first the hacking may have been intended solely for the collection of foreign intelligence. In   the Russians weapon eyes the stolen data and used platforms established by the Intel services, such as D. C. leaks in existing   channels like WikiLeaks to dump the documents. The stolen documents were almost uniformly damaging to the candidate Putin despised, Hillary Clinton. And by forcing her campaign to constantly respond to the daily drip of disclosures, the releases greatly benefited Donald Trump’s campaign. None of these facts is seriously in question. And they’re reflected in the consensus conclusion of our intelligence agencies. We will never know whether the Russian intervention was determinative in such a close election. Indeed, it is unknowable in a campaign to which so many small changes could have dictated a different result. More importantly, and for the purposes of our investigation, it simply does not matter. What does matter is this, the Russians successfully meddled in our democracy and our intelligence agencies have concluded they will do so again. Ours is not the first democracy to be attacked by the Russians in this way. Russian intelligence has been simile interfering in the internal and political affairs of our European and other allies for decades. SCHIFF: What is striking here is the degree to which the Russians were willing to undertake such an audacious and risky action against the most powerful nation on Earth. That ought to be a warning to us that if we thought that the Russians would not dare to so blatantly interfere in our affairs, we were wrong. And if we do not do our very best to understand how the Russians accomplished this unprecedented attack on our democracy and what we need to do to protect ourselves in the future, we will only have ourselves to blame. We know a lot about the Russian operation, about the way they amplified the damage their hacking and dumping of stolen documents was causing through the use of slick propaganda like R. T. the Kremlin’s media arm. But there is a lot we don’t know. Most important, we do not yet know whether the Russians have the help of U. S. citizens including people associated with the Trump campaign. Many of the Trump’s campaign personnel, including the president himself, have ties to Russia and Russian interests. This is of course no crime. On the other hand, if the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it aided or abetted the Russians, it would not only be a serious crime, it would also represent one of the most shocking betrayals of democracy in history. In Europe, where the Russians have a much longer history of political interference, they’ve used a variety of techniques to undermine democracy. They employed the hacking and dumping of documents and slick propaganda as they clearly did here. But they’ve also used bribery, blackmail, compromising material, and financial entanglement to secure needed cooperation from individual citizens of targeted countries. The issue of U. S. person involvement is only one of the important matters that the chairman and I have agreed to investigate and which is memorialized in the detailed and bipartisan scope of investigation that we have signed. We’ll also examine whether the intelligence community’s assessment of the Russian operation is supported by the raw intelligence, whether the U. S. government responded properly or missed the opportunity to stop this Russian attack much earlier and whether the leak of information about Michael Flynn or others is indicative of a systemic problem. We have also reviewed whether there is any evidence to support President Trump’s claim that he was wiretapped by President Obama in Trump Tower and found no evidence whatsoever to support that slanderous accusation. And we hope that Director Comey can now put that matter permanently to rest. Today, most of my Democratic colleagues will be exploring with the witnesses the potential involvement of U. S. persons in the Russian attack on our democracy. It is not that we feel the other issues are less important; they are very important, but rather because this issue is least understood by the public. We realize of course that the witnesses may not be able to answer many of the questions in open session. They may or may not be willing to disclose even whether there is an investigation. But we hope to present to you directors and the public why we believe this is a matter of such gravity that it demands a thorough investigation not only by us as we intend to do but by the FBI as well. Let me give you a short preview of what I expect you’ll be asked by our members. Whether the Russian active measures campaign began as nothing more than an attempt to gather intelligence or was always intended to be more than that, we do not know and is one of the questions we hope to answer. But we do know this; the months of July and August 2016 appear to have been pivotal. It was at this time the Russians began using the information they had stolen to help Donald Trump and harm Hillary Clinton. And so the question is, why? What was happening in July, August of last year and were U. S. persons involved? Here are some of the matters drawn from public sources alone since that is all we can discuss in this setting that concern us and we believe should concern all Americans. In early July, Carter Page, someone candidate Trump identified as one of his national security advisors, travels to Moscow on a trip approved by the Trump campaign. While in Moscow, he gives a speech critical of the United States and other western countries for what he believes is a hypocritical focus on democratization and efforts to fight corruption. According to Christopher Steele, a British  —   a former British intelligence officer, who is reportedly held in high regard by U. S. intelligence, Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin, CEO of the Russian gas giant, Rosneft. Sechin is reported to be a former KGB agent and close friend of Putin’s. According to Steele’s Russian sources, Page is offered brokerage fees by such an on a deal involving a 19 percent share of the company. According to Reuters, the sale of a 19. 5 percent share of Rosneft later takes place with unknown purchasers and unknown brokerage fees. Also, according to Steele’s Russian sources, the campaign has offered documents damaging to Hillary Clinton which the Russians would publish through an outlet that gives them deniability like WikiLeaks. The hacked documents would be in exchange for a Trump administration policy that   Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and instead focuses on criticizing NATO countries for not paying their fair share. Policies which even as recently as the President’s meeting last week with Angela Merkel have now presently come to pass. In the middle of July, Paul Manafort, the  —   the Trump campaign manager and someone who was a long on the payroll of Pro   Ukrainian interests attends the Russian  —   the Republican Party Convention. Carter Page, back from Moscow, also attends the convention. According to Steele, it was Manafort who chose Page to serve as a   for the Trump campaign and Russian interests. Ambassador Kislyak, who presides over a Russian Embassy in which diplomatic personnel would later be expelled as likely spies, also attends the Republican Party Convention and meets with Carter Page, and additional Trump advisors J. D. Gordon and Walid Phares. It was J. D. Gordon who approved Page’s trip to Moscow. Ambassador Kislyac also meets with Trump national campaign chair, National Security Campaign Chair and now attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Sessions would later deny meeting with Russian officials during his Senate confirmation hearing. Just prior to the convention, the Republican Party platform is changed, removing a section that supports the provision of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, an action that would be contrary to Russian interests. Manafort categorically denies involvement by the Trump campaign and altering the platform, but the Republican Party delegate who offered the language in support of providing defensive weapons to Ukraine states it was removed at the insistence of the Trump campaign. Later, J. D. Gordon admits opposing the inclusion of the provision of the time it was being debated and prior to its being removed. Later in July and after the convention, the first stolen emails detrimental to Hillary Clinton appear on WikiLeaks. A hacker who goes by the moniker, Guccifer 2. 0, claims responsibility for hacking the DNC and giving the documents to WikiLeaks. A leading private cyber security firms including Crowdstrike, Mandiant and ThreatConnect review the evidence of the hack and conclude with high certainty that it was the work of APT 28 and APT 29 who are known to be Russian intelligence services. The U. S. intelligence committee also later confirms that the documents were in fact stolen by Russian intelligence and Guccifer 2. 0 acted as a front. Also in late July, candidate Trump praises WikiLeaks, says he loves them and openly appeals to the Russians to hack his opponents emails telling them that they will be richly rewarded by the press. On August 8th, Roger Stone, a long time Trump political advisor and   political dirty trickster, boasts in his speech that he has communicated with Assange and that more documents would be coming, including an October surprise. In the middle of August, he also communicates with the Russian cut out Guccifer 2. 0 and authors a Breitbart piece denying Guccifer’s links to Russian intelligence. Then later, in August, Stone does something truly remarkable. When he predicts that John Podesta’s personal emails will soon be published, trust me he says, it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel, #crookedHillary. In the weeks that follow, Stone shows remarkable prescience. I have total confidence that WikiLeaks and my hero, Julian Assange will educate the American people soon, he says, #LockHerUp. Payload coming, he predicts and two days later it does. WikiLeaks releases its first batch of Podesta emails. The release of John Podesta’s emails would then continue on a daily basis, up until the election. On Election Day in November, Donald Trump wins. Donald Trump appoints one of his   surrogates, Michael Flynn, to be his national security advisor. Michael Flynn has been paid by the Kremlin’s propaganda outfit RT in the past, as well as another Russian entity. In December, Michael Flynn has a secret conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, about sanctions imposed by President Obama on Russia over attacking designed to help the Trump campaign. Michael Flynn lies about the secret conversation. The vice president unknowingly then assures the country that no  —   no such conversation ever happened. The president is informed that Flynn has lied and Pence has misled the country. The president does nothing. Two weeks later, the press reveals that Flynn has lied and the president is forced to fire Mr. Flynn. The president then praises the man who lied, Mr. Flynn, and castigates the press for exposing the lie. Now, is it possible that the removal of the Ukraine provision from the GOP platform was a coincidence? Is it a coincidence that Jeff Sessions failed to tell the Senate about his meetings with a Russian ambassador, not only at the convention, but a more private meeting in his office and at a time when the U. S. election was under attack by the Russians? Is it a coincidence that Michael Flynn would lie about a conversation he had with the same Russian Ambassador Kislyak, about the most pressing issue facing both countries at the time they spoke, the U. S. imposition of sanctions over Russian hacking of our election designed to help Donald Trump? Is it a coincidence that the Russian gas company, Rosneft, sold a 19 percent share after former British intelligence officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size? Is it a coincidence that Steele’s Russian sources also affirmed that Russian had stolen documents hurtful to Secretary Clinton that it would utilize in exchange for Pro Russian policies that would later come to pass? Is it a coincidence that Roger Stone predicted that John Podesta would be a victim of a Russian hack and have his private emails published and did so even before Mr. Podesta himself, was fully aware that his private emails would be exposed? Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U. S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don’t know, not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out. Director Comey, what you see on the dais in front of you in the form of this small number of members and staff is all we have to commit to this investigation. This is it. We are not supported by hundreds or thousands of agents and investigators with offices around the world. It is just us and our Senate counterparts. In addition to this investigation we still have our day job which involves overseeing some of the largest and most important agencies in the country. Agencies which by the way are trained to keep secrets. I point this out for two reasons and I’m  —   I’m wrapping up Chairman. First because we cannot do this work alone and nor should we. We believe these issues are so important that the FBI must devote its resources to investigating each of them thoroughly, to do any less would be negligent in the protection of our country. We also need your full cooperation with our investigation so that we may have the benefit of what you know and so that we may coordinate our efforts in the discharge of both our responsibilities. And second, I raise this because I believe that we would benefit from the work of an independent commission that can devote the staff resources to this investigation that we do not have. And it can be completely removed from any political considerations. This should not be a substitute for the work that we, in the intelligence committee, should and must do. But as an important complement to our efforts, just as was the case after  . The stakes are nothing less than the future of our democracy and liberal democracy. Because we’re engaged in a new war of ideas, not communism versus capitalism, but authoritarianism versus democracy and representative government. And in the struggle, our adversary sees our political process as a legitimate field of battle. Only by understanding what the Russians did can we inoculate ourselves from further Russian interference that we know is coming. Only then can we protect our European allies, who are as we speak, enduring similar Russian interference in their own elections. And finally, I want to say a word about our own committee investigation. You will undoubtedly observe in the questions and comments that our members make during today’s hearing that the members of both parties share a common concern over the Russian attack on our democracy. But bring a different perspective on the significance of certain issues or the quantum of evidence we have seen in the early  —   earliest stages of this investigation. This is to be expected. The question most people have is whether we can really conduct this investigation in the kind of thorough and nonpartisan manner that the seriousness of the issues merit or whether the enormous political consequences of our work will make that impossible. The truth is, I don’t know the answer, but I do know this, if this committee can do its work properly, if we can pursue the facts wherever they lead, unafraid to compel witnesses to testify, to hear what they have to say, to learn what we will. And after exhaustive work reach a common conclusion, it would be a tremendous public service and one that is very much in the national interest. So let us try. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and I yield back. NUNES: Thank you. Gentleman yields back. With that that, Admiral Rogers, you’re recognized for five minutes. ROGERS: Thank you sir. Chairman Nunes, Ranking Member Schiff and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today on behalf of the men and women of the National Security Agency. I’m honored to appear besides my teammate Director Comey to discuss Russia’s activities and intentions regarding the 2016 U. S. election. And want to assure the committee that my team is doing its best to fulfill the various requests of this committee to support your ongoing investigations into this subject. ROGERS: Over the past weeks, NSA has been working closely with the committee to provide you the information that you require for your investigation and I can assure you we will continue to do so. When we last met in January, we discussed the classified version of the January intelligence committee  —   community’s assessment on assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U. S. elections. Today, more than two months after we issued this assessment, we stand by it as issued. There is no change in our confidence level on the assessment. Of course, the specifics of this assessment need to remain classified to protect sensitive sources and methods so today I will limit my discussion to information in the public domain, that of the publicly released intelligence community assessment. I hope you will understand that there are some issues I cannot discuss in an open session, nor will I be able to provide specifics in some areas. As the committee fully knows, the intelligence community has a   policy of not discussing surveillance targeting information, in particular cases, as to do so would invariably open the door to compel further disclosures and litigation or the release of classified information, all of which would be harmful to our national security. Like the committee, we are also greatly concerned about leaks of classified information as they can reveal the sources and methods we employ to provide intelligence to American policymakers and warfighters and generate advantage for our nation while protecting its citizens and interest and their privacy. I also want to assure the committee that we take very seriously that obligation to protect U. S. persons’ privacy. This applies to all stages of the production of foreign intelligence, but I’d like to emphasize one area in particular; the dissemination of U. S. person information. We at NSA have strict procedures in place to make sure that our reporting and the contents of our reporting are disseminated only to those that have strict    know for valid purposes which primarily means support of the development of foreign policy and to protect national security. I do want to specifically mention that among the collection and authorities that we have to target foreign actors in foreign spaces, FISA Section 702 and Executive Order 12333 have been instrumental in our ability to produce the intelligence made available to the committee and others in gathering the SIGINT facts of foreign activity in this election cycle. It would be difficult to overstate the breadth and scale of malicious cyber activity occurring today. Our adversaries including nation states have not rested in trying to penetrate government systems, steal our private industries’ intellectual property, and make even greater strides towards the development and achievement of cyber attack capabilities. We have a   and dedicated team at NSA that works every day to generate insights on this activity and to thwart its effectiveness. But cyber defense is a team sport and one of NFA  —   NSA’s strongest partners in this effort is Director Comey’s team at the FBI. And I’m glad to be able to describe here today how we are working together to help protect the nation and our allies to include providing a better understanding of Russian intentions and capabilities. In light of the I. C. assessment and findings, I welcome your investigation into overall Russian activities targeting the previous U. S. elections. NSA continues to employ rigorous analytic standards, applying them in every aspect of our intelligence reporting. Our analysts have consistently proven to be reliable and thorough in their technical and analytic efforts and providing our policymakers and warfighters with SIGINT ammunition to make informed decisions to protect our nation’s freedom and ensure the safety of its citizens. They are diligently continuing to monitor for additional reflections of Russian targeting of U. S. systems and those of our friends and allies around the world to share that information with our I. C. colleagues and foreign counterparts and to share that information with our I. C. colleagues and foreign counterparts and to produce unbiased, unprejudiced and timely reporting of SIGINT facts in their entirety. I look forward your questions. Thank you, sir. NUNES: Thank you, Admiral Rogers. Director Comey, you’re recognized for five minutes. COMEY: Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Schiff, members of the committee, thank you for including me in today’s hearing. I’m honored to be here representing the people of the FBI. I hope we have shown you through our actions and our words how much we at the FBI value your oversight of our work and how much we respect your responsibility to investigate those things are important to the American people. Thank you for showing that both are being taken very seriously. As you know, our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters, but in unusual circumstances where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances. I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed. Because it is an open ongoing investigation and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step in coordination with the Department of Justice of briefing this Congress’ leaders, including the leaders of this committee, in a classified setting in detail about the investigation but I can’t go into those details here. I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand. The FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases and about the people we are investigating. We are also very careful about the way we handle information that may be of interest to our foreign adversaries. Both of those interests are at issue in a counterintelligence investigation. Please don’t draw any conclusions from the fact that I may not be able to comment on certain topics. I know speculating is part of human nature, but it really isn’t fair to draw conclusions simply because I say that I can’t comment. Some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances where the Department of Justice and the FBI have spoken about the details of some investigations, but please keep in mind that those involved the details of completed investigations. Our ability to share details with the Congress and the American people is limited when those investigations are still open, which I hope makes sense. We need to protect people’s privacy. We need to make sure we don’t give other people clues as to where we’re going. We need to make sure that we don’t give information to our foreign adversaries about what we know or don’t know. We just cannot do our work well or fairly if we start talking about it while we’re doing it. So we will try very, very hard to avoid that, as we always do. This work is very complex and there is no way for me to give you a timetable as to when it will be done. We approach this work in an   independent way and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes. I can promise you, we will follow the facts wherever they lead. And I wanna underscore something my friend Mike Rogers said, leaks of classified information are serious, serious federal crimes for a reason. .. (AUDIO GAP) COMEY: . .. they should be investigated and where possible prosecuted in a way that reflects that seriousness so that people understand it simply cannot be tolerated. And I look forward to taking your questions. NUNES: Thank you, Director Comey. Admiral Rogers, first I wanna go to you. On January 6th, 2017, the intelligence community assessment assessing Russian activities and intentions in recent U. S. elections, stated that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying. So my question as of today, Admiral Rogers, do you have any evidence that Russia cyber actors changed vote tallies in the state of Michigan? ROGERS: No I do not, but I would highlight we are a foreign intelligence organization, not a domestic intelligence organization. So it would be fair to say, we are probably not the best organization to provide a more complete answer. NUNES: How about the state of Pennsylvania? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of Wisconsin? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: State of Florida? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of North Carolina? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: The state of Ohio? ROGERS: No, sir. NUNES: So  —   so you have no intelligence that suggests, or evidence that suggests, any votes were changed? ROGERS: I have nothing generated by the national security industry, sir. NUNES: Director Comey, do you have any evidence at the FBI that any votes were changed in the states that I mentioned to Admiral Rogers? COMEY: No. NUNES: Thank you. Admiral Rogers, I know that there was a leak of information regarding Director Clapper and Former Secretary of Defense Carter, were looking at relieving you of your  —   of your duty. Are you aware of those stories? ROGERS: I’m aware of media reporting to that. NUNES: And those stories were leaked as soon as you had visited with   Trump. Is that correct? ROGERS: Yes sir, I was asked if I would be prepared to interview with the Trump administration for a position, which I did. NUNES: Did the leak of that information at all  —   at all impact your ability and your assessment that you did for the intelligence community’s assessment on January 6th? ROGERS: No sir, if I spent time in this job worrying about   sourced media reporting, I’d never get any work done. NUNES: Thank you, Admiral. Director Comey, I remain extremely concerned about the widespread illegal leaks that you just referenced in your  —   in your testimony. Just for the record though, I wanna get this on the record. Does the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to the press violate 18 USC 793, a section of the Espionage Act that criminalizes improperly accessing handling or transmitting national defense information? COMEY: Yes. NUNES: Would an unauthorized disclosure of   information to the press violate 18 USC 798, a section of the Espionage Act that criminalizes the disclosure of information concerning the communication and intelligence activities of the United States? COMEY: Yes, in addition to being a breach of our trust with the FISA Court that oversees our use of those authorities. NUNES: Thank you, Director. At this time, I’m gonna yield to Mr. Rooney, who chairs our NSA cyber committee, for questions. ROONEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to direct my questions, first and foremost, to Admiral Rogers to convey my thanks to the many men and women for their dedication at the NSA for keeping our country safe. As well as I want to talk about the recent media stories, it may have led to confusion in the public about what the NSA is and is not legally collecting in. And the safeguards the NSA has put into place to protect personal data. So I’d like to clarify is the chairman of the subcommittee on the NSA, I recently got to meet your deputy admiral last week out at the NSA and we visited and spoke of some of these things. And what  —   what we can talk about your today publicly, if you could go into, if you can’t, you can’t. But I think that this is important for the people in the room and  —   and listening outside understand. Is it true that the NSA would need a court order based on probable cause to conduct electronic surveillance on a U. S. person inside the United States? ROGERS: Yes sir. ROONEY: And just to be clear, the section of the FISA that is expiring later this year, that’s 702, which will be talking about a little bit, cannot be used to target U. S. persons or persons in the United States, is that correct? ROGERS: Yes sir. ROONEY: Section 702 focuses on  . S. persons outside the United States, primarily correct? ROGERS: Yes sir. ROONEY: Do you believe that the section 702 is important and valuable for U. S. national security? ROGERS: Yes sir. ROONEY: So it’s safe to say that without having this tool, it would be a threat to our national security? ROGERS: It would significantly impact my ability to generate the insights that I believe this nation needs. ROONEY: In the media, there’s a lot of reporting about something called incidental collection. Can you talk about what incidental collection is? ROGERS: Yes sir. Incidental collection is when we are targeting a valid foreign target, for example, in the course of that targeting we either get a reference to a U. S. person or suddenly a U. S. person appears as part of the conversation. That’s what we call incidental collecting. ROONEY: And  —   and what you do when it went something like that happens, if there’s a U. S. person part of an incidental collection, what kind of safeguards are put in place to make sure that. .. ROGERS: So it depends specifically on the legal authority that we’re using to execute the collection in the first place. But in broad terms, realizing again, it varies little bit by the specific authority that we’re using to conduct the collection. We step back and we ask ourselves first, are we dealing with a U. S. person here? Is there something that we didn’t expect to encounter that we’ve now encountered? We’ll ask ourselves what leads us to believe that it is a U. S. person. If we come to the conclusion that it is a U. S. person and we ask ourselves are we  —   are we listening to criminal activity, are we seeing something of imminent threat or danger, for example, or are we just receiving something that has nothing to do with any of our valid collection authority? Based on that, we’ll then take a series of actions. In some case, we will just purge the collect, make no reporting on it, not retain the data. It’s incidental collection, it has no intelligence value and it wasn’t the purpose of what we were doing. In some cases then if we believe that there is intelligence value, for example, whether it’s a reference to a U. S. person, as an example in a scenario. In our reporting then we will mask the identity of the individual. We use a phrase like U. S. person one or U. S. person two. And I would remind everyone that for our purposes, U. S. person is defined very broadly. That is not just a U. S. citizen, that is a U. S. corporation, that is a ship or aircraft that is registered in the United States, that is an Internet protocol address, for example. So it’s not just a particular individual, if that makes sense. The term for us is much broader because designed to ensure our protections of U. S. persons. ROONEY: And this    the procedures and protections you talked about are required and approved by the FISA court, is that correct? ROGERS: Yes sir, and the attorney general. ROONEY: And you mentioned in your opening statement that for that kind of information to be disseminated outside of your agency and the NSA that that dissemination would be strictly on a    basis, is that    is that correct? ROGERS: We use two criteria; is there a need to know in the course of the person or group that is asking for the identification, is there a valid need to know in the course of the execution of their official duties? ROONEY: So like, who would that be? ROGERS: It could be another element with the intelligence community, it could be another element within NSA, it could be a military customer, for example, who’s reading some of our reporting. It could be a policymaker. I apologize, there was one other point I wanted to make, but I’ve lost the thread in my mind. I apologize if I jump in at a moment. .. ROONEY: I’m sorry, I cut you off. ROGERS: I’ll try to make. .. ROONEY: Let’s get back to masking briefly. You spoke about masking and trying to keep a U. S. person’s identity concealed. And when it is disseminated, you    we often talk about in the intelligence community about the exceptions to how    if somebody’s masks, how you unmask them. What would the exceptions to that masking be before it’s disseminated? ROGERS: So again, we use two criteria; the need to know on the person requesting us in the execution of their official duties and the second part was, is the identification necessary to truly understand the context of the intelligence value that the report is designed to generate? Those are the two criteria we use. ROONEY: Is that identity of a U. S. person communicating with a foreign target? Is that ordinarily disseminated in a masked or unmasked form? ROGERS: No. It is normally disseminated, if we    if we make the decision that there’s intelligence value and we’re going to report on it, it is normally disseminated in a masked form. I would    again, as I said, we use a reference, U. S. person one, U. S. person two. .. ROONEY: Right. ROGERS: I would highlight, if you look at the total breadth of our reporting, reporting involving U. S. persons at all is an incredibly small subset in my experience of our total reporting. ROONEY: Who normally in the NSA would make the decision to unmask? ROGERS: There are 20 individuals including myself who I have delegated this authority to approve unmask requests. ROONEY: And does the level of approval change depending on the reason for unmasking? If it was something or somebody, say, really important would that matter or could it be. .. ROGERS: Not    it’s not necessarily designated in writing that way, but certainly by custom and tradition, at times requests will be pushed up to my    I’m the   of the 20 individuals. Requests will be pushed to my level, say ”hey, sir, we just want to make sure that you’re comfortable with this.” ROONEY: Right. So 20 people, that    you know, what procedures or safeguards are put in place to make sure that those 20 people are not unmasking wrongly? ROGERS: So they retrieve specific training, there are specific controls put in place in terms of our ability to disseminate information out of the databases associated with U. S. persons. ROONEY: OK. Let’s run through the exceptions quickly through a following hypothetical. If the NSA collects a communication where a target under surveillance is talking to a U. S. person, how would the NSA determine whether disseminating the U. S. person information is necessary to understanding the foreign intelligence or assess its importance? ROGERS: So first of all, try to understand the nature of the conversation. Is this truly something that involves intelligence or a national security implication for the United States or is this just very normal, reasonable conversations, in which case we have no desire to have any awareness of it, it’s not applicable to our mission. In that case, normally we’ll purge the data. We’ll ask ourselves, is there criminal activity involved, is there a threat, potential threat or harm to U. S. individuals being discussed in a conversation for example. ROONEY: If there was criminal activity involved, what would you do then? ROGERS: If when we disseminate    if we decide we need    if it’s criminal activity, we’ll disseminate the information and if the FBI or other criminal activities are on the reporting stream, in some cases I also will generate a signed letter under my signature in specific cases to Department of Justice highlighting that what we think we have is potential criminal activity, but because we are not a law enforcement or justice organization we’re not in a place to make that determination. ROONEY: OK. Based on that, again, hypothetically, if the NSA obtained the communication of General Flynn while he was communicating with the surveillance target legally, would you please explain how General Flynn’s identity could be unmasked based on the exceptions that we discussed? ROGERS: Sir, I’m not going to discuss even hypotheticals about individuals, I’m sorry. ROONEY: If I could make reference to a Washington Post article that I have here from February 9 which states    do you    let me say what it is and I’ll ask if you’ve read it or    or    or if you’ve seen it. Which states national security under Michael Flynn privately discussed U. S. sanctions against Russia with the country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office. Contrary to public assertions by Trump officials current and    and former U. S. officials said. The article goes on to say that nine current or former    former officials who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the call spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. Did you read this article? ROGERS: I apologize, sir. It’s not    an article that references nine particular individual    it doesn’t necessarily ring a bell. I’ve certainly seen plenty of media reporting that but again, I’m not going to comment on specifics. ROONEY: Just basically under the breath of that article, when we when we hear that nine former, current    or current officials had spoken to the press under the condition of anonymity, and we heard our director Comey and the Chairman speak of this is a potential crime    a serious crime    under the Espionage Act, assuming if this article is accurate, who would have the    who would be in a position to request the unmasking of General Flynn’s identity? Would that be you? ROGERS: I would have the authority to do that. ROONEY: Who else would? ROGERS: The 19 other individuals. ROONEY: Would that include director Comey? ROGERS: I’m talking about. .. ROONEY: In the NSA. .. ROGERS: . .. within the National Security Agency and we’re talking about NSA reporting. ROONEY: But    but would people like Director Comey also be able to request that? ROGERS: Yes. ROONEY: And the attorney general and Director Clapper, are those type of people also on this list? ROGERS: Again, I’m not going to    in general, yes, they would be. .. ROONEY: Generally speaking, not with regard to. .. ROGERS: I’m not going to talk about. .. ROONEY: OK. ROGERS: . .. of an individual or hypothetical scenarios. ROONEY: Well, here’s what I’m trying to get at. If    if    if what we’re talking about is a serious crime as has    as has been alleged, in your opinion, would leaking of an    a U. S. person who has been unmasked and disseminated by intelligence community officials, would that leaking to the press hurt or help our ability to conduct national security matters? ROGERS: Hurt. ROONEY: OK. If    if it hurts    so this leak, which through the 702 tool, which we all agree is vital    or you and I at least agree to that    do you think that that leak actually threatens our national security? If it’s a crime and if it’s unveiling a masked person, and this tool is so important that it can potentially jeopardize this tool when we have to try to reauthorize it in a few months. If this is used against the ability of us to reauthorize this tool and we can’t get it done because whoever did this leak, or these nine people that did this leak, create such a stir, whether it be, you know, in our legislative process or whatever, that they don’t feel confident that a U. S. person under the 702 program can be masked successfully and not leaked to the press, doesn’t that hurt, that leak hurt our national security? ROGERS: Yes, sir. ROONEY: Can you think of any reason why somebody would    would want to leak the identity of a mass person? ROGERS: No sir, I    I mean I have raised this directly with my own workforce over the    over the course of the last few months to remind everyone, part of the ethics of our profession, not just the legal requirement but the ethics of our profession as intelligence professionals is we do not engage in this activity. And I’ve also reminded the men and women of the National Security Agency, if I become aware of any such conduct, there is no place for you on this team. It’s unacceptable to the citizens of the nation that one would engage in this. ROONEY: Well, I think that, you know, as we move forward, obviously, you know, I think that what you’re speaking of is this sacred trust that the intelligence community has with the American people and with the people that are representing them here on this dais. And if we    I think that it’s vital that for those who break that sacred trust, if they are not held accountable whether it by the NSA internally or by the FBI through conviction or   and conviction through the attorney general’s office of that crime, it is very difficult for us to be able to keep that sacred trust to know that what we’re doing is    is    is valid and what we’re doing has no nefarious motivations. And    and    and to us to be able to keep America safe without violating the constitutional protections that we all enjoy. Mr. Chairman, I’m not sure how much more time I have left. I just wanted to. .. ROGERS: Congressman, can I make one comment if I could, I apologize. ROONEY: Yes, sir. ROGERS: It comes to my mind based on your question, I just wanna remind everyone and in general. FISA collection on targets in the United States has nothing to do with 702, I just wanna make sure we’re not confusing the two things, here, 702 is collection overseas against  . S. persons. ROONEY: Right and    and what    and what we’re talking about here, is incidentally, if a U. S. person is talking to a foreign person that we’re listening to, whether or not that person is unmasked. .. ROGERS: I just wanna make sure we all understand the context, that’s all. ROONEY: Right, right, and    and whether or not somebody in the intelligence community that we put the trust in, is going to leak that information to the press, for whatever reason. And I’m not even gonna get into the gratuitous, you know, what that reason may be. But it’s really gonna hurt the people on this committee and you all on the intelligence community, when we try to retain this tool this year. And try to convince some of our colleagues that this is really important for national security, when somebody in the intelligence community says you know what? The hell with it, I’m gonna release this person’s name because I’m gonna get something out of it. We’re all gonna be hurt by that if we can’t reauthorize this tool, do you agree with that? ROGERS: Yes, sir. ROONEY: Mr. Chairman, do I    do I have enough time to talk about the letter the committee sent? NUNES: Sure. ROONEY: The committee sent to you on March 15th, a letter    yeah, to Admiral Rogers and to Director Comey. Have you had a chance to look at this letter? I think that you’ve actually. .. (CROSSTALK) ROGERS: Yes sir, I in fact have given you a reply on the 17th. ROONEY: Just real    real quickly because I don’t want to take up any more time. Can you give us a sense of how many unmasked U. S. persons identities were disseminated by the NSA from June 2016 to June 2017? ROGERS: No sir. As I have indicated where the process of compiling that information. I will provide it to the committee. But until that work is done, I am not gonna comment. ROONEY: Can you tell us whether any of those disseminations broadly were involved U. S. people relating to presidential candidates Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton, and their associates in 2016? ROGERS: I won’t answer until I complete the research sir. ROONEY: Assuming that the NSA disseminated unmasked U. S. persons information relating to the Trump or Clinton campaigns, would that have been a reason for such unmasking? ROGERS: I apologize. I don’t truly understand the question. ROONEY: Let me just move on to the next one. Along those lines, if the NSA had wanted disseminate unmasked U. S persons information related to either the presidential campaign, who in the NSA would have approved such dissemination’s? ROGERS: Again, it would’ve been one of the 20 and I provided that in my initial response to the committee. I have outlined the procedures, I’ve outlined the specific 20 individuals. ROONEY: Thank you, Admiral. I appreciate your    your answers. I look forward to working with you on the subcommittee moving forward. And Mr. Chairman, I yield back. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Gowdy is recognized. GOWDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Comey, we will begin on this line of questioning, then we’ll finish it the next round. FISA and other similar related counterterrorism programs have been described, even this morning, as vital, critical and indispensable to our national security. And many of us on both sides of the aisle believe FISA and similar counterterrorism programs prevent terrorist attacks and save American lives. But FISA and other surveillance programs are intentionally designed to preserve the privacy of U. S. citizens. They are intentionally designed to ensure the information is collected and used only for legitimate national security and criminal investigative purposes. There are statutory safeguards, there are warrants based on probable calls, there is a FISA court that is involved, there are audits on the backend and we think so highly of this material. It is a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in federal prison to unlawfully disseminate it. All of this was done to make sure this information gathered remains protected as it relates to U. S. citizens. The way I view it, Director Comey, the American people have an agreement with their government. We are going to give you the tools to keep us safe, even if it infringes on our privacy Psalm (ph). We’re going to give you the tools. And government in return promises to safeguard the privacy of U. S. citizens. And when that deal is broken, it jeopardizes American trust in the surveillance program. So let me ask you, do you agree FISA is critical to our national security? COMEY: I do. GOWDY: Do you agree programs like FISA were intentionally designed to safeguard the identity of U. S. persons? COMEY: Yes, there are other    other important elements of it but that’s a primary goal, I believe. GOWDY: It wasn’t an afterthought, it wasn’t an accident. These are intentional safeguards that we put in place to protect U. S. citizens, is that correct? COMEY: Correct. GOWDY: Do you agree much of what is learned from these programs is classified or otherwise legally protected? COMEY: All FISA applications review by the court collection by us pursuant to our FISA authority is classified. GOWDY: The dissemination of which is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison? COMEY: Sure, dissemination    unauthorized dissemination. GOWDY: Unauthorized dissemination of classified or otherwise legally protected material punishable by a felony up to 10 years in federal prison. COMEY: Yes. Yes, as it should be. GOWDY: All right. In January of this year, the Washington Post reported, according to a senior U. S. government official, a named U. S. citizen    and I will not use the name    a named U. S. citizen phoned the Russian ambassador several times on December 29. In February of this year, the Washington Post reported nine, nine current and former officials who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the call, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters and that officials began pouring over intelligence reports, intercepted communications, and diplomatic cables. In February of this year, the New York Times reported a U. S. citizen, whose name I will not use, discusses sanctions with the Russian ambassador in a phone call according to officials who have seen a transcript of the wiretapped conversation. And again in February of this year, the New York Times reported on a phone call involving a U. S. citizen including significant discussions of phone records, intercepted calls, intercepted communications, and reported the NSA captured calls and then asked the FBI to collect as much information as possible. My time is up so I will say this for this round. I thought it was against the law to disseminate classified information. Is it? COMEY: Yes, sir. It’s a serious crime. I’m not going to comment on those particular articles because I don’t want to, in any circumstance, compound a criminal act by confirming that it was classified information but in general, yes, it’s a serious crime and it should be for the reasons you said. GOWDY: We’ll take it back up next round, Mr. Chairman. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. I’ll now yield 15 minutes to Mr. Schiff. SCHIFF: Director Comey, I want to begin by attempting to put to rest several claims made by the president about his predecessor, namely that President Obama wiretapped his phones. So that we can be precise, I want to refer you to exactly what the president said and ask you whether there is any truth to it. First, the president claimed, quote, ”Terrible. Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism,” unquote. Director Comey, was the president’s statement that Obama had his wires tapped in Trump Tower a true statement? COMEY: With respect to the president’s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI. The Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components. The department has no information that supports those tweets. SCHIFF: The president accused Mr. Obama and presumably the FBI of engaging in McCarthyism. As you understand the term McCarthyism, do you think President Obama or the FBI was engaged in such conduct? COMEY: I’m not to try and characterize the tweets themselves. All I can tell you is we have no information that supports them. SCHIFF: Were you engaged in McCarthyism, Director Comey? COMEY: I try very hard not to engage in any isms of any kind, including    including McCarthyism. SCHIFF: The president second stated quote ”Is it legal for a sitting president to be wiretapping a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by a court earlier, a new low,” unquote. Director Comey, can you answer the president’s question? Would it be legal for present Obama to have ordered a wiretap of Donald Trump? COMEY: I’m not going to characterize or respond to the tweets themselves. I can tell you in general, as    as Admiral Rogers and I were just saying, there is a statutory framework in the United States under which courts grant permission for electronic surveillance either in a criminal case or a national security case based on a showing of probable cause, carefully overseen. It’s a rigorous, rigorous process that involves all three branches of government, and it’s one we’ve lived with since the late 1970s. That’s how it works. So no individual in the United States can direct electronic surveillance of anyone, it has to go through an application process, ask a judge, the judge can I make the order. SCHIFF: So President Obama could not unilaterally order a wiretap of anyone? COMEY: No president could. SCHIFF: Mr. Trump also asserted in that tweet that he was    that the application    or the president’s order was turned down by a court. Was there any request made by the FBI or Justice Department to wiretap Donald Trump turned down by a court? COMEY: That’s one of those subjects I can’t comment on one way or another. Please don’t interpret that in any way other than I just can’t talk about anything that relates to the Pfizer process in an open setting. SCHIFF: Third, the president stated, I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to the election. Director Comey, you’re a good lawyer. Can you make out a great case that president Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump’s phones just prior to the election in light of the fact you’ve said there is no evidence of that? COMEY: All I can say is what I said before, that we don’t have any information that supports those tweets. SCHIFF: Well, in my view then, you would not be a great, but very unethical lawyer to make up such a case. And finally, the president made the following accusation. How low has president Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process? This is  . Bad or sick guy. Director Comey, the president has compared Mr. Obama to Nixon and purported wiretap of Trump phones as another Watergate. What was the gravamen of the offense by Nixon and his operatives during Watergate? A lot of people who may be watching may be too young. SCHIFF: To understand what Watergate was about, what was the gravament of that offense? COMEY: Well, as I recall it then, I was a kid, but I’ve studied it quite a bit in school. The gravament of it was an abuse of power including   unlawful wire taps, obstruction of justice, sort of the cycle of criminal conduct. SCHIFF: There was a   of the democratic headquarters by operatives of the president, was it not? COMEY: That’s my understanding is that’s how it began    the investigation began. SCHIFF: It also involve the cover up by the president. COMEY: Yes, as I said. SCHIFF: Now here, I think you’ve said there’s been no evidence of an illegal wiretap by president Obama, is that right? COMEY: I’ve said the FBI and the Department of Justice have no information to support those tweets. SCHIFF: But there is evidence, is there not, of a break in of the democratic headquarters by a foreign power using cyber means? COMEY: Yes there was, as the    as the intelligence community report, the   report, said in January, the Russian intelligence services hacked into a number of enterprises in the United States, including the Democratic National Committee. SCHIFF: And there was an effort by the Russians to cover up their   of the Democratic Party headquarters, by using cutouts like WikiLeaks to publish the stolen material, isn’t that right? COMEY: Certainly to cover up their    that they were the ones releasing it. SCHIFF: Director Rogers, in an effort to explain why there was no evidence supporting the president’s claim that Obama had wiretapped him, the president and his spokesman, Sean Spicer, have suggested that British intelligence through its NSA or GCHQ wiretapped Mr. Trump on President Obama’s behalf. Did you ever request that your counterparts in GCHQ should wiretap Mr. Trump on behalf of President Obama? ROGERS: No sir, nor would I, that would be expressly against the construct of the Five Eyes agreement that’s been in place for decades. SCHIFF: And the Five Eyes are some of our closest intelligence partners and Britain    Britain is one of them? ROGERS: Yes, sir. SCHIFF: Have you seen any evidence that anyone else in the Obama administration made such a request? ROGERS: No sir, and again, my view is the same as Director Comey, I’ve seen nothing on the NSA side that we engaged in any such activity, nor that anyone ever asked us to engage in such activity. SCHIFF: And if you were to ask the British to spy on America, that would be a violation of U. S. law, would it not? ROGERS: Yes, sir. SCHIFF: Our relationship with British intelligence is one of the closest we have with any foreign services, isn’t that true? ROGERS: Yes, sir. SCHIFF: Now, the British allies    our British allies have called the president’s suggestion that they wiretapped him for Obama nonsense and utterly ridiculous. Would you agree? ROGERS: Yes, sir. SCHIFF: Does it do damage to our relationship with one of our closest intelligence partners for the president to make a baseless claim that the British participated in a conspiracy against him? ROGERS: I think it clearly frustrates a key ally of ours. SCHIFF: Certainly wouldn’t endear the British intelligence services to continue working with us, would it? ROGERS: I believe that the relationship is strong enough, this is something we’ll be able to deal with. SCHIFF: But it’s not helpful. .. ROGERS: Yes, sir. .. SCHIFF: . .. you would agree? ROGERS: . .. that    that. .. SCHIFF: Director Rogers, President Trump recently met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a joint press conference, the president suggested that they both had something in common, that they had both been wiretapped by President Obama. Director Comey has just demonstrated why the claims by the president about his being wiretapped by Obama were unsupported by any evidence. But the claim he made about wiretapping directed at Merkel referred to something that came up in the context of the Snowden disclosures. I’m not going to ask you to comment on whether the Chancellor was the subject of any eavesdropping. But I would like to ask you whether the Snowden disclosures did damage to our relationship with our German ally and whether the Chancellor herself expressed her concern at the time. ROGERS: Yes, sir. SCHIFF: In light of this, is it helpful to our relationship with the Chancellor or our relationship with German intelligence, to bring this up again in a public forum? ROGERS: It certainly complicates things. But again, I’d like to think that our relationship is such we’re gonna be able to deal and keep moving forward. SCHIFF: So our relationships with the British and the Germans, you hope, are strong enough to withstand any damage done by these comments? ROGERS: By anything in general, sir. We have foundational interest with each other, we need to keep working together. SCHIFF: This time, Director Comey, let me ask you a few questions you may or may not be able to answer. Do you know who Roger Stone is? COMEY: Generally, yes. SCHIFF: Are you aware that he was a partner of Paul Manafort? COMEY: Mr. Schiff, I’m worried we’re going to a place I don’t want to go, which is commenting on any particular person. And so I    I don’t think I should comment. I’m aware of public accounts but I don’t want to talk more than that. SCHIFF: Are you aware that he has publicly acknowledged having directly communicated with (inaudible) someone that the intelligence community has assessed was a person of Russian intelligence? COMEY: I’ve read media accounts to that effect. I don’t wanna hurt anybody’s feeling in the media. I don’t know whether that’s accurate or not. SCHIFF: If Mr. Stone acknowledged Mr. Podesta’s time in the barrel was coming in August 2016, would that have been prior to the public release of stolen   of Mr. Podesta’s? COMEY: I believe that’s the correct chronology. SCHIFF: Do you know how Mr. Stone would’ve known that Mr. Podesta’s   were going to be released? COMEY: That’s not something I can comment on. SCHIFF: Do you know that Mr. Podesta has said that at the time he was not even aware whether his   had been stolen would be published? COMEY: That’s nothing something I comment on. SCHIFF: At this point Mr. Chairman, I’m going to yield to Mr. Himes. HIMES: Thank you to the ranking member. And gentlemen, thank you for being with us today. Let me    when I get my own time I’ll    I’ll    I’ll have some   questions. But let me start with a point that the chairman brought out I think very specifically which is that there’s no evidence that votes were technically changed in any of the jurisdictions that he named. Admiral Rogers, thanks for confirming that, but am I correct, that the    when we say Russian hacking what we are referring to is the fact that the intelligence community believes that the Russians penetrated the networks of the DNC, of John Podesta, and other individuals, stole information and then disseminated that information. Is that a fair characterization of the    of the conclusions of the intelligence community? ROGERS: Yes sir. HIMES: And did the intelligence community ever do an analysis as to whether the dissemination of that adverse information in a closely fought election had any effect on the American electorate? ROGERS: No sir. The U. S. intelligence community does not do assessments . .. HIMES: Of course not. (CROSSTALK) ROGERS: . .. U. S. opinion. HIMES: That’s    that’s    that’s not your job. ROGERS: No sir. HIMES: The fact is, those of us who go through campaigns know that’s actually something we probably have a little bit more understanding of. Let me just ask this question then. Was there any equivalent dissemination of adverse information stolen from the RNC or individuals associated with the Trump campaign? COMEY: No. HIMES: Thank you. Director Comey, in    in the remaining minutes here. I appreciate your frankness on the topic of an ongoing investigation and appreciate your inability to go too much further than you went. But I do want to ask you a question to try to clear up some confusion. This committee, of course, is engaged in investigation about links, as you said, between the Trump campaign and the Russians, should there be any possible collusion. We’ve had a number of statements very early in the investigation that there was no evidence of collusion. This is still very early in our investigation, is it fair to say that you’re still relatively early in your investigation? COMEY: It’s hard to say because I don’t how much longer it will take. But we’ve been doing this    this investigation began in late July, so for counterintelligence investigation that’s a fairly short period of time. HIMES: So, you used the word coordination which to me suggests that you are in fact investigating whether there was coordination between U. S. persons and the Russians. Is it fair for me to assume that we shouldn’t simply dismiss the possibility that there was coordination or collusion between the Russian efforts and U. S. persons as an investigatory body? COMEY: Well all I can tell you is what we’re investigating which includes whether there was any coordination between people associated with the Trump campaign and the Russians. HIMES: OK. Thank you, I’ll yield the remaining time to the ranking member. SCHIFF: I will yield the remaining time this period to Representative Sewell. SEWELL: Thank you. So, with respect to the coordination, Director Comey, I just wanted to continue this line of questioning, can you say with any specificity what kinds of coordination or contacts you’re looking at in your investigation generally when confronted with something like this? COMEY: I can’t. SEWELL: Can you discuss whether or not there was any knowledge by any   related person and the Russians? COMEY: I can’t. SEWELL: So with respect to any ongoing investigation, whether the specificity of the person, U. S. person or otherwise, you can’t comment on any of that. COMEY: Correct. SEWELL: OK. Can you characterize what the nature of your investigation generally, wouldn’t    when you do an investigation of this sort, can you talk a little bit about the process, generally? COMEY: Not a whole lot. I can tell you we use our great, great people, we coordinate with our brothers and sisters in other parts of the intelligence community to see what they may know from around the world that might be useful to us and we use all the different tools and techniques that we use in all of our investigations. That’s probably the most    I’m not sure that’s useful to you, but that’s the most I can say. SEWELL: How long does a counterintelligence investigation like this usually take? You said that it started in July. COMEY: There is no usually. It’s hard    it’s impossible to say, frankly. SEWELL: I yield back my time. NUNES: Thank you, Ms. Sewell. We’ll go back to    I’ll yield myself 15 minutes and we’ll go back to Mr. Gowdy. GOWDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Comey, you and I were discussing the felonious dissemination of classified material during the last round. Is there an exception in the law for current or former U. S. officials who request anonymity? COMEY: To release classified information? GOWDY: Yes sir. COMEY: No. GOWDY: Is there an exception in the law for reporters who want to break a story? COMEY: Well that’s a harder question as to whether a reporter incurs criminal liability by publishing classified information and one probably beyond my ken. I’m not as good a lawyer as Mr. Schiff said I used to be. GOWDY: Well, I don’t know about that but the statute does use the word published, doesn’t it? COMEY: It does, but that’s a question I know the Department of Justice has struggled with through administration after administration. GOWDY: I know the department struggled with it, the 4th Circuit struggled with it, lots of people have struggled with it but you’re not aware of an exception in the current dissemination of classified information statute that carves out an exception for reporters. COMEY: No, I’m not aware of anything carved out in the statute. I don’t think a reporter’s been prosecuted certainly in my lifetime though. GOWDY: Well, there’ve been a lot of statutes that bore on this investigation for which no one’s ever been prosecuted or convicted and that does not keep people from discussing those statutes, namely the Logan Act. In theory, how would reporters know a U. S. citizen made a telephone call to an agent of a foreign power? COMEY: How would they know legally? GOWDY: Yes. COMEY: If it was declassified and then discussed in a judicial proceeding or congressional hearing. Something like that. GOWDY: And assume none of those facts are at play, how would they know? COMEY: Someone told them who shouldn’t have told them. GOWDY: How would a reporter know about the existence of intercepted phone calls? COMEY: Same thing. In a    in a legitimate way, through a appropriate proceeding where there’s been declassification. In any other way, in an illegitimate way. GOWDY: How would reporters know if a transcript existed of an intercepted communication? COMEY: Same answer. It    it    the only legitimate way would be through a proceeding    appropriate proceeding, the illegitimate way would be somebody told him who shouldn’t have told them. GOWDY: What does the term mask mean in the concept of FISA and other surveillance programs? COMEY: As Director Rogers explained, it’s our practice, approved by the FISA court, of removing the names of U. S. persons to protect their privacy and their identity unless it hits certain exceptions. So masking means, as Mike Rogers said    I’ll often see a intelligence report from NSA that will say U. S. person number one, U. S. person number two, U. S. person number three and there’s no further identification on the document. GOWDY: Admiral Rogers said there are 20 people within the NSA that are part of the unmasking process. How many people within the FBI are part of the unmasking process? COMEY: I don’t know for sure. As I sit here, surely more, given the nature the FBI’s work. We come into contact with U. S. persons a whole lot more than the NSA does because we may be conducting    we only conduct our operations in the United States to collect electronic surveillance    to conduct electronic surveillance, so I don’t    I can find out the exact number, I don’t know it as I sit here. GOWDY: Well, I think, Director Comey, given the fact that you and I agree this is critical, vital, indispensable, a similar program is coming up for reauthorization this fall with a pretty strong head wind right now. It would be nice to know the universe of people who have the power to unmask a U. S. citizen’s name. Because that might provide something of a roadmap to investigate who might’ve actually disseminated a masked U. S. citizen’s name. COMEY: Sure. The number is relevant but what I hope the U. S.    the American people realize is the number’s important, but the culture behind it is in fact even more important. The training, the rigor, the discipline. We are obsessive about FISA in the FBI for reasons I hope make sense to this committee but we are    everything that’s FISA has to be labeled in such a way to warn people this is FISA, we treat this in a special way. So we can get you the number, but I want to assure you the culture of the FBI and the NSA around how we treat U. S. person information is obsessive and I mean that in a good way. GOWDY: Director Comey, I am not arguing with you and I do agree that culture is important, but if there are 100 people who have the ability to unmask and the knowledge of a previously masked name, then that’s 100 different potential sources of investigation and the smaller the number is, the easier your investigation is. So the number is relevant. I can see the culture is relevant. NSA, FBI, what other U. S. government agencies have the authority to unmask a U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: I think all agencies that collect information pursuant to FISA have what are called standard minimization procedures, which are approved by the FISA court that govern how they will treat U. S. person information. So I know the NSA does, I know the CIA does, obviously the FBI does. I don’t know for sure beyond that. GOWDY: How about the department of    how about Main Justice? COMEY: Main Justice, I think does have standard minimization procedures. GOWDY: All right, so that’s four. The NSA, FBI, CIA, Main Justice. Does the White House have the authority to unmask a U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: I think other elements of the government that are consumers of our products can ask the collectors to unmask. The unmasking resides with those who collected the information. And so if Mike Rogers’s folks collected something and they sent it to me in a report and it says U. S. person number one and it’s important for the FBI to know who that is, our request will go back to them. The White House can make similar requests of the FBI or of NSA but they can’t on their    they don’t own their own collect and so they can’t on their own unmask. I got that about right? ROGERS: No, that’s correct. COMEY: Yeah. GOWDY: I guess what I’m getting at, Director Comey, is you say it’s vital, you say it’s critical, you say it’s indispensable. We both know it’s a threat to the reauthorization of 702 later on this fall. And by the way, it’s also a felony punishable by up to 10 years. So how would you begin your investigation, assuming for the sake of argument that a U. S. citizen’s name appeared in the Washington Post and the New York Times unlawfully. Where would you begin that investigation? COMEY: Well, I’m not gonna talk about any particular investigation. .. GOWDY: That’s why I said in theory. COMEY: You would start by figuring out, so who are the suspects? Who touched the information that you’ve concluded ended up unlawfully in the newspaper and start with that universe and then use investigative tools and techniques to see if you can eliminate people, or include people as more serious suspects. GOWDY: Do you know whether Director Clapper knew the name of the U. S. citizen that appeared in the New York Times and Washington Post? COMEY: I can’t say in this forum because again, I don’t wanna confirm that there was classified information in the newspaper. GOWDY: Would he have access to an unmasked name? COMEY: In    in some circumstances, sure, he was the director of national intelligence. But I’m not talking about the particular. GOWDY: Would Director Brennan have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: In some circumstances, yes. GOWDY: Would National Security Adviser Susan Rice have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: I think any    yes, in general, and any other national security adviser would, I think, as a matter of their ordinary course of their business. GOWDY: Would former White House Advisor Ben Rhodes have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: I don’t know the answer to that. GOWDY: Would former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have access to an unmasked U. S. citizen’s name? COMEY: In general, yes, as would any attorney general. GOWDY: So that would also include Acting AG Sally Yates? COMEY: Same answer. GOWDY: Did you brief President Obama on    well, I’ll just ask you. Did you brief President Obama on any calls involving Michael Flynn? COMEY: I’m not gonna get into either that particular case that matter, or any conversations I had with the president. So I can’t answer that. GOWDY: Well, Director Comey, there’s been some speculation this morning on motive. I’m not all that interested in motive    first of all, its really hard to prove. Secondarily, you never have to prove it. But I get that people wanna know, I get the jury all wants    always wants to know why. I think you and I can agree there are a couple of reasons that you would not have to unlawfully, feloniously, disseminate classified material. It certainly wasn’t done to help an ongoing criminal investigation, because you already had the information, didn’t you? COMEY: Again, I can’t answer in the context of this particular matter. GOWDY: How about in theory? Is    is    is there something a reporter would have access to that the head of the FBI would not? COMEY: It’s hard for me to answer, I would hope not when it relates to the FBI. .. GOWDY: I would hope not too, since its part of our surveillance programs. I would hope that you had access to everything as the head of the world’s premier   agency. I would hope that you had it all. So if you had it all, the motive couldn’t have been to help you, because you already had it. And Admiral Rogers, the motive couldn’t have been to help you, because you already had it. So in the universe of possible motives for the felonious dissemination of classified material, we could rule out wanting to help the intelligence and the law enforcement communities. Those are two motives are gone now. That leaves some more nefarious motives. Is the investigation into the leak of classified information    has it begun yet? COMEY: I can’t say because I don’t want to confirm that that was classified information. GOWDY: Well, I’m    I don’t want to quarrel with you Director Comey and I    I do understand that you cannot ordinarily confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. But you did it this morning, citing DOJ policy given the gravity of the fact pattern. Would you not agree that surveillance programs that are critical, indispensable, vital to our national security, some of which are awful reauthorization this fall, that save American lives and prevent terrorist attacks also rises to the level of important? COMEY: I think those programs are vital and leaks of information collected pursuant to court order under those programs are terrible. And as I said in my opening statement should be taken very, very seriously. What I don’t ever want to do is compound what bad people have done and confirm something that’s in the newspaper. Because sometimes newspaper get it right, there’s a whole lotta wrong information about    about classified activities that’s in the newspaper. We don’t call them and correct them either. That’s another big challenge but we just don’t go anywhere near it because we don’t want to help and compound the offense that was committed. GOWDY: I understand that Director Comey. And I’m trying really hard not to get you to discuss the facts at bar (ph). But some of the words that appeared in this public reporting, include the word transcript which has a very unique use in the matters that you and I are discussing this morning. That is a very unique use of that word, wiretap has a very specific meaning. The name of a U. S. citizen that was supposed to statutorily be protected, is no longer protected. So some of this reporting    let’s assume 90 percent of it is inaccurate, that other 10 percent is still really, really important. And to the extent that you can rely on the dates in either the Washington Post or the New York Times, we are talking about February of this year is when the reporting first took place. So we are    we’re a month and a half or two months into something that you and I agree, is incredibly important and also happens the felony. So I’m just simply asking you to assure the American people, you’ve already assured them you take it really seriously. Can you assure them that it is going to be investigated? COMEY: I can’t but I hope    I hope people watching know how seriously we take leaks of classified information. But I don’t want to confirm it by saying that were investigating it. And I’m sorry I have to draw the line, I just think that’s the right way to be. GOWDY: Well I’m not argue with you Director Comey but it is    we’re going to discuss a lot of important things today. Whether Russia attempted to influence our democratic process is incredibly important. Whether they sought to influence it as a separate analysis, incredibly important. The motive behind that interference and influence, incredibly important. Our U. S. response, incredibly important. Some of that may rise to the level of the crime, some of it does not rise to level of a crime. One thing you and I agree on is the felonious dissemination of class    classified material most definitely is a crime. So I would ask you and I understand some of the procedures that you are up against. I would    I would humbly ask you to    to seek authority from whomever you need to seek authority from. Because I’m going to finish the same way I started. This is an agreement between the American people and its government. We are going to    we the American people give certain powers to government to keep us safe. And when those powers are misused and the motive is not criminal investigations or national security, then I’ll bet you my fellow citizens are rethinking their side of the equation. Because that U. S. citizen could be them next time. It could be you. It could be me. It could be anyone until we start seriously investigating and prosecuting what Congress thought was serious enough to attach a   year felony to. With that, I would yield back, Mr. Chairman. COMEY: Can I    can I just add a response to what you said? I agree with you, Mr. Gowdy. Two things folks at home should know; first, an unauthorized disclosure of FISA is an extraordinarily unusual event so be assured we’re going to take it very seriously because our trust, the American people, and the federal judges that oversee our work, is vital. And second, that this conversation has nothing to do with 702. Folks often mix them together. 702 is about targeting  . S. persons overseas. Pursuant to the FISA statute, the FBI can apply to collect electronic surveillance in the United States but it’s a different thing from 702. The conversation you and I are just having is about this which is vital and important, but I just didn’t want to leave folks confused. GOWDY: Director Comey, you are 100 percent correct and I am 100 percent correct in saying that that is a distinction that doesn’t make a difference to most of the people watching television. You are exactly correct. What we are reauthorizing this fall has nothing to do with what we are discussing other than it is another government program where the people consent to allow government to pursue certain things with the explicit promise it will be protected. So you’re right, they’re different but in the eyes of people watching, it is the U. S. government officials’ leaking the name of a U. S. citizen and if it can happen here, it may happen there. Trust me, you and I both want to see it reauthorized. It is in jeopardy if we don’t get this resolved. NUNES: Our time is expired, I’ll yield 15 minutes to Mr. Schiff. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to follow up with a few questions about Roger Stone that I had started with earlier before I passed it to my colleagues. Director Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign? COMEY: I’m not going to talk about any particular person here today, Mr. Schiff. SCHIFF: I’m going to continue to ask these questions because among other things, I want to make sure you are aware of these facts whether you’re able to comment on them political dirty tricks? COMEY: I’ll give you the same answer, sir. SCHIFF: I mentioned before that Mr. Stone was in direct communication with a creature of Russian GRU, Guccifer 2. 0 and that’s something the intelligence assessment talked about, the role of Guccifer 2. 0. Mr. Stone on August 17, are you aware, received communication from Guccifer 2. 0 that said, quote ”I’m pleased to say that you are great. Please tell me if I can help you any how. It would be a great pleasure to me.” Are you aware of that communication from essentially Russian GRU through Guccifer to Mr. Stone? COMEY: I have to give you the same answer. SCHIFF: Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks? COMEY: Same answer. SCHIFF: Are you aware that Mr. Stone also claimed that he was in touch with an intermediary of Mr. Assange? COMEY: Same answer. SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary? COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn’t deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D. C. Leaks and Guccifer 2. 0. SCHIFF: In early October, are you aware that Mr. Stone tweeted I have total confidence that my hero, Julian Assange will educate the American people soon. Are you aware of that tweet? COMEY: I’m back to my original same answer. SCHIFF: And are you aware that it was only days later that WikiLeaks released the Podesta  ? COMEY: Same answer. SCHIFF: I’m going to yield now to Mr. Himes. HIMES: Thank you, Mr. Schiff. I know that we’re going through the 90 minute mark in this hearing so let me step back a second and just review the topics because there’s a lot on the table and I think my friends on the Republican side will get no argument from this side on the importance of investigating, prosecuting leaks. Leaks are a threat to our national security whether they’re perpetrated by Edward Snowden, whether they’re perpetrated by people outside the White House or perhaps as we have seen in the last 60 days, maybe from people inside the White House. But Mr. Comey, if I can use your phrase, intense public interest. There is intense public interest in the fact that our new president will attack anyone and everyone. He will attack the cast of Hamilton, he will attack Chuck Schumer, he will attack our allies, Mexico, Australia, Germany, he will attack the intelligence community, which you lead. Associating you with McCarthyism and Nazism. But there’s one person in one country which is immune, which is inoculated from any form of presidential attack no matter what the behavior. No matter if there’s a violation of the INF nuclear treaty, no matter if Vladimir Putin kills political opponents, the new president defends, obfuscates, does not attack. And the people around the president, Michael Flynn, Jeff Sessions, Carter Page, Paul Manafort, have an odd connection to Russia. A series of odd connections. We all campaigned. I don’t think any of our campaign people have connections with a foreign power, much less one that is an adversary of the United States. And further, apart from these weird links, without exception, the individuals I’ve quoted have dissembled or misled, maybe even lied about the nature of those    those connections until the political pressure has gotten to a point where they have been fired or recused, in the case of the Attorney General. So I want to look briefly at one of these individuals    and Director Comey, I understand your constraints but    but let me ask a couple of questions regardless. Paul Manafort, who is Roger Stone’s business partner and former    and Trump’s former campaign manager, I want to ask you a few questions about him. First, Director Comey, can you tell me what the Foreign Agents Registration Act is? COMEY: Sure. Not in an expert way, but it’s a statute that requires people who are acting as agents of a  . S. government to register with the United States. HIMES: Right. So the National Security Division of the Department of Justice writes    this is their manual. The purpose of FARA, as it is known, is to ensure that the U. S. government and the people of the United States are informed of the source of information and the identity of persons attempting to influence U. S. public opinion, policy, and laws. Unquote. Would you agree that guarding against foreign espionage or foreign influence measures falls under this heading? COMEY: Yes. HIMES: In general, is willful violation or failure to register pursuant to this law in some circumstances a crime? COMEY: I believe it is. I’m not an expert on FARA, but I believe it is. HIMES: And it could lead, certainly, to counterintelligence concerns, right? COMEY: Yes. HIMES: Now, Paul Manafort, as reported in the New York Times and other outlets and his deputy, Rick Gates ran a campaign in Washington to lobby government officials and push positive press coverage of pro   officials. Paul Manafort began officially working for former Ukrainian President Yanukovych at least as far back as 2007, according to the Washington Post. The lobbying was only discovered by Ukraine’s new National   Corruption Bureau, which found secret ledgers in Kiev, indicating almost $13 million in undisclosed cash payments from Ukrainian government coffers (ph) to Paul Manafort for lobbying done between 2007 and 2012, for Mr. Yanukovych    Yanukovych. Director Comey, did Paul Manafort ever register as a foreign agent under FARA? COMEY: That’s not something I can comment on. HIMES: Whether he registered or not is not something that you can comment on? COMEY: No. HIMES: OK. Paul Manafort was, however, Donald Trump’s campaign manager in July of 2016, correct? COMEY: Mr. Himes, I really don’t wanna get into answering questions about any individual U. S. person. HIMES: OK. .. COMEY: Look, I’m    it’s obvious from the public record. But I don’t wanna start down the road of answering questions about somebody. HIMES: OK. Well, I think the facts would show that he never did register. But as the ranking member pointed out, it perhaps should come as no surprise that the Republican platform, which was drafted at the Republican Convention in July of 2016, underwent a pretty significant change with respect to the American response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and their aggression in that country. It appears, from our standpoint, that we had    we had perhaps somebody who should’ve registered under FARA pulling the strings, there. There’s more though and I don’t know how much you’ll be able to comment on this. But I wanna just explore for a second, the nature of the Russian government, because oftentimes the question becomes, was there contact with Russian officials. And I want to read you a brief quote from a book on Putin’s government. This is by Professor Karen Dawisha who wrote, ”Instead of seeing Russian politics as an inchoate democratic system being pulled down by history, accidental autocrats, popular inertia, bureaucratic incompetence, or poor Western advice, I conclude that from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a   cabal    who used democracy for decoration rather than direction.” Mr. Comey, is it fair to say that the line that exists in the United States between government officers and government officials, is blurred in Russia? That there may be oligarchs or other individuals who on the surface appear to be private citizens, but who have connections to this   cabal who might be agents of influence or might be doing the Kremlin’s bidding in contact with others? COMEY: That’s fair to say and one of our counterintelligence missions is to try to understand who are those people and are they acting on behalf of the Russian government, those Russian citizens. HIMES: Is it generally true that there is a category of Russian oligarchs that are likely part of this   cabal? COMEY: In a general sense. HIMES: And if they go way back with Vladimir Putin, do the chances increase that they might be connected with the KGB, as is asserted by Professor Dawisha? COMEY: The longevity of the association can be a consideration. HIMES: And the KGB was the Russian intelligence service under the Soviet Union, right? COMEY: Correct, former. .. HIMES: And the Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union? COMEY: Correct. HIMES: Right. I’ll just observe, Renault Akhmetov, a steel and iron (ph) or a magnate or oligarch, is the richest man in Ukraine and a strong Putin ally. He was the one who reportedly recommended Paul Manafort to Yanukovych. Mr. Comey, last set of questions from me, I have a report that appeared in CNN yesterday. The headline is, ”Former Trump Campaign Chief Paul Manafort Wanted for Questioning in Ukraine Corruption Case.” And I    I raise this with you because the story is told of Paul Manafort acting on behalf of Ukraine’s former justice miniature    minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych, which who was the justice minister under the previous   regime who    and I’ll just read a segment from the story here. Who was involved in jailing the former Prime Minister Tymoshenko who was the main political rival of the Kremlin backed President Viktor Yanukovych who Manafort advised until he was deposed in 2014. Tymoshenko was released from jail at the same time that Yanukovych was ousted. Many saw her sentencing as politically motivated by the   Russian government. In response to the deterioration international climate, Ukrainian prosecutors say Manafort drafted a public relations strategy that included hiring Skadden Arps, an American law firm, to review the Tymoshenko case. And show the conviction had a sound legal basis. The story goes on to talk about the transfer of over $1 million, potentially, illegally from Ukrainian coffers (ph) to Skadden Arps. And the reason I bring all this up with you is because the story also says and it appears to have been confirmed by the Department of Justice that the current Ukraine regime, hardly a friend of the Russians. And very much targeted by the Russians has made seven requests to the United States government’s    the United States government for assistance under the MLA treaty in securing the assistance of Paul Manafort as part of this on   case. And in fact, the story says that you were presented personally with a letter asking for that assistance. So my question Director Comey is, is that all true? Have you been asked to provide assistance to the current Ukrainian government with respect to Paul Manafort? And how do you intend to respond to that request? COMEY: It’s not something I can comment on. I can say generally, we have a very strong relationship and cooperation in the criminal and national security areas with our Ukrainian partners, but I can’t talk about the particular matter. HIMES: The story says that the DOJ confirmed that there have been requests for assistance on this matter. You can’t go as far as    as confirming that in fact there have been these requests made? COMEY: If they’ve done that, I would need them to do it again. I    I can’t comment on it. HIMES: OK. Well, I appreciate that and with that I will yield back the remainder of my time to the ranking member. SCHIFF: And I yield to Terri Sewell. SEWELL: Thank you Mr. Ranking Member. My questions this morning really revolve around the resignation of the former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Director Comey, much as been made about Russia’s historical interference with political elections around the world meant to cause discord and    and    and disunity especially in Western alliance’s. Does the FBI generally assume that Russian ambassadors to the United States like Ambassador Kislyak, are at least overtly, collecting intelligence on influential Americans, especially political leaders. COMEY: Ms. Sewell, that’s not something I can answer in an open setting. SEWELL: Am I right that in the    that in the Russian playbook    that it’s in the Russian playbook to use diplomats and business people and Russian intelligence officers, whether declared or not to, collect intelligence on influential Americans for the purpose of affecting U. S. policy? COMEY: I can answer as a general matter. Nation states that are adversaries of United States use traditional intelligence officers, sometimes used intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover, use people we call   (ph) maybe a private citizens, students, academics, business people, all manner of human beings can be used in a    in an intelligence collection operation. But I’m not gonna talk about the particular. SEWELL: Would someone like Ambassador Kislyak Play that type of role for Russia? COMEY: I can’t say here. SEWELL: The declassified January intelligence community assessment report that your agency helped to draft, the report that’s entitled assessing Russian activities and intentions in the recent U. S. elections specifically states that, quote, ”Since the Cold War, Russian intelligence efforts related to the United States elections have primarily focused on foreign intelligence collections that could help Russian leaders understand a new U. S. administration’s plans and priorities,” end quote. So knowing what we know about Russia’s efforts and the role of the Russian ambassador, Director Comey, would you be concerned if any one of your agents had a private meeting with the Russian ambassador? COMEY: If an FBI agent had a private meeting with a Russian government employee of any kind, it would be concerning and I assume by private, one that’s not disclosed or part of their operational activity, yes. SEWELL: That’s right. And would you expect that agent to report that meeting? COMEY: Yes. SEWELL: Admiral Rogers, similar question. If    would you be concerned if one of your intelligence officers had a private meeting with the Russian ambassador? And would you expect that intelligence officer to report that meeting? ROGERS: Disclosures of interactions with foreign governments is a requirement for all our employees to include myself, for example. SEWELL: I ask these questions because on at least four occasions that I can count, Mr. Flynn, a   general and a former intelligence officer, someone with influence over the U. S. policy and someone with knowledge of state secrets and the incoming national security advisor, communicated with and met with the Russian ambassador and failed to disclose it. So I ask you directors, if you wouldn’t stand for your own staff to do this, why should we, the American people accept Michael Flynn doing it? COMEY: Ms. Sewell, I’ll let Mike Rogers take it next but I    I don’t    I can’t speak to what the disclosure obligations are for other people in the government so it’s hard for me to answer that. I can answer and I answered, I hope accurately with respect to one of the FBI special agents. ROGERS: And I likewise would answer the same way in terms of the NSA. SEWELL: I yield back. .. NUNES: . .. gentleman’s time    gentleman’s time has expired. I’ll yield myself 15 minutes. Director Comey, you announced this morning that there’ll be an investigation into Trump associates possible and President Trump and anyone around the campaign and any association with the Russian government. If this committee or anyone else for that matter, someone from the public, comes with information to you about the Hillary Clinton campaign or their associates or someone from the Clinton Foundation, will you add that to your investigation? They have ties to Russian intelligence services, Russian agents, would that be something of interest to you? COMEY: People bring us information about what they think is improper unlawful activity of any kind, we will evaluate it. Not just in    not just in this context. Folks send us stuff all the time. They should keep going that. NUNES: Do you think it’s possible that the Russians would not be trying to infiltrate Hillary Clinton’s campaign, get information on Hillary Clinton and try to get to people that are around that campaign or the Clinton Foundation? COMEY: I’m not prepared to comment about the particular campaigns but the Russians in general are always trying to understand who the future leaders might be and what levers of influence there might be on them. NUNES: I just hope that if    if information does surface about the other campaigns, not even just Hillary Clinton’s but any other campaigns, that you would take that serious also if the Russians were trying to infiltrate those campaigns around them. COMEY: Of course we would. NUNES: OK. I yield to Mr. Conaway.               CONAWAY: Thanks, Chairman. Gentlemen, thanks for being here. Admiral Rogers, you’d mentioned analytic standards earlier in the conversation. Are those standards the same for all intelligence analysts across the various agencies? ROGERS: There’s a broad set of intelligence community promulgated standards for all of us and then there are specific issues associated, for example, with a particular authority that you’re using to collect the information in the first place. CONAWAY: So, gentleman, same thing your    your agency    your analysts would have I think similar type standards? COMEY: Correct. That’s one of the really good things that’s happened since   especially since 2004 is the adoption of a common set of tradecraft provisions. CONAWAY: So, on a CPA and we have generally astounded    generally accepted accounting standards which are promulgated across a variety of things. Are those same standards publicly promulgated as    but generally disseminated through all of your analysts, I would assume would have some sort of a test that they know those standards? ROGERS: I think the specifics of the IC promulgated standards are classified but I could take that one for the record. CONAWAY: When the IC attributes a hacking to a particular actor, you do that through generally forensic evidence. But when it comes to try to determine intent foreign leaders, can you walk us through how the NSA does that or the FBI does that? ROGERS: We assess the range of information that we’ve collect    collected in an attempt to generate understanding as to not only what has occurred, but part of the intelligence professional    profession is also trying to understand why, what was the intent. We’ll use the range of information we have available to us, while we’re primarily a single source organization. It’s one reason why organizations like CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, which take multiple sources try to put together a complete picture. So we’re just one component of a broader effort. CONAWAY: Director Comey, anything different than that? COMEY: No, it’s about putting together a puzzle. Sometimes from forensics alone, you can get a pretty good indication as to what they must be intending to accomplish, other times requires human sources and additional a signals intelligence to give you that sense. CONAWAY: So both you agree, though, it’s rarely a precise art    or a precise science of determining intent of any foreign leader. ROGERS: That’s correct. COMEY: All of intelligence work requires judgment. That’s at the at the center of it. ROGERS: But I will say in some cases, it’s a much clearer case than in others. There are some. .. (CROSSTALK) CONAWAY: It depends on the sources you have inside a particular foreign leader’s shop. ROGERS: I’m not going to get into specifics. CONAWAY: Just in general. If you have somebody whose next door neighbor    never mind. Pivoting to the January 7    January 6 intelligence community assessment, both your agencies agree with the assessment that the Russian’s goal was to undermine the public faith in U. S. democratic process. Is that still your assessments? COMEY: Yes. ROGERS: Yes. CONAWAY: Same assessment said that the Russian’s goal was to    wanted to denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency and that Putin wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he publicly blamed her since 2011 for insighting mass protests against his regime in late 2011, early 2012. You both still agree with that assessment? COMEY: Yes. ROGERS: Yes. CONAWAY: And then finally, Admiral Rogers, that assessment went on to say that president Putin and the Russian government aspired to help president    I guess he would have been candidate Trump at the time    but   Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton. You had a lower. .. ROGERS: Confidence level. CONAWAY: . .. confidence level. Is that still the case? ROGERS: Yes, sir. CONAWAY: Can you tell the group why you were. .. ROGERS: I’m not going to get into specifics in an unclassified forum but for me, it boiled down to the level and nature of the sourcing on that one particular judgment was slightly different to me than the others. COMEY: To be clear, Mr. Conaway, we all agreed with that judgment. ROGERS: We all agreed with the judgment. CONAWAY: Right, right, right. But you really agreed and he almost really agreed. COMEY: Not term out folks use, but I. .. (CROSSTALK) CONAWAY: Director Comey, in terms of laying out those three assessment and whether or not the IC was consistent in its view of those three assessments across the entire campaign. And we walked through kind of the FBI’s walk down that path. Did    as of early December of ’16, did the FBI assess that the active measures were to undermine    by the Russians were to undermine the faith in U. S. Democratic process as you come to that conclusion by early December? COMEY: I think that’s right, December of last year. CONAWAY: Sixteen, yes sir. COMEY: I think we’re at that point, yes. CONAWAY: And then active measures conducted against Secretary Clinton, to denigrate her, hurt her campaign and also undermined her presidency? COMEY: Correct. CONAWAY: All right. And then, the conclusion that active measures were taken specifically to help President Trump’s campaign, you had that    by early December, you already had that conclusion? COMEY: Correct, that they wanted to hurt our democracy, hurt her, help him. I think all three we were confident in, at least as early as December. CONAWAY: OK. The    the paragraph that gives me a little concern there, in terms of just the timing of when all of that occurred because I’m not sure if we went back and got that exact same January assessment six months earlier, it would’ve looked the same. Because, you say, when we further assessed Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for   Trump. Any idea when that clear preference in the analysis, when did that get into the lexicon of whether you talk back and forth among yourselves on a    on a classified basis? COMEY: I don’t know for sure, but I think that was a fairly easy judgment for the community. He    Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much, that the flipside of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much. CONAWAY: Yeah and that and that my work on Saturday afternoon when the    my wife’s Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns. She really likes the Red Raiders. But all the rest of the time, I mean the logic is that because he really didn’t like president    the Candidate Clinton, that he automatically liked Trump. That assessment’s based on what? COMEY: Well, it’s based on more than that. But part of it is and we’re not getting into the details of it here, but part of it is the logic. Whoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win, by definition, you want their opponent to lose. CONAWAY: I know, but this says that    that you wanted both of them    you wanted her to lose and wanted him to win. Is that what you were saying? COMEY: Right, they’re inseparable    right, it’s a two    it’s a two person. .. CONAWAY: Right, right. COMEY: . .. event. CONAWAY: I got you. So I’m just wondering when you decided you wanted him to win? COMEY: Well, logically when he wanted her to lose, wanted. .. CONAWAY: No, no, no, I’m not talking about him, Putin, I got that. I got that. But the question is, we’re on this clear    well let me finish up then. So we go through that sentence about the clear preference for Donald Trump. And we don’t know exactly when you guys decided that was the case. Then it says, when it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency. So    and then election then says, the government    the Russian government aspired to help   Trump election chances. So when did they not think she was going to win? COMEY: Well, the assessment of the Intelligence Committee was, as the summer went on and the polls appeared to show that Secretary Clinton was gonna win, the Russians sort of gave up and simply focused on trying to undermine her, it’s your Red Raiders, you know they’re not going to win. So you kind of hope key people on the other team get hurt so they’re not such a tough opponent down the road. And so there was at some point. .. (CROSSTALK) CONAWAY: Sir, do you believe that the FBI was consistent through early December and on that that was the case. That they    they assessed that they really wanted Trump to win it and were working to help him win and her lose. COMEY: Yes, our analysts had a view that I don’t believe changed, from late fall through to the report on January 6 that it had those three elements. CONAWAY: All right. So then on December the 9th, well in advance of the January 6th deal, the    the Washington Post, put out an article. Their least sentence was that this    and again, CIA, they’re not here today but we’ll hopefully have them next week, concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the ’16 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency rather than to undermine the confidence in the electoral system. Rather than just undermine it, they don’t mention Mrs. Clinton at all. And then it says to help Trump elected, the U. S. senior briefed on the intelligence position    that the U. S.    that U. S. official briefed by    briefed on intelligence presentation to U. S. Senators said that’s the consensus view. How much did it    this is written by name Adam Intas Elaine (ph) something and Greg Miller. Do they have drafted you last    the January 6th document for the Intel Committee. COMEY: I’m sorry. CONAWAY: Did those writers from the Washington Post help you write the January 6 assessment? COMEY: No, they did not. CONAWAY: I wonder how they got almost the exact language on December the 9th. COMEY: It hadn’t been written yet. I don’t know. This is the peril of trying to comment on newspaper articles that report to report classified information. I can’t say much about them, they’re often wrong. CONAWAY: You mentioned earlier in one of our hearings that when anybody uses    the I can’t talk because I’m bound by position anonymity or whatever, that really is code for breaking the law generally, right? When somebody says I’m talking to a reporter, I’m declassifying secret information, you can’t tell    the reporter can’t tell who it is because, as Mr. Gowdy was saying earlier, speaking on condition of anonymity. That really should be interpreted because I’m breaking the law and I don’t want to be ousted. It that a fair statement? COMEY: Sometimes. I think there are other motives behind people requesting anonymity but that can be one of them. CONAWAY: So it’s you’re statement to us then that the FBI was consistent in it’s assessment that they integrate the U. S. electoral process, hurt Hillary and her potential and current across all of that across all of that, that they intended to help Trump, that’s your testimony this morning? COMEY: Correct. CONAWAY: Thank you. I yield back. NUNES: Mr. King? KING: Thank you Mr. Chairman. If you could yield me a few minutes into the next round    I’ll just start with this    make the comment. First of all, let me thank Director Comey and Admiral Rogers for being here today. And for what I believe it’s been the cooperative you’ve always given this committee. So thank you very much for that, for your service. Director Comey, I think we’re in a predicament here today. I understand your situation where you can’t comment on the investigation. And yet we’ve can have various scenarios laid out which can go on for months and months and months without anyone be able to disprove them until the investigation is completed. I just like to use the example, for instance we could’ve said that in 2012 President Obama was overheard on microphone telling Medvedev that I’m reelected, tell Vladimir we can work out better arrangements. We know that he ridiculed candidate Romney in the 2012 election when Romney said that he thought Russia still a threat. And then in 2013 we saw that basically President Obama invited the Russians into Syria when they’ve been pretty much removed from the Middle East 40 years before. And also as far as aid to Ukraine, far as I recall, the Obama administration always refuse to give the lethal aid to Ukraine and it can be argued that the Republican platform in 2016 was actually stronger than the Democratic platform on that. So again if we    if there was investigation going on with the Obama administration, we can lay out all these scenarios and say well that proves something or it might prove something. Until the investigation was completed, that type of almost possibly slanderous comments could be made. So I would just, again, if    I’m not asking you to hurry the investigation along, you have to do what you have to do. But I guess I could ask you just in the remaining moments I have in this round, I know that    I guess it was just two weeks ago that Director Clapper said that as far as he knows, all the evidence he’s seen, there’s no evidence of any collusion at all between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Now obviously a detailed, exhaustive report was put out talking about Russian influence in the campaign along with the intelligence apparatus had input into that. Do either you or Admiral Rogers have any reason to disagree with the conclusion of General Clapper that there’s no evidence of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. COMEY: Mr. King, it’s not something I can comment on. ROGERS: Likewise, I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation’s conclusions. KING: But again, you’re not going to disagree with General Clapper, you’re just not going to comment. And the reason I’m pointing that out is, that’s sort of the situation, you know, the other way around that you can’t comment on something, often there’s inference out there that because a person’s name is brought up, because he may have worked with somebody at a certain time, that there’s a guilt implied in that so that’s one problem. I’m not in any way being critical of either of you, I’m just saying this is a situation I think can be damaging to the country and does advance the Russian interest of trying to destabilize democracy and cause a lack of confidence in our system. And with that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. I recognize Mr. Schiff for 15 minutes. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple of   questions before I pass to Representative Sewell. It wasn’t simply that the Russians had a negative preference against Secretary Clinton, they also had a positive preference for Donald Trump, isn’t that correct? COMEY: Correct. SCHIFF: And I won’t ask you to say whether this is an accurate characterization of Mr. Trump, I won’t put you in that spot, but would it be logical for the Kremlin to prefer a candidate that disparaged NATO to be president of the United States? COMEY: You’re not going to put me in that spot, you said? SCHIFF: Yes. (LAUGHTER) COMEY: I’m happy with that. I’m happy with that. SCHIFF: I’m not going to put you in the spot of answering whether this is an accurate characterization of Mr. Trump’s views, but it would be logical for the Kremlin to want someone who had a dim view of NATO. Is that right? COMEY: All kidding aside, I don’t think that’s something I should be answering. That’s beyond my responsibilities. SCHIFF: Well, what is the Russian view of NATO. Do they like NATO? Do they want to see NATO strong? COMEY: Again, I’m sure you have already spoken to people who are greater experts than I but yes, they don’t like NATO. They think NATO encircles them and threatens them. SCHIFF: And would they have a preference for a candidate that expressed an openness to repealing the sanctions over Ukraine? COMEY: Again, I don’t want to get into business of commenting on that. I know. .. SCHIFF: Then let me ask you this way, Director. Would they like to see the sanctions on Ukraine go away? COMEY: Yes. SCHIFF: Would they have a preference for a candidate who expressed open admiration for Putin? COMEY: Can I help you reformulate the question? Mr. Putin would like people who like him. SCHIFF: Would they have a preference for a candidate who encouraged Brexit and other departures from Europe? Would they like to see more Brexits? COMEY: Yes. SCHIFF: And have the Russians in Europe demonstrated a preference for business people as political leaders with the hope that they can entangle them in financial interests or that they may allow their financial interests to take precedence over the interests of the countries in Europe they represent? COMEY: In our joint report, we recount that the Russians    that President Putin has expressed a preference for business leaders in leading other governments and mentions Gerhard Schroder and    I’m going to forget one. Berlusconi because he believes they’re people that are more open to negotiation, easier to deal with. SCHIFF: At this point, let me yield to Representative Sewell. SEWELL: I’d like to continue my questioning    the line of questioning on Michael Flynn. I’m sure you can understand my concern that Mr. Flynn not only failed to disclose the contacts with the Russian ambassador, but he said he did not remember whether he discussed sanctions against Russia with that ambassador and I find that really hard to believe. And wouldn’t you think that at the height of our concern about Russian hacking, that Mr. Flynn would have remembered meeting with the Russian ambassador and would have been    would have told him to stop meddling in our affairs, but that didn’t happen, did it? COMEY: Mrs. Sewell, that’s not something I can answer. SEWELL: Not only did Mr. Flynn not remember talking to the Russian ambassador and not only did he not remember what they talked about, he also appeared to have lied to Vice   Mike Pence all about it. Now, Mr. Comey, do you think that Mr. Flynn’s failure to disclose the communication and contact he had with the Russian ambassador and their topic of conversation along with a blatant lie to Vice President Pence meet the standard for an investigation by the FBI? COMEY: I have to give you the same answer, I’m not going to comment. SEWELL: Now, I know, Director Comey, that you probably can’t comment on this as well but I think it’s really important that we review a short timeline and    that’s based on press reportings because we need to get this for the public record, I think. So on December 25, 2016, Mr. Flynn reportedly exchanged text messages with the Russian ambassador. On December 28, 2016, Mr. Flynn reportedly spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador. By then, it was pretty clear that the Obama administration was going to take actions against Russia. On December 29, 2016, Mr. Flynn reportedly spoke on the phone with the Russian ambassador again. That day, the Obama administration expelled 35 Russian operatives from the United States and announced new sanctions. We also know from press reportings that sometime in December, Mr. Flynn met in person with the Russian ambassador at Trump Tower and that Mr. Trump’s     Jared Kushner was also there. The purpose of the meeting was to quote ”Establish a line of communication” end quote, with the Kremlin. I should add that the White House and Mr. Flynn didn’t disclose this December    meeting until this month. On January 20    January 12, sorry    2017, press reported that Mr. Flynn contacted the Russian ambassador again. And on January 15, 2015 vice   Mike Pence stated on several Sunday morning shows regarding Mr. Flynn’s conversation with ambassador quote, ”What I can confirm, having spoken to him about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions,” end quote. On January 26, the    the acting Attorney General, Sally Yates reportedly told president Trump’s White House counsel, who immediately told President Trump that Mr. Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail because of discrepancies between Vice   Pence’s public statement and Mr. Flynn’s actual discussions. On February 10, President Trump denied knowledge of this, telling reporters on Air Force One, quote, ”I don’t know about that,” end quote, in response to questions about Mr. Flynn’s conduct. The White House also publicly denied that Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador discussed sanctions. And of course on February 13, 2017, Mr. Flynn resigned as national security advisor. Now, Director Comey, all of these accounts are open source press reportings. Given Russian’s   desire to cultivate relations with influential U. S. persons, isn’t the American public right to be concerned about Mr.    Mr. Flynn’s conduct, his failure to disclose that contact with the Russian ambassador, his attempts to cover it up and what looks like the White House’s attempts to sweep this under the rug. Don’t we, as the American people, deserve the right to know and shouldn’t our FBI investigate such claims? COMEY: I can’t comment. I    I understand people’s curiosity about our work and intense interest in it, and as Mr. King said, oftentimes, speculation about it. But we can’t do it well or fairly to the people we investigate if we talk about it. So I can’t comment. SEWELL: I’d like to turn to another topic about Mr. Flynn, his failure to disclose until pressured last week, by my colleagues on the House Oversight and Government Relations Committee, Government Reforms Committee, payments he received from Russia for his 2015 trip to the 10th anniversary Gala of RT, the Russian owned propaganda media outlet. According to the January 2017 declassified IC assessment report, RT’s criticism of the United States was quote, ”The last facet of its broader and    . S. messaging likely aimed at undermining viewer’s trust in the U. S. Democratic procedures,” end quote. This January assessment points out that this was a strategy that Russia employed, going back to before, the 2012 elections, according to the IC assessment. So Admiral Rogers, am I right that the RT is essentially owned by the Russian government? And how long has the intelligence community been looking at RT as an arm of the Russian government? ROGERS: So we’re certainly aware and have been for some period of time of the direct connections between Russian government and RT individuals, we’re aware of monetary flow and other things. We have been. .. (CROSSTALK) SEWELL: And how long have you known about that, a few months, a few years, I mean how long has the United States. .. (CROSSTALK) ROGERS: Some number of years, I apologize ma’am, I just don’t know off the top of my head. SEWELL: Aren’t I right to assume then, that the former Director of DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency Mr. Flynn, would have been aware that RT’s role as an  . S. Russian propaganda outlet when he agreed to speak at their anniversary Gala in 2015. Isn’t it reasonable to assume that he would know? ROGERS: I’m not in a position to comment on the knowledge of something else from another person, ma’am. SEWELL: Director Comey, would be unusual for a foreign government official to be    to get paid by a foreign adversary to attend such an event? And would it be unusual and raise some questions at the FBI, if that person failed to disclose the payments received for that trip? COMEY: I don’t know in general and as to the specific, I’m    I’m just not gonna comment. SEWELL: Yes, sir. I understand that you can’t comment. But I’d like to read an exchange between Mr. Flynn and a Yahoo news correspondent from July 2016 regarding his trip to Russia, during the RT event. The correspondent asked, ”Were you paid for that event?” Then, there was back and forth for a bit. And then Mr. Flynn said, quote, ”Yeah. I didn’t take any money from Russia if that’s what you’re asking me,” end quote. So Director Comey, isn’t it true that the House Oversight Committee last week, received information and released publicly that Mr. Flynn accepted nearly $35, 000 in speaking fees and traveling fees from RT, this government    Russian government owned media outlet. COMEY: I believe I’ve seen news accounts to that effect. SEWELL: Moreover, isn’t it also true that according to the emoluments clause of the United States Constitution, a person holding any office of profit or trust cannot accept gifts or payments from a foreign    from a foreign country. And doesn’t the DOD, the Department of Defense prohibit retired military officers from taking any consulting fees, gifts, traveling expenses, honorariums, a salary from a foreign government, including commercial enterprises owned by or controlled by a foreign government like RT? COMEY: That’s not something I can comment on. SEWELL: Can you    can you speak to whether or not the emoluments clause would apply to someone like Mr. Flynn, a retired   general? COMEY: I can’t. SEWELL: So isn’t is    I just find be really hard to believe that given the emoluments clause does apply to retired officers like Mr. Flynn. I can’t believe that Mr. Flynn, a retired military officer would take money from the Russian government in violation of the United State Constitution. And I believe that such violations worthy of a criminal investigation by the FBI. What level of proof do we need in order for us to have a criminal investigation by the FBI of Mr. Flynn? COMEY: I can’t comment on that. SEWELL: Shouldn’t the American people be concerned what    I think that it’s really hard for us to fathom that he wouldn’t know that he should’ve disclosed that he received $30, 000 as a part of    of a speaking engagement to RT, the Russian U. S.   outlet. COMEY: I can’t comment on that Ms. Sewell. SEWELL: My final line of questioning is in regard to Mr. Flynn working as an agent of a foreign power. Now Director Comey, following on Mr. Himes’s line of questioning, am I correct that the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires that individuals who lobby on behalf of a foreign government must register with the United States government? COMEY: I believe that’s correct. I know keep saying I’m not an expert. The reason I’m saying that is, I don’t know exactly how they define things like lobbying in the statute. But as a general matter, if you’re going to represent a foreign government here in the United States, touching our government, you should be registered. SEWELL: And isn’t it true that just last November 2016, Mr. Flynn was working as a foreign agent doing work that principally benefited the government of Turkey and yet reported until just last week? COMEY: I can’t comment on that. SEWELL: Isn’t it true that Mr. Flynn was reportedly paid over half $1 million for this work? COMEY: Same answer. SEWELL: And isn’t it true that the Trump White House, on at least two occasions, was asked by Mr. Flynn’s lawyers whether he should report that work, the work that he was doing on behalf of the Turkish government. And yet the administration didn’t give him any advice to the contrary. Do you know anything about that? COMEY: I have to give you the same answer. SEWELL: So Director Comey, I know you I cannot discuss whether any investigations are ongoing with U. S. persons, and I respect that. I think it’s important though that the American people understand the scope and breath of what, in public open source press reportings of Mr. Flynn’s actions that led to his resignation. And while we can’t talk about whether there are an investigation, I believe that we here at HPSCI, at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence must put those facts into the public domain. And they are one, that Mr. Flynn lied about his communication with the    with the Russian ambassador. Secondly, That Mr. Flynn lied about taking money from the Russian government and thirdly, that Mr. Flynn at a minimum did not disclose work as an agent of a foreign    of a foreign power and that the White House did not help in this concern. So gentlemen, it’s clear to me that Mr. Flynn should be under criminal investigation. And I know you cannot comment but I believe it is my duty as a member of this committee to comment to the American people that this    that his engagement of lying and failure to disclose really important information and contacts with a foreign ambassador do rise to the level of    of disclosure and to me, criminal intent. So I say this to say that the American people deserve to know the full extent of Mr. Flynn’s involvement with the Russians and the extent to which it influenced the 2016 election. I believe our democracy requires it. Thank you, I yield back to my ranking member. NUNES: Time’s expired. Recognize myself for 15 minutes. Mr. Comey and Mr. Rogers, you both said that the Russians had    they favored Donald Trump, the selection. And you made that change, from the beginning of December it was not that they were trying to help Donald Trump, but that changed by early January. Mr. Conaway talked about that. Do    do Russians. .. COMEY: I don’t    I don’t agree with that. I want to make sure I didn’t misspeak earlier. We didn’t change our view from December to early January. We, the FBI    and I don’t know that anybody else did on the I. C. team. ROGERS: Me, from my perspective, we didn’t have a fully formed view until the end of December. .. NUNES: At some point    at some point, the assessment    at some point, the assessment changed from    from going from just trying to hurt Hillary Clinton to no, that they were actually trying to help Donald Trump get elected. That was early December as far as I know and then by January, you had all changed your mind on that. COMEY: Well that’s not my recollection. ROGERS: That’s not my recollection either, sir. NUNES: OK. So is it    do Russians historically prefer Republicans to win over Democrats? COMEY: I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t know the answer to that. NUNES: Did the Russians prefer Mitt Romney over Barack Obama in 2012? ROGERS: I don’t know that we ever did    drew a formal analytic conclusion. NUNES: Did the Russians prefer John McCain in 2008 over Barack Obama? ROGERS: I never saw a U. S. intelligence community analytic position on that issue. NUNES: Don’t you think it’s ridiculous to say that    for anyone to say that the Russians prefer Republicans over Democrats? ROGERS: I didn’t think that that’s what you just heard us say, I apologize, sir. COMEY: I hope you didn’t hear us to say that. We don’t know in those particular races and I’m not qualified enough. .. NUNES: I’m just asking a general question. Wouldn’t it be a little preposterous to say that historically, going back to Ronald Reagan and all that we know about maybe who the Russians would prefer, that somehow the Russians prefer Republicans over Democrats? COMEY: There is    I’m not going to discuss in an unclassed forum, in the classified segment of the reporting version that we did, there is some analysis that discusses this because remember this did come up in our assessment on the Russian piece. I’m not going to discuss this unclassified forum. NUNES: Mr.    Mr. King. KING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would just say on that because again, we’re not going into the classified sections, that indicating that historically Russians have supported Republicans, and I know that language is there, to me puts somewhat of a cloud over the entire report. It seems to indicate the direction it was going in, but anyway, let me just say this for the record, and I know what your answer’s going to be, but I have to get this statement on the record. On March 15, former acting director of CIA, Mike Morell, who was the acting director under President Obama and put on the record I’ve had differences with Mike Morell in the past but he was asked about the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians and his answer was there’s smoke but there is not fire at all. There’s no little camp fire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark. COMEY: I can’t comment, Mr. King. KING: Admiral Rogers. ROGERS: I’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation. KING: I understand that. That was my way of getting on the record, so I appreciate that. You were talking about the significance of leaks and how important it is we stop them. And to me    and I’ve been here a while    I’ve never seen such a sustained period of leaks. Going back to December where, not the Intelligence Committee, but the Washington Post was told the conclusion of the report    a similar one    what it was going to be. We have situations in the New York Times where they talk of meetings, they talk about transcripts, they talk about conversations. There was one in particular that spoke about Trump campaign individuals meeting with Russian intelligence agents and again, Director Comey, I don’t know if you can comment on this, but the White House chief of staff, said against that day, on the next day that Mr. McCabe from your office you went to him at the White House and told him that that story was BS. Is there any way you can comment on whether or not Mr. McCabe told that to Mr. Priebus? COMEY: I can’t, Mr. King, but I can agree with your general premise. Leaks have always been a problem. I read over the weekend something from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln complaining about them. But I do think in the last six weeks, couple of months, there’s been at least    apparently a lot of conversation about classified matters that’s ending up in the media. Now, a lot of it is just dead wrong, which is one of the challenges because we don’t correct it, but it does strike me there’s been a lot of people talking or at least reporters saying people are talking to them in ways that have struck me as unusually active. KING: I fully understand the media’s fascination with palace intrigue, with which faction of the White House is trying to outdo the other, that’s all    to me, that’s all legitimate, that goes with the game. But if you’re talking about leaking classified information, if you’re talking about leaking investigations, I mean    you’ve stated today that there is an FBI investigation going on. So if the New York Times can be believed, I would think there would have to be somebody from the FBI who is telling them about these purported meetings, which Mr. McCabe said was BS, with the Russian intelligence agencies. Somebody who’s familiar with that investigation spoke to the New York Times. And so I’ll use that as an example and also, one where there’s a small universe. I think it was on January 6, when yourself, Admiral Rogers, Director Brennan, and General Clapper went to Trump tower to meet with President Trump. The media reports are that at the end of that meeting, Director Comey, you presented   Trump with a copy of the now infamous or famous dossier. And I don’t know how many people were in the room, but within hours, that was leaked to the media and that gave the media the excuse or the rationale to publish almost the entire dossier. Do you    does that violate any law? I mean you were at a classified briefing with the   of the United States and it had to be a very, very small universe of people who knew that you handed them that dossier and it was leaked out within hours. Are you making any effort to find out who leaked it and do you believe that constitute a criminal violation? COMEY: I can’t say, Mr. King except I can answer in general. KING: Yes. COMEY: Any unauthorized disclosure of classified conversations or documents is potentially a violation of law and a serious, serious problem. I’ve spent most of my career trying to figure out unauthorized disclosures and where they came from. It’s very, very hard. Often times, it doesn’t come from the people who actually know the secrets. It comes from one hop out, people who heard about it or were told about it. And that’s the reason so much information that reports to be accurate classified information is actually wrong in the media. Because the people who heard about it didn’t hear about it right. But, it is an enormous problem whenever you find information that is actually classified in the media. We don’t talk about it because we don’t wanna confirm it, but I do think it should be investigated aggressively and if possible, prosecuted so people take as a lesson, this is not OK. This behavior can be deterred and its deterred by locking some people up who have engaged in criminal activity. KING: Well, could you say it was    obviously, Admiral Rogers was in the room, you were in the room, General Clapper was in the room and Director Brennan was in the room. Were there any other people in the room that could’ve leaked that out? I mean this isn’t a report that was circulated among 20 people. This is an unmasking of names where you may have 20 people in the NSA and a hundred people in the FBI, its not putting together a report or the intelligence agency. This is four people in a room with the   of the United States. And I don’t know who else was in that room and that was leaked out, it seemed within minutes or hours, of you handing him that dossier and it was so confidential, if you read the media reports that you actually handed it to him separately. So believe me, I’m not saying it was you. I’m just saying, it’s a small universe of people that would’ve known about that. And if it is a disclosure of classified information, if you’re going to start with investigating the leaks, to me that would be one place where you could really start to narrow it down. COMEY: And again, Mr. King, I can’t comment because I do not ever wanna confirm a classified conversation with a president or  . I can tell you my general experience. It often turns out, there are more people who know about something you expected. At first, both because there may be more people involved in the thing than you realized, not    not this particular, but in general. And more people have been told about it or heard about it or staff have been briefed on it. And those echoes are in my experience, what most often ends up being shared with reporters. KING: Well, could you tell us who else was in the room that day? COMEY: I’m sorry? KING: Could you tell us who else was in the room with you that day? COMEY: No, because I’m not going to confirm that there was such a conversation because then, I might accidentally confirm something that was in the newspaper. KING: But could you tell us who was in the room, whether or not there was a conversation? COMEY: No, I’m not confirming there was a conversation. In a classified setting, I might be able to share more with you, but I’m not going to confirm any conversations with either President Obama or President Trump or when President Trump was the  . KING: Well, not the conversation or even the fact that you gave it to him, but can you    can you tell us who was in the room for that briefing that you gave? COMEY: That you’re saying later ended up in the newspaper? KING: Yes. COMEY: So my talking about who was in the room would be a confirmation that was in the newspaper was classified information, I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to help people who did something that    that is unauthorized. KING: Yeah, but we all know that the four of you went to Trump Tower for the briefing, I mean that’s not classified, is it? COMEY: How do we all know that, though? KING: OK. (LAUGHTER) COMEY: Yeah. KING: You know, you can    you see the predicament we’re in, here. COMEY: I get it. I get it. But we are   to protect classified information, both in the first when we get it, and then to make sure we don’t accidentally jeopardize classified information by what we say about something that appears in the media. KING: Well, if they’re listening, I would just advise that Director Clapper and Director Brennan, we’ll be asking them the same questions last week    next week and perhaps, they can give us some answers. Mr. Chairman, I    I yield back. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. .. (CROSSTALK) KING: Thank you. Thank you for testifying. NUNES: Mr. Lobiondo is recognized. LOBIONDO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Comey, Admiral Rogers, thank you for your service and thank you for being here. Understanding that what both of you have been saying about the classified nature of the investigation, the classified nature of the topics we’re talking about, can you give us any indication of when we, the committee, may in a classified setting know something from you. Would we have ongoing updates? COMEY: Mr. LoBiondo, I don’t know how long the work will take. I can’t commit to updates, as you know. I have briefed the committee as a whole on some aspects of our work and I’ve briefed in great detail the chair and the ranking. I don’t know    I can’t    I can’t predict or commit to updates. But as your work goes on, we’re in constant touch with you and we’ll do the best we can, but I can’t commit to that as I sit here. LOBIONDO: So as the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are conducting our bipartisan investigations and looking wherever it may lead with individuals or circumstances. If you, through the FBI investigation, come across a circumstance with an individual or a situation would we be made aware of that under normal course of business? COMEY: Not necessarily, but it’s possible. LOBIONDO: OK. So can you, either Director Comey or Admiral Rogers, tell us what we are doing or what we should be doing to protect against Russian interference in future elections or any meddling with our government or for that matter any state sponsor Iranians, North Koreans, Chinese, with any    any meddling they may be doing? ROGERS: So first, I think a public discussion and acknowledgment of the activity is a good positive first step because it shines us a flashlight on this, if you will. It illuminates a significant issue that I think we all have to    have to deal with. There’s a variety ongoing efforts both within the government, as well, in the private sector. In terms of how we harden our defenses, I think we also need to have a discussion about just what for example, does critical infrastructure meeting in the  . I don’t think we traditionally would have thought of an election infrastructure as critical. We traditionally viewed critical infrastructure as something that generated an industrial output, aviation, electricity, finance, I don’t think we’ve traditionally thought about it and informational kind of dynamic. I think that’s a challenge for us coming ahead and then continued partnership between the elements within the government, as well is in the private sector, that’s the key to the future to me. LOBIONDO: So just for the record, I also had a whole list of specific questions about individuals   circumstances that don’t want to be repetitive and have you say, I can’t comment on them. But I would anticipate when we move to classified session that this committee will be able to explore some of those    some of the situations in a little more depth. I have a couple of other questions about the    about the    the Russian intervention. But I don’t have enough time to get into it right now. Mr. Chairman, if you could give me a couple minutes when we get to the next round. NUNES: ( ) LOBIONDO: OK. So very briefly the    if you can describe the elements of the Russia’s active measures in the campaign in the 2016 election. We’ve only got 35 seconds, but that’s the first thing I want to get into about exactly what they were doing if you can tell us anything about that. ROGERS: So we saw cyber used, we saw the use of external media, we saw the use of disinformation, we saw the use of leaking of information, much of which was not altered. I mean, we saw several, if you will, common traits that we have both seen over time as well as I would argue that the difference this time was that the    the cyber dimension and the fact that the release of so much information that they had extracted via cyber is a primary tool to try to drive an outcome. LOBIONDO: So in this setting, can you talk to us at all about what tools they used? ROGERS: I’m not going to go into the specifics of how they executed the hacks. I apologize, no sir. LOBIONDO: We’ll try to get into that in classified. I’ll hold off for now, thank you. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Schiff’s recognized for 15 minutes. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a couple   questions. Director Comey, can you tell me what an SF86 is? COMEY: SF86? SCHIFF: Yes. COMEY: It’s the standard background clearance form that all of us who are hired by the federal government and want to have access to classified information fill out. SCHIFF: Would someone who is an incoming national security advisor have to fill out an SF86? COMEY: Yes, I think so. SCHIFF: Would that SF86 require that the applicant disclose any payments received from a foreign power? COMEY: I think so. I mean, the form is the form. I think so and foreign travel as well. SCHIFF: I’d make a request through you to the Justice Department or whatever IC component would have custody of Mr. Flynn’s SF86, I’d make a request that that be provided to the committee. And I yield now to Mr. Carson. CARSON: Thank you, Ranking Member. I’d like to focus my line of questioning on Russia’s views toward Ukraine. In March 2014, Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea beginning a conflict which has effectively yet to be resolved. Admiral Rogers, can you please briefly describe, as you understand it, sir, how Russia took Crimea? ROGERS: I would argue the insertion of military force. They occupied it and physically removed it from Ukrainian control. CARSON: Sir, we’ve heard terms like little green men and hybrid warfare. Can you please explain how these relate to Russia and Ukraine? ROGERS: So on the Ukraine side, what we saw was over time, rather than the kind of overt kind of activity we saw to such a degree on the Crimea side, what we saw was a much bigger effort on the influence and attempts to distance Russian actions from any potential blowback to the Russian state, if you will, and hence the use of the little green men surrogates in military    unmarked military uniforms, the flow of information, the provision of resources to support forcible separation of the Ukraine. CARSON: Admiral, has Russia returned Crimea back to Ukraine, sir? ROGERS: No. CARSON: Do they have intentions to? ROGERS: They publicly indicated that they will not. CARSON: Admiral, why does Russia even care about Ukraine? ROGERS: I’m sure in their view they view this is a primary national interest for them. It’s on the immediate periphery of the Russian state. CARSON: Am I right, sir, that they see it as a part of their broader objective to influence and impact Russia’s    Ukraine’s desire for  ? ROGERS: Yes. I think that’s part of it. CARSON: Sir, as Russia tried to claim stolen territory in Ukraine, the U. S. and the rest of the world saw the annexation for what it was; a crime. Shortly after Russia invaded, the United Nations essentially declared it a crime in a nonbinding resolution. In our own government, recognizing the seriousness of the event instituted new sanctions against Russia, is that right sir? ROGERS: Yes sir. CARSON: Now this was a time where much of the world was united but Russia invaded another country and illegally annexed it’s territory as we all stood    with Ukraine. Now one person who didn’t see it that way, however, was president Donald Trump. On July 30, in an interview with ABC News, Mr. Trump said of Putin, and I quote, ”He’s not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he’s not going into Ukraine, all right?” end quote. Now, Admiral, hadn’t Putin already gone into Ukraine two years before and hadn’t left? ROGERS: We’re talking about the Crimea and influence on the Ukraine generally, yes, sir. CARSON: And he still hasn’t left, correct, sir? ROGERS: Now we’re starting to get into some very technical questions about are the Russians physically in the Ukraine, is it surrogates that the Crimea is a very example of to me. They outright invaded with armed military force and have annexed it. CARSON: But are they effectively still in Ukraine? ROGERS: They’re certainly supporting the ongoing effort in the Ukraine to split that country. CARSON: We’ll get back to Mr. Trump in a minute. First, tell me sir, what would it mean to Russia and to Putin to have sanctions lifted? ROGERS: Clearly, even easing of economic impact, greater flexibility, more resources. CARSON: Now according to NATO analysis, the Russian economy shrunk by as much as 3. 5 percent in 2015 and had no growth in 2016 in big part because of western sanctions, especially those against the oil and gas industry. Now, we’re talking about a loss of over $135 billion just in the first year of sanctions. That’s a huge sum of money and sanctions aren’t meant to push their economy over a cliff, but to put   pressure on Putin to change his behavior. Putin, himself, said in 2016 that sanctions are severely harming Russia. So we know they’ve had success in putting pressure on the Kremlin. Admiral, what would it mean geopolitically? Would it help legitimate Russia’s illegal land grab? ROGERS: Sir, I’m not    I’m not in a position to talk broadly about the geopolitical implications. I mean we have stated previously, from an intelligence perspective, we tried to    we have tried to outline to policy makers the specifics of the Russian invasion on Crimea, the specifics of the continued Russian support to separatists in the Ukraine that Russians continue to    to pressure and the keep the Ukraine weak. CARSON: Would it help cleave the United States from her allies? ROGERS: If we remove the sanctions? CARSON: There’s a lot of steak    there’s a lot at stake here for Russia. This is big money, big strategic implications. If they can legitimate their annexation of Crimea, what’s next? Are we looking at a new iron curtain descending across Eastern Europe? You know, most in our country recognize what is at stake in how the United States, as the leader of the free world, is the only check on Russian expansion. So back to Mr. Trump and his cohort. At the republican convention in July, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Trump himself changed the republican party platform to no longer arm Ukraine. So the same month that Trump denied Putin’s role in Ukraine, his team weakened the party platform on Ukraine and as we have and will continue to hear, this was the same month that several individuals in the Trump orbit held secret meetings with Russian officials, some of which may have been on the topic of sanctions against Russia or their intervention in Ukraine. Now this is no coincidence in my opinion. In fact, the dossier written by former MI6 agent, Christopher Steele alleges that Trump agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue, which is effectively a priority for Vladimir Putin. There’s a lot in the dossier that is yet to be proven, but increasingly as we’ll hear throughout the day, allegations are checking out. And this one seems to be as accurate as they come. In fact, there is also one pattern I wanna point out before yielding back, Manafort, fired, Page, fired, Flynn, fired. Why? They were hired because of their Russian connections, they were fired. However, because their connections became public, they were effectively culpable. But they were also the fall guys. So I think after we hear Mr. Quigley’s line of questioning, we might guess who could be next. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, I yield back. SCHIFF: I yield the balance to Representative Speier. SPEIER: Thank you, Ranking Member. Thank you gentlemen for your service to our country. You know, I think it’s really important as we sit here that we explain this to the American people in a way that they can understand it. Why are we talking about all of this? So my first question to each of you is, is Russia our adversary? Mr. Comey? COMEY: Yes. SPEIER: Mr. Rogers? ROGERS: Yes. SPEIER: Is    do they intend to do us harm? ROGERS: They intend to ensure, I believe, that they gain advantage at our expense. SPEIER: Director Comey? COMEY: Yes, I wanna be    harm can have many meetings. They’re an adversary and so they wanna resist us, oppose us, undermine us, in lots of different ways. SPEIER: So one of the terms that we hear often is hybrid warfare. And I’d like to just stand give a short definition of what it is. It blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyber warfare. The aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution. So would you say that Russia engaged in hybrid warfare in its effort to undermine our Democratic process and engage in our electoral process? Director Comey? COMEY: I don’t think I would use the term warfare. I think you’d    you’d wanna ask experts in the definition of war. They engaged in a multifaceted campaign of active measures to undermine our democracy and hurt one of the candidates and    and hope to help one of the other candidates. ROGERS: I’d agree with the director. SPEIER: All right, well, thank you both. I actually think that their engagement was an act of war, an act of hybrid warfare and I think that’s why the American people should be concerned about it. Now, in    in terms of trying to understand this, I    I think of a spider web, with a tarantula in the middle. And the tarantula, in my view, is Vladimir Putin, who is entrapping many people to do his bidding and to engage with him. And I would include those like Roger Stone and Carter Page and Michael Caputo and Wilbur Ross and Paul Manafort and Rex Tillerson. I’d like to focus first on Rex Tillerson in the three minutes I have, here. He was the CEO of Exxon Mobil. In 2008, he said that the likelihood of U. S.  businesses was, in fact, a poor investment, that Russia was a poor investment climate, that was in 2008. In 2011 he closed the $500 billion deal with Rosneft Oil. The CEO of Rosneft is Igor Sechin, who is a confident of President Putin, second most powerful man in Russia and probably a former KGB agent. The deal gives Exxon access to the Black Sea and the Kara Seas and Siberia for oil development. Rosneft gets minority interest in Exxon in Texas and the Gulf. Rex Tillerson calls Sechin a good friend. In 2012, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Sechin go on a road show here in the United States to talk about this great deal that they had just consummated. Also in 2012 there’s a video of President Putin and Mr. Tillerson toasting champagne at the deal. And in 2013, Mr. Tillerson receives the Russian Order of Friendship and he sits right next to President Putin at the event. So my question to you Director Comey is, is it of value to President Putin knowing what you know of him and that his interest in doing harm to us, is it of benefit to Mr. Putin to have Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State? COMEY: I can’t answer that question. SPEIER: Admiral Rogers? ROGERS: Ma’am I’m not    I’m not in the position answer that question. SPEIER: All right. So in 2014 at Igor Sechin is sanctioned and he laments that he no longer will be able to come to the United States to motorcycle ride with Mr. Tillerson. Could you give me an understanding of what are some of the reasons that we impose sanctions, Direct Comey? COMEY: On Sechin? SPEIER: Well, just in general. COMEY: Again, you’d have to ask an expert, but from my general knowledge it’s to punish activities that are criminal in nature, that involve war crimes, that involve violations of U. N. resolutions or United States law in some other way, it’s to communicate and enforce foreign policy interests and values of United States of America. That’s my general sense, but an expert might describe it much better. SPEIER: Admiral Rogers? ROGERS: I would echo the Director’s comments. It’s also a tool that we use to attempt to drive and shake the choices and actions of others. SPEIER: So in the case of Igor’s session, who was sanctioned by the United States, in part to draw attention to the fact that Russia had invaded Crimea. It’s an effort to try and send a very strong message to Russia, is that not true? COMEY: I think that’s right. ROGERS: Yes ma’am. SPEIER: With that, Mr. Chairman, I’ll yield back for now. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. I’m going to yield myself 15 minutes and now yield to the general lady from Florida Ms.  .  : Thank you so much Mr. Chairman. It’s never acceptable, we can all agree, for any foreign power to interfere with our electoral process and this committee has long been focused on Russia’s reprehensible conduct. And we will remain focused on the threat emanating from Moscow. And I agree with you Director Comey, when you say this investigation that is ongoing, we will follow the facts wherever they lead on a bipartisan level and there will be no sacred cows. There are many important issues at stake, as you gentlemen have heard. There is bipartisan agreement on the danger of illegal leaks and our ability to reauthorize important programs upon which our intelligence community relies. But I want to assure the American people that there’s also bipartisan agreement on getting to the bottom of Russian meddling in our election which must remain the focus of this investigation and yours. So Admiral Rogers, I agree in what you said that a public acknowledgement of this foreign meddling to be a problem is important as we move forward. And following on Congressman LoBiondo’s questions and based on this theme, I’d like to ask you gentlemen if you could describe what, if anything, Russia did in this election that to your knowledge they did or they didn’t do in previous elections, how    how it was    were their actions different in this election than    than in previous ones. ROGERS: I’d say the biggest difference from my perspective was both the use of cyber, the hacking as a vehicle to physically gain access to information to extract that information and then to make it widely, publicly available without any alteration or change. COMEY: The only thing I’d add is they were unusually loud in their intervention. It’s almost as if they didn’t care that we knew what they were doing or that they wanted us to see what they were doing. It was very noisy, their intrusions in different institutions.  : And what specifically based on this loudness did the FBI or the NSA do to prevent or counter this Russian active measure that we read about in the intelligence community assessment? As loud as they were, what did we do to counter that? COMEY: Well, among other things, we alerted people who had been victims of intrusions to permit them to tighten their systems to see if they couldn’t kick the Russian actors out. We also, as a government, supplied information to all the states so they could equip themselves to make sure there was no successful effort to affect the vote and there was none, as we said earlier. And then the government as a whole in October called it out. And I believe it was Director Clapper and   Jeh Johnson issued a statement saying this is what the Russians are doing, sort of an inoculation.  : And the loudness to which you refer, perhaps they were doing these kinds of actions previously in other elections but they were not doing it as loudly. What    why do you think that they did not mind being loud and being found out? COMEY: I don’t know the answer for sure. I think part    their number one mission is to undermine the credibility of our entire democracy enterprise of this nation and so it might be that they wanted us to help them by telling people what they were doing. Their loudness, in a way, would be counting on us to amplify it by telling the American people what we saw and freaking people out about how the Russians might be undermining our elections successfully. And so that might have been part of their plan, I don’t know for sure. ROGERS: I’ve    I agree with Director Comey. I mean, a big difference to me in the past was while there was cyber activity, we never saw in previous presidential elections information being published on such a massive scale that had been illegally removed both from private individuals as well as organizations associated with the democratic process both inside the government and outside the government.  : And this massive amount and this loudness, now that it’s become public knowledge, now that we have perhaps satisfied their    their    their thirst that it has become such a huge deal, do you expect their interference to be amplified in future U. S. elections? Do you see any evidence of that in European elections or do you think that this public acknowledgment would    would tamper down the volatility? COMEY: I’ll let my    maybe I’ll just say as initial matter they’ll be back. And they’ll be in 2020, they may be back in 2018 and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sewed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process. It’s possible they’re misreading that as it worked and so we’ll come back and hit them again in 2020. I don’t know but we have to assume they’re coming back. ROGERS: I fully expect them to continue this    this level of activity because I    our sense is that they have come to the conclusion that it generated a positive outcome for them in the sense that calling into question the democratic process for example is one element of the strategy. We’re working closely, we    our FBI teammates, others working closely with our European teammates to provide the insights that we have seen to try to assist them as they, themselves, France and Germany for example, about to undergo significant national leadership elections over the course of the next two months.  : And in terms of the European elections, what    what have you seen or any information that you can share with us about the Russian interference in that process? ROGERS: So you see some of the same things that we saw in the U. S. in terms of disinformation, fake news, attempts to release of information to embarrass individuals, you’re seeing that play out to some extent in European elections right now.  : I look forward to continuing with you. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. NUNES: Gentlelady yields back. Mr. Turner is recognized. TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, Admiral Rogers, thank you for being here today and for your    what appears to be attempts at being forthcoming with the committee. I also want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member Schiff. This is a bipartisan effort. I think as you’ve looked to what this committee is undertaking, everyone wants answers and everyone want answers to all of the questions that are being asked because this does go to such an important issue concerning our elections. Admiral Rogers, I’m going to begin with a question to you concerning the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Now Admiral, as you know that the foreign service    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides the circumstances or the authority under which the intelligence community may collect or intercept the communication of a foreign person located outside of the United States, or as Mr. Comey’s indicated a person who is covered under a FISA court order. Now, with Mr. Rooney and Mr. Gowdy you discussed the minimization procedures under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and those minimization procedures are supposed to protect the privacy rights of U. S. citizens. Specifically, it’s geared toward the communications of those who maybe inadvertently or incidentally collected as a result of the intelligence community’s lawful collection of communications of others. So Mr. Rogers, is the intelligence community required to cease collection or the interception of communications if the result of the collection or interception includes the communications of an incoming U. S. administration official, the   or the   elect’s transition team. ROGERS: It depends under what authority work, as I said early on, there’s a series of questions we go through, was there criminal associated activity, does the conversation deal about threats to U. S. persons, breaking of the law. So there’s no simple yes or no, there’s a series of processes we have in place. TURNER: Mr. Rogers, is there any provision of minimization that requires you to cease collection? Because that is my question, are you under any circumstances required to cease collection if the collection results in the either inadvertent or incidental collection of an incoming U. S. administration official, the   or the  ’s transition team? ROGERS: Purely on the basis of exposure, I wanna make sure I understand the question, is    is. .. (CROSSTALK) TURNER: Are you required to cease, if you are    are undertaking lawful collection under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of a person or individual, either because they’re a foreign person located outside the United States or the person that you’re collecting against, is the subject of a FISA Court order. If incidental to that collection or inadvertently, the collection results in the collection of communications of an incoming U. S. administration official, the   or the  ’s transition team, are you required under the minimization procedures, to cease collection? ROGERS: Not automatically. TURNER: Thank you. So the answer’s no, correct? Well, the reason why this is important is because intuitively, we would all know that incoming administration would have conversations with those that the intelligence community may be collecting against, either by making phone calls to them or receiving phone calls to them. And so it’s important for us to understand that the minimization procedures that are intended to collect the privacy rights of Americans, do not inherently include the    a prohibition of the intelligence community incidentally or inadvertently, collecting the communications of an incoming administration. ROGERS: Yes, sir. TURNER: Yep. Mr. Comey, are you aware whether or not the Director of National Intelligence Director Clapper, ever briefed the President of the United States, then President Obama, concerning the possible inadvertent or incidental collection or interception by the U. S. intelligence community of any communication of members of the incoming Trump administration? COMEY: That’s not something I can comment on. TURNER: And then why not, Mr. Comey. COMEY: A couple of reasons, it might involve classified information, it might involve communications with the president of the United States. On both of those grounds, I can’t talk about it here. TURNER: Mr. Comey, have you previously discussed your conversations with President Obama with this committee? COMEY: I don’t remember. I may have with the chair and ranking, I don’t remember with the full committee. TURNER: Well, we’ll have to refresh your memory on those conversations, then. Mr. Comey, did and am used to combing. I did President Obama ever acknowledge to you of having been briefed, concerning possibly inadvertent or incidental collection or interception by the intelligence community of any communications of members of the incoming Trump administration? COMEY: I have to give you the same answer, Mr. Turner. TURNER: Well, Mr. Comey, the first question related to whether or not Mr. Clapper had briefed the president of the United States and we’ll certainly be following up with him. He is going to be appearing before us next week and we’ll certainly be directing the question to him also. So Mr. Comey, are you aware of any evidence that General Flynn prior to the inauguration, ever communicated to the Russian government or a Russian government official that the Trump administration in the future would release, resend, or reverse U. S. sanctions against Russia or ever made any offer of a quid pro quo for releasing resending or reversing U. S. sanctions against Russia. Are you aware of any evidence? COMEY: That’s not something I can comment on, Mr. Turner. TUNER: And why’s that? COMEY: I’m trying very hard not to talk about anything that relates to a U. S. person, or that might rule in or rule out things, might be investigating. I’m trying to be studiously vague here to protect the integrity of the investigation. So please don’t    as I said in the beginning please don’t interpret my no comment as meaning this or meaning that. I just can’t comment. TURNER: Well, Mr. Comey, there are statutes, guidelines and procedures concerning the what does it take for the FBI to open up a counterintelligence investigation into a U. S. citizen. It is not just subject to discretion. You can’t just say well let’s go look at somebody, you have to have a basis. You’ve now informed us that you’ve opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, members the Trump campaign, concerning Russia in July of 2006 (sic). Now we’re trying to get a picture of what does it take to tip over for investigation? Now previously people have said that there been individuals who attended a meeting with Russian officials, individuals who    a member who was paid to attend a conference, a picture that was taken, traveled to a foreign place. There many people both in    in all of our administrations and sometimes, you know, certainly members who have left Congress who would all qualify for that. What    what is the tipping point? I mean it can’t just be that. Don’t you need some action or some information besides just attending a meeting, having been paid to attend a conference, that a picture was taken, or that you traveled to a country before your open to investigation for counterintelligence by the FBI? COMEY: The standard is, I think there’s a couple different at play. A credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power. TURNER: Well the reason why we’re with this, Mr. Comey, is that we obviously have the statements of Mr. Clapper that there is no evidence of collusion with Russia and he just left the intelligence community. And as you are aware, we now sit because this is you said, Admiral Rogers, you know, the Russians wanted to put a cloud over our system. And Mr. Comey, by your announcement today, I mean, there is now a cloud that undermines our system. There is a cloud that where we’re sitting with Mr. Clapper who was obviously in a very important position to know, who stated to us that there is no evidence of conclusion, and you will not give us evidence or    or    or give us any    any substantive evaluation of it. We now sit with this cloud and it’s important that    Mr. Chairman I have a few additional questions if I might when we regain time. NUNES: We’ll get back to Mr. Turner. Mr. Schiff’s recognized for 15 minutes. SCHIFF: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I recognize representative Jackie Speier. SPEIER: Thank you Mr. Schiff. Again, let’s go back to this tarantula web. So Mr. Tillerson, in 2014, started to lobby the United States government asking them to shifter or lift the sanctions. Now in his    his confirmation hearing he says he’s    as he said, I have never lobbied against sanctions, personally, to my knowledge, Exxon Mobil never directly lobbied against sanctions. And yet there is lobbying reporting that shows that Exxon Mobil actually paid over $300, 000 to lobbyists in 2014. And that Mr. Tillerson visited the White House five times in 2014 and treasury with Secretary Lew, seven times. Is    is there something disconcerting about a U. S. CEO attempting to undermine The sanctions imposed by our government against another country for acts that we find to be disadvantageous to the world order. Director Comey? COMEY: That’s not a question I can answer. For a variety of reasons, I’m not qualified to answer and I shouldn’t be answering questions like that. SPEIER: All right. OK. How about this then? Is it disconcerting to you as the director of the FBI that a U. S. CEO would say publicly that he is very close friends with President Putin and has had a   relationship with him? COMEY: That’s not a question I can answer. SPEIER: Would it raise any red flags? COMEY: That’s not a question I can answer. SPEIER: Admiral Rogers? ROGERS: Ma’am, lots of American corporations do business in Russia. I have no knowledge of the specifics you’re talking about, I am in no way qualified or knowledgeable enough to comment on this. SPEIER: All right, let’s move on to someone else in that web. His name is Michael Caputo. He’s a PR professional, conservative radio talk show host. In 1994, he moved to Russia and there he was working for the agency for international development. He was fired from that job because he refused to follow a State Department position. He then opened a PR firm in Moscow and married a Russian woman. He subsequently divorced her and in 1999 his business failed. Roger Stone, a mentor to him, urged him to move to Florida and open his PR firm in Miami which is exactly what Mr. Caputo did. And then in 2000 he worked with   to improve Putin’s image in the United States. Now, do we know who   is? Do you know anything about Gazprom, Director? COMEY: I don’t. SPEIER: Well, it’s a    it’s an oil company. In 2007, he began consulting the Ukrainian parliamentary campaign. There he met his second wife. So I guess my question is, what possible reason is there for the Trump campaign to hire Putin’s image consultant? Any thoughts on that Director Comey? COMEY: No thoughts. SPEIER: Admiral Rogers? ROGERS: Likewise, ma’am. SPEIER: All right. Do either of you know what Michael Caputo is doing for the Trump effort today? ROGERS: I have no idea. COMEY: And I’m not going to talk about U. S. persons. SPEIER: All right, let’s move on now to Carter Page. Carter Page was the founder of Global Energy, it’s an investment fund. He has only one partner and that partner is Sergei Yatsenko who’s the former executive of a Russian   Gazprom oil company. Before that, from 2004 to 2007, he worked for Merrill Lynch in Moscow. In March of 2016,   Trump referred to Carter Page as his foreign policy advisor to the Washington Post. The next day, Page asserts that he’s an advisor on Russia and energy. But then subsequently, Candidate Trump says he doesn’t know him. SPEIER: On September 26, he takes a leave of absence from the campaign and then Page publicly supports a relationship with Russia, criticizes U. S. sanctions and NATO’s approach to Russia, saying    and then subsequently says he’s divesting his stake in Gazprom in August. In 2014, he writes an article criticizing the U. S. sanctions, praising Sechin in an article and global policy and then rebuked the west for focusing on   annexation of Crimea. In July of 2016, he gives a graduation speech at the new economic school, denies meeting with the prime minister, Christopher Steele, in his dossier, says he met with, again, Igor Sechin, offering a 19 percent interest in Rosneft. It becomes the biggest transfer of public property to private ownership. Now, Carter Page is a national security adviser to Donald Trump. Do you believe that    why do we    I guess, again, here’s another company that has had sanctions imposed upon it. Could you again clarify why we impose sanctions on companies? COMEY: Admiral Rogers did it better than I, so I’m going to (inaudible) him. SPEIER: OK. ROGERS: I apologize. I don’t remember the specifics of my answer, but I’ll stand by my answer. .. COMEY: Which was excellent. SPEIER: All right. I think at that point, I will yield back, Mr. Chair. SCHIFF: I now yield to Mr. Quigley. QUIGLEY: Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. Gentlemen, thank you for your service. Thank you for being here. We’ve talked a little bit about the Russian playboook, right? Extortion, bribery, false news, disinformation, they all sound very familiar, correct? Well, as we talk, without thinking about anybody in the United States, just generally the Russian playbook and how it’s worked in particularly Eastern Europe and Central Europe, a lot of it involves trying to influence individuals in that country, correct? ROGERS: Yes. QUIGLEY: So what we’ve talked about a little bit today seems so    be sort of a black and white notion of whether there was collusion, but does a Russian active measure attempting to succeed at collusion    does the person involved have to actually know? I mean, does it have to involve knowing collusion for there to be damage? COMEY: I can answer generally. In the world of intelligence, oftentimes there are people who are called   who are acting    don’t realize they’re dealing with agents of a foreign power and so are doing things for someone they think is a friend or a business associate, not realizing it’s for that    the foreign government. So it can happen, it’s actually quite a frequent technique. QUIGLEY: Is it beyond that sometimes to include things where the    the actor doesn’t necessarily know what they’re doing is helping that other government? COMEY: Exactly. QUIGLEY: And what are instances, just examples of what that might include in a generic sense, in Europe and so forth? COMEY: Oftentimes, a researcher here in the United States may think they’re dealing with a peer researcher in a foreign government and not knowing that that researcher is either knowingly or unwittingly passing information to a foreign adversary of the United States. QUIGLEY: And can you explain and elaborate how this sort of    problems with defining what collusion is    the differences that might be involved with explicit or implicit collusion? COMEY: Collusion is not a term, a legal term of art and it’s one I haven’t used here today, as we’re investigating to see whether there was any coordination between people associated with the campaign. .. QUIGLEY: Explicit or implicit coordination? COMEY: I guess implicit, I    I would think of it as knowing or unknowing. You can do things to help a foreign nation state, as I said, without realizing that you’re dealing with. You think you’re helping a buddy, who’s a researcher at a university in China and what you’re actually doing is passing information that ends up with the Chinese government. That’s unwitting, I don’t know whether it’s same as your implicit. Explicit would be, you know, I’m sending this stuff to this researcher in China and I’m doing it because I wanna help the Chinese government and I know he’s hooked up with the Chinese government. QUIGLEY: Admiral Rogers, would you give other examples of what you witnessed in your career? ROGERS: Sometimes, U. S. individuals would be approached by other individuals connected with    with foreign connections who will misrepresent what not just the researcher, they’ll assume an identity if you will, hey I want you to think that I’m actually working for a business, exploring commercial interests, those kinds of things. Create a relationship and then it turns out, there really is no commercial interest, here they’re acting as a direct extension of a foreign government. .. (CROSSTALK) COMEY: And romance can be a feature. Somebody dating someone to create a close relationship and the U. S. government person thinks that they’re in love with this person and    and vice versa and the other person’s actually an agent of a foreign power, that’s sort of a classic example. QUIGLEY: You describe this as naive acquiescence? COMEY: I don’t    I’m not sure I know what that means, exactly (ph). ROGERS: I don’t know what that really means (ph). QUIGLEY: You’re    you’re going along with it and without really acknowledging, understanding in your mind or being naive about the issue. COMEY: Sure, that can happen. ROGERS: Yeah, you see that at times. QUIGLEY: OK. Going on to things that you    you probably can’t comment upon which is of equal concern. We’re all, at this point, very familiar with Mr. Sessions’s testimony before the United States Senate in which he specifically said he had    he wasn’t one who had this contact with the Russians. And then there was the amended, I guess, testimony in which he acknowledged I believe two such testimonies. The first was in July during the convention and then later in September afterwards. All the while, that the issues that we are talking about today, the hacking, the dumping of materials were taking placing and certainly, someone in the position of Mr. Senator Sessions would’ve been aware of this. Perhaps, would’ve remembered these conversations or might’ve mentioned or asked the Russian ambassador to knock it off. But apparently, none of those things happened or at least he didn’t remember that they happened. Unfortunately, what we’re reading now is that there was a third meeting as early as April of last year in Washington, D. C. a meeting which Candidate Trump was present and the Russian ambassador was present. At some point in time, this goes well beyond an innocent, under the best of circumstances, oh I forgot sort of thing, or that doesn’t count. When you correct your testimony in front of the United States Senate, you’re still under oath and you’re swearing to the American people that what you’re saying is true. Well, the third time is well beyond that and is quite simply perjury. So as we look at this as we go forward, gentlemen, I ask that you take that into consideration. This is far more than what we have talked about just in the general sense, did the Russians hack or not and the scope of this too, a concerted effort and plan to lie to the American public about what took place and what the motivations were beyond these    this process. Again, I thank you for your service. And I yield back to the ranking member. SCHIFF: I yield to Mr. Swalwell of California. SWALWELL: Thank you, Director Comey and Admiral Rogers. Director Comey, you’ve served time in a courtroom as a prosecutor and I’m wondering if you remember the instruction that is read to juries every day that if you decide that a witness deliberately lied about something significant in this case, you should consider not believing anything that witness says. COMEY: Yes, that’s familiar to me. SWALWELL: And your testimony at the beginning of this hearing was that President Trump’s claims that former President Obama had wiretapped him is false. COMEY: I said we have no information that supports them. SWALWELL: Thank you. With respect to Donald Trump, do you remember the other instruction relating to truthfulness of a witness or a defendant? If the defendant makes a false or misleading statement relating to the charged crime knowing the statement was false or intending to mislead that conduct may also show he or she were aware of their guilt. COMEY: Yes, familiar to me from my distant past. SWALWELL: I want talk about the Kremlin playbook and there are a number of ways that a foreign adversary can seek to influence a person, do you agree with that? COMEY: Yes. SWALWELL: Financial? COMEY: Yes, that can be one. SWALWELL: Romance you said is another. COMEY: Yes. SWALWELL: Compromise? COMEY: Correct. SWALWELL: Setting up a compromise? COMEY: Sure, to execute on a compromise, yes. SWALWELL: How about inadvertently capturing a compromise, meaning they have vast surveillance and you stumble into that surveillance and are caught in compromise? COMEY: And then they take that information, try and use it to coerce you? Yes, that’s part of the playbook. SWALWELL: I’ll yield back, Chair, and continue once I’m back with us. Thank you, Director. NUNES: Gentleman’s time’s expired. We’ll go back to Mr. Turner. TURNER: Thank you. I want to go back to the issue of    Admiral Rogers indicated that the goal of the Russians is to put a cloud on our system to undermine our system. And    and I would think, certainly today, Mr. Comey, with your announcement of an investigation that the Russians would be very happy with that as an outcome because the cloud of their actions and activities continues and will continue to undermine and until your finished with whatever your investigation is currently in the scope of. I want to go back to the issue of how does one open an investigation because again, I’m    I’m a little confused by    by some of the things that we hear as to the basis of an investigation. Now, Mr. Comey, if    if an individual attends a meeting with a foreign leader is    is that enough to open a counter intelligence investigation? COMEY: Without more that somebody met with somebody, no. TUNER: No. OK. Without more than if they had their picture taken with a foreign leader, is that enough? COMEY: It would depend upon where they were, who took the picture. TURNER: Well, assume that they’re in would (ph) that    the foreign country, and in that foreign leaders government offices or facilities, if they’re having a picture taken with them, is that enough to open a counterintelligence investigation? COMEY: It would depend. TURNER: On    on what? Because I’m saying if there’s just a picture. Because I can tell you certainly there’s lots of people who have had lots of pictures. COMEY: Yeah. TURNER: Is it enough that a person who has just had their picture taken with a foreign leader at the foreign leaders government official offices or place of residence? COMEY: The reason I said it depends is it would depend. Did the person sneak over to the foreign country and meet them clandestinely, did    was the picture    reveal something else about the relationship? It just hard to. .. TUNER: Well, let’s say it’s not clandestine. Let’s say it’s open, that the person has    as    has attended an event and has gone over to meet with the foreign person, foreign government official and is at their foreign government official facility or their official residence and has a picture taken and has no intention of covertly being present with the foreign person, is that picture enough to open a counterintelligence investigation? COMEY: Tricky to answer hypotheticals, but I think my reaction to that is that doesn’t strike me as enough. And I know your next question’s going to be deeper into hypos. TURNER: No, no, I’m not getting deep into hypos. These are pretty straightforward. So what if you’re paid, you know, to attend a conference in a foreign    in a foreign country and you’re paid to attend that conference not directly by the foreign government, but nonetheless payment does occur for you to attend a conference? We know President Bill Clinton attended many such conferences and spoke and received payment. Is receiving payment by attending to speak at a conference    again, it’s not covert, it’s open. They’re attending to speak at a conference, they receive payment for the purposes of speaking, is that enough to open a counterintelligence investigation? COMEY: I can’t say as I sit here. It would depend upon a lot of different things. TURNER: If you had no other information or evidence other than the fact that they attended, is that enough for you, for the FBI to open a counterintelligence investigation of a private U. S. citizen? COMEY: I can’t answer the hypothetical because it would depend upon a number of other things. TURNER: I limited it to where there would be no other things, Mr. Comey. I said only, if the only information that you had was that they had intended an event in which they were paid which was a conference and it was not covert, is that only sufficient information to open an investigation against a private U. S. citizen? COMEY: Who paid them? Did they disclose it? What did they discuss when they were there? Who else was sitting with them? There’s lots and lots of other circumstances that make that    even that   hypo difficult to answer. TURNER: Well, let’s say that they’ve traveled to a foreign country and they openly traveled, wasn’t covert. Is traveling there enough? COMEY: Just traveling around the world, no. TURNER: OK, well I’m very concerned, Mr. Comey, about the issue of how an investigation is opened and    and how we end up at this situation once again where Mr. Clapper, had (ph) the director of national intelligence, just said that when he left there was no evidence of collusion and yet, as Admiral Rogers said, we’re sitting now where the Russians’ goal is being achieved of causing a cloud or undermining our electoral process. So I certainly hope that you take an expeditious look at what you have undertaken because it affects the heart of our democracy. Mr. Comey, I have a question against    again concerning classified information. Now, I know that if I attend a classified briefing and I receive classified information and I go and tell someone that classified information, if I leak it, I release it, then I’ve committed a crime. But what if someone goes to a classified briefing, walks out of that briefing, and openly lies about the content of that briefing? Because it’s unclear to me what happens then. And it’s important because, as you know, this committee and certainly both of you gentlemen have handled a lot of classified information and recently, more recently, the purported classified information is put out in the press, The Washington Post, The New York Times reports information. And you know and I know and we all know, having handled classified information, that some of that information is not true. Are the sources of that classified information, if they come out and lie about the content of classified information, have they committed a crime? COMEY: That’s a really interesting question. I don’t think so. If all they’ve done is lie to a reporter, that’s not against the law. If they’ve done it, I don’t wanna break anybody’s hearts with that but that’s not against the law. But it is not and the reason I’m hesitating is, I can imagine a circumstance where it’s part of some broader conspiracy or something, but just that false statement to a reporter is not a crime. TURNER: And I just wanna underscore that for a    just for a second, because I agree with you. I think it’s no crime. And so every reporter out there that has someone standing in front of them and saying oh, I’m taking this great risk of sharing with you U. S. secrets, besides them purporting to be a traitor, are committing no crime if they lie to them. So all of these news articles that contain this information that we know is not    not the case, are being done so at damage to the United States but without the risk of a crime. And my next aspect of your question to Mr. Comey, is this. What is the obligation of the intelligence community to correct such falsehoods? Some of this information that we read in the Washington Post and the New York Times, is extremely false and extremely incendiary and extremely condemning of individuals and certainly, our whole system. What is your obligation, Mr. Comey, to be that source to say I can’t release classified information, but I can tell you, it’s not that? COMEY: Yeah, it’s a great question, Mr. Turner, because there’s a whole lot out there that is false. And I suppose some of it could be people lying to reporters. I think that probably happens. But more often than not, it’s people who    who act like they know when they really don’t know. Because they’re not the people who actually know the secrets, they’re one or two hops out and they’re passing along (ph) things they think they know. There is    we had not only have no obligation to correct that, we can’t, because if we start calling reporters and saying hey, this thing you said about this new aircraft we’ve developed, that’s inaccurate actually, it’s got two engines. We just can’t do that because we’ll give information to our adversaries that way and it’s very, very frustrating but we can’t start down that road. Now, when it’s unclassified information, if a reporter misreports the contents of a bill that’s being debated in Congress or a policy, we can call him and say hey, you ought to read it more carefully. You missed this or missed that. We cannot do that with classified information. It’s very, very frustrating because I have read a whole lot of stuff, especially in the last two months, this is just wrong. But I can’t say which is wrong and I can’t say it to those reporters. TURNER: Mr. Comey, if you could help us on this issue, I would greatly appreciate it because what happens, is that you come into a classified briefing with us and you tell us, perhaps what something that is absolutely false, it really shouldn’t be classified because you’re telling us it’s not true. But yet, we can’t go tell it’s not true because you told us in a classified setting. If there’s a way that we can at least have some exchange as to what’s not true so the American people don’t listen to false stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times that we all know are not true, that would be helpful. COMEY: Yeah, I don’t. .. TURNER: If you could think about how you could help us with that. COMEY: I’d love to invent that machine, but we can’t because where do you stop that on that slope? TURNER: Well, false is false, Mr. Comey. COMEY: Because then, when I don’t call The New York Times to say you got that one wrong, bingo, they got that one right. And so I    it’s just an enormously complicated endeavor for us. We have to stay clear of it entirely. TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Comey, one last question. So we all read in the press that Vice President Pence publicly denied that General Flynn discussed sanctions with Russia. And I’m assuming that you saw those news reports. Did the FBI take any action in response to the vice president statements? COMEY: I can’t comment on that, Mr. Turner. TURNER: Mr. Comey, The New York Times reported on February 14th, 2017, that General Flynn was interviewed by FBI personnel. Is that correct? COMEY: I can’t comment on that, Mr. Turner. TURNER: Mr. Comey, I do not have any additional questions, but I thank you both for your participation. And again, I thank for the    the chairman and ranking member for the bipartisan aspect of this investigation. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Dr. Wenstrup is recognized. WENSTRUP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you gentlemen for being here, I appreciate your endurance in this effort today. One question, how long has Russia or the Soviet Union been interfering or attempting to interfere with our election process? ROGERS: In the report we’ve feebly (ph) talked about, we have seen this kind of behavior to some degree attempting to influence outcomes for decades. (CROSSTALK) WENSTRUP: Going back to    going back the Soviet Union. .. ROGERS: Right. Not to the same level necessary, but the basic trend has been there. WENSTRUP: So I’m curious also about what triggers a counterintelligence investigation of a government official. And in some ways, I’m asking for myself. For example, last week I spoke at an event on form policy with Atlantic Council. Unbeknownst to me, the Iraqi ambassador of the United States was there. He comes up to me afterwards, introduces himself and says he’d like to meet with me at some time. So this isn’t a theoretical, this is real and this is what I’m asking is this. Will be in trouble or under investigation if I meet with him? COMEY: This is the slope I tried to avoid going down with Mr. Turner. Dr. Wenstrup, I    I don’t think I should be answering hypotheticals. The question is. .. WENSTRUP: It’s not hypothetical because I’m asking you in advance because I want to know if I can meet with him and be under investigation or not and I don’t think that’s an unrealistic question. This is real. This is right now. COMEY: I get that. The FBI does not give advisory opinions, and so if you’re asking about your particular case, I just can’t do that. WENSTRUP: So you’ll tell me afterwards? COMEY: No, I’ll    I’ll never tell you. (LAUGHTER) WENSTRUP: Well, you might. Somebody might, somebody might tell the press, right? And that’s where I’m going next because I want to know what    what can I discuss? What am I allowed to discuss? And what    what triggers the investigation is really what we’re trying to get to in general. You know, maybe not with the Iraqi ambassador, but what about with the Russian ambassador? What are my obligations? What am I    do I need to advise someone that I’m meeting with them? Do I have to discuss the agenda before I meet with them? You know, just so we’re clear. I mean, this is really what it’s coming down to, is a lot about what we’re talking about. You know, so I don’t think it’s unnecessary or ridiculous for me to ask that. And so in intelligence reporting, if the identity of a U. S. official is disseminated to those on an as needed basis    or those that need to know basis. Does that generally lead to a counterintelligence investigation of that individual? So in    in general, if a U. S. official is    is    is in this report and it’s disseminated, does that lead to an investigation of the individual? COMEY: No, not in general, not as a rule. No. WENSTRUP: OK. That answers. .. (CROSSTALK) COMEY: It would depend on lots of the circumstances. WENSTRUP: Next, I want to go to the article from February 14 in The New York Times which I believe we’re all familiar. And you may not be able to answer any of these, but the article sites four current and former American officials. Do you know    know the identity of those four officials? COMEY: Not going to comment on an article. WENSTRUP: OK. Well, it’s not necessarily on the article, but OK. Do you know for a fact that the four current and former American officials provided information for the story? COMEY: I have to give you the same answer. WENSTRUP: OK. With or without an investigation going on, has anyone told you that they know who leaked the information or who leaked any information on Russian involvement in the U. S. elections or Russian involvement with the Trump election team? COMEY: I’m not going to comment on that. WENSTRUP: Is it possible that The New York Times misrepresented its sourcing for this February 14 article? Possible. COMEY: I can’t comment on that. WENSTRUP: Is it possible that The New York Times was misled by individuals claiming to be current or former American officials. COMEY: I’ll give you the same answer, Dr. Wenstrup. WENSTRUP: Can I ask why you can’t comment on that? COMEY: I think a number of reasons. I’m not confirming that the information in that article is accurate or inaccurate. I’m not going to get in the business of    that we talked about earlier. .. WENSTRUP: OK. Is it    then let me ask you this. COMEY: And there’s other reasons. WENSTRUP: Sure. COMEY: That I’m also not going to confirm whether we’re investigating things, and so if I start talking about what I know about a particular article, I run the risk of stepping on both of those landmines. WENSTRUP: I guess one more question before the time is up and we’ll come back to me, but I am curious, is it possible    and nothing to do with this article. Is it possible that a   source to a media outlet may actually be a Russian advocate? Nothing to do with this story per say, just is it possible that a Russian surrogate could actually be the source that a newspaper is relying on? COMEY: In general, sure, somebody could always be pretending to be something they’re not. WENSTRUP: Thank you. And I yield back at this time. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Schiff’s recognized for 15 minutes. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple   questions and then I’ll pass it to Mr. Quigley for entering something into the record. COMEY: Mr. Chairman, can I ask you for an estimated time? I’m not made of steel, so I might need to take a quick break. NUNES: Would you like to do that now? COMEY: If you can, I didn’t know how much longer you planned to go. NUNES: I think we want to keep going until the members have asked all their questions. COMEY: OK. Just a quick rest stop? NUNES: Yes. So we’ll break for about 10 minutes. COMEY: That’s plenty. (CROSSTALK) (RECESS) NUNES: I’m gonna call the hearing back into order after a brief recess. I wanna get on with questions. I’m gonna yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from California, Mr. Schiff. SCHIFF: Director Comey, just a couple   questions before I pass it to Mr. Quigley to enter something in the record. You’ve been asked a number of questions today about is it enough to open an investigation because someone travels or is enough because they have their photograph taken or enough because they attend a conference. I would imagine that you get so many leads, so many people writing to you with information that they’re convinced shows (ph) a crime that if you investigated everything that people sent you, you would be squandering your investigative resources in a way you can’t afford to do. My understanding, and correct me if I’m wrong, is that in order for you to open an investigation, you need to see credible information or evidence that someone has either committed a federal crime or become an agent of a foreign power. Is that an accurate understanding? COMEY: Yeah, that’s a fair statement. And as you said, Mr. Schiff, we have to also choose which    we get a lot of referrals, which ones align with the threats that the FBI is trying to prioritize because we have limited resources. SCHIFF: Exactly. So even when those criteria are met, that enough may not be    that in and of itself may not be enough because you have so many other cases you need to investigate and you have to prioritize. COMEY: Correct. SCHIFF: I also wanna ask you, you mentioned that it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to be telling reporters that stories they’re writing are accurate or inaccurate when they may involve an investigation. That’s not an appropriate thing for you to do. COMEY: Correct, especially if the story involves classified information. SCHIFF: And that’s because you would either be disclosing classified information potentially in what you’re confirming, or by rebutting a story that was inaccurate, you may be suggesting other stories that contain classified information or then (ph) accurate? COMEY: Correct. SCHIFF: Now, it’s inappropriate for you to be batting down inaccurate stories. Would you also agree it’s    if it’s inappropriate for you to be batting down inaccurate stories, would you also agree it’s inappropriate for the White House to be asking the FBI to be rebutting stories they don’t like? COMEY: Yeah, that’s when I don’t wanna answer, Mr. Schiff, because I don’t wanna talk about communications within the executive branch. I can speak for the FBI, that’s not something the FBI can or should do. SCHIFF: And if you were appearing up before the Senate for confirmation and they asked you as director of the FBI, if you were asked by the White House to refute or acknowledge press stories that they liked or didn’t like, what would you tell the Senate in your confirmation hearing? Would that be appropriate for your office? COMEY: I would figure out what was the right thing for the FBI to do and then do that thing. SCHIFF: And that right thing would be not to be in the business of confirming or denying stories about classified information? COMEY: Correct, that’s what    that’s with the right thing is for the FBI. SCHIFF: Let me recognize Mr. Quigley for purposes of entering something in the record. QUIGLEY: Thank you, Mr. Ranking Member. As I do that, I’m reminded of what Hugo Black said, ”Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.” I respectfully ask to enter a March 8th article entitled, ”Jeff Sessions Likely Met Russian Ambassador a Third Time.” SCHIFF: I now yield to Mr. Swalwell. SWALWELL: Thank you to our ranking member. And thank you again to    to our director and Admiral Rogers. Director, would you agree that the FBI, when it’s considering the counterintelligence investigation, views contacts between U. S. persons and say Russia differently than it would view contacts between U. S. persons and the U. K. or France or Germans? COMEY: Yes, very much so. SWALWELL: And that’s because they’re a foreign adversary? COMEY: Correct. SWALWELL: And so to land on Russia’s radar as somebody that they may want to recruit, would you agree that being a businessperson, a prominent business person is something that would be attractive to them? COMEY: Could be. Might depend upon what industry you’re in. SWALWELL: Could it also    could also being a politician be something that would be attractive to them? COMEY: Sure. SWALWELL: And how about somebody who does business with Russians, would that be attractive to them? COMEY: Could be. It would depend upon other things as well though. SWALWELL: And we were starting to discuss this, efforts to recruit include investing in a U. S. person, is that correct? COMEY: Efforts by Russia to invest typically? SWALWELL: Yes. COMEY: In their tradecraft, that can be one of the ways in which they cultivate a relationship, sure. SWALWELL: And if you are a U. S. person with a business, could it also include investing in your business or being a partner in some of your endeavors? COMEY: Lots of different ways someone could try and establish a relationship. SWALWELL: And going back to compromise, can we assume that any prominent U. S. person traveling to Russia would probably be covered by Russian surveillance? COMEY: Depend upon how you define prominent, but they have an extensive surveillance operation of foreign visitors. So no matter who you are, you ought to assume it, but whether that’s true in reality is harder for me to answer. Or do you want to answer that differently? ROGERS: No, I agree. SWALWELL: And Russia is attempting to recruit and persuade individuals that we’ve discussed before, just as other foreign adversaries are because they want to get something out of them, is that right? COMEY: Correct. SWALWELL: And in many cases, it could be if that person is ever in a position of power that they could be in a position to influence policy in the United States. COMEY: To influence policy or to supply them with information that’s useful to them and maybe other purposes. SWALWELL: Now, with respect to your counterintelligence investigations, would be important for you if you were concerned that a U. S. person had financial entanglements with a foreign adversary to see that persons tax returns? COMEY: That’s a hypothetical I really want to avoid answering, but the answer is it would depend really. It would depend upon a whole lot of circumstances. SWALWELL: That would be one of the pieces of evidence that you would consider looking? COMEY: Maybe, maybe. You    you might be able to get the picture you need from other financial records that are more readily available. SWALWELL: And you’re aware director that President Trump has refused, breaking with tradition of the past 40 years to show the American people his tax returns? COMEY: Not something I want to comment on. I’m aware of it from the media. SWALWELL: Now, Russia also in their efforts to recruit individuals and develop individuals, praying on or following someone’s financial distress is also an avenue number may pursue, is that right? COMEY: Potentially, if it offers an avenue for leverage on someone. SWALWELL: And Director, would you consider six bankruptcies that an individual may have as been a point of leverage? COMEY: I can’t say. I don’t know. SWALWELL: And Director, you’re aware that President Trump is at six prior bankruptcies? COMEY: That’s not something I’m going to comment on. SWALWELL: And Director, when your agents are conducting a counterintelligence investigation with respect to a foreign adversary in their efforts to recruit or cooperate with a U. S. person, would you look at the U. S. person’s travel to that country? COMEY: As part of evaluating whether there is an illicit relationship? SWALWELL: Yes. COMEY: Sure. SWALWELL: And are you familiar that President Trump has traveled at least three times to Russia? COMEY: That’s not something I’m going to comment on. SWALWELL: Are you aware that his son, Donald Trump Jr. has traveled at least six times to Russia? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Donald Trump has said a number of times that he has had nothing to do with Russia and I want to ask you, Director, if you’re familiar with Deutsche Bank and its $300 million loan to Donald Trump and his organization. COMEY: That’s not something I’m going to comment on. SWALWELL: Director, are you aware that Deutsche Bank has been investigated and fined over $400 million by New York State for failing to stop the corrupt transfer of more than $10 billion out of Russia? COMEY: I think generally from press accounts. SWALWELL: So an individual’s association with the bank that has had dealings with Russian money laundering, that would be something that would be a red flag for a counterintelligence investigation I would assume. COMEY: That’s a hypo I don’t want to answer. SWALWELL: Director, would a U. S. businessperson who is associated with a foreign adversary having tenants in their office building that do business with that foreign adversary, would that be a red flag that a counterintelligence agent would look at? COMEY: I can’t answer that. SWALWELL: Are you aware that in Trump Tower were two tenants, Vadim Trincher and Anatoly Golubchik, who ran a   illegal gambling ring that was run out of Trump Tower? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: And are you aware that the prosecutor in that case was U. S. attorney Preet Bharara? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Are you aware, Director, that that U. S. attorney was recently fired? COMEY: Yes. SWALWELL: By the president of the United States? COMEY: Well, I don’t know who fired him. I know from press accounts that he was asked to leave. SWALWELL: Director, are you aware of Felix Sater, a former Soviet official and adviser to the Trump Organization? COMEY: I’m not going to comment on it. SWALWELL: And Director, outside of Mr. Sater’s relationship with the Trump Organization, are you aware that the FBI knew of Mr. Sater because of a $40 million stock fraud case that was prosecuted by the federal government? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Director, would a U. S. person having multiple trademarks in addition to the other relationships that I just described be a red flag for a counterintelligence investigation if those trademarks were in Russia? COMEY: Multiple trademarks? SWALWELL: Yeah, registering trademarks in a foreign adversary’s country. COMEY: I don’t know what to make of that. SWALWELL: OK. Were you aware that Donald Trump had six trademarks in Russia? COMEY: Not going to comment on that. SWALWELL: Were you aware that Donald Trump tried to market his Trump Vodka brand in Russia? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Were you aware that Donald Trump ran Ms. Universe 2013 out of Moscow? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Are you aware that Donald Trump Jr. said on a number of occasions that Russian money is pouring into the Trump Organization and that there is a disproportionate   of the company’s revenue coming from Russian money? COMEY: Same answer, Mr. Swalwell. SWALWELL: So hypothetically speaking though, would a foreign adversary and its oligarchs having a disproportionate   of a company’s revenue coming from that country, would that be a red flag for a counterintelligence agent? COMEY: I’m not    I’m trying to be helpful, but I’m not going to answer that hypo. .. SWALWELL: I understand. Thank you, Director. Director, are you familiar with a 2004 home purchase by President Trump in Palm Beach County for about $40 million? COMEY: Not going to comment on that. SWALWELL: Are you familiar with a 2008 sale of that same property for 129 percent increase at about $98 million? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Are you aware that the buyer in 2008 was a Russian businessman? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: And under the earlier hypothetical, would a foreign adversary’s oligarch purchasing a home in the United States for 129 percent more than the home was purchased four years before. Would that be a tool that a foreign adversary would use to try and recruit, develop or bring somebody onto their side? COMEY: Same answer as before. SWALWELL: You said that it’s likely or somebody should assume they’re being surveilled when they were in Russia. Would you assume that Donald Trump was being surveilled in 2013 when he was in Moscow? COMEY: I’m not gonna answer. I    I was trying to confine my answer to prominent people should assume, not you know, students and all those people who might go there for a brief holiday, I don’t think I’d ask them to assume that. SWALWELL: Right. Would it be safe to say that if Donald Trump was doing something he shouldn’t have been doing while he was in Russia, the Russians probably saw it? COMEY: Same answer as before. SWALWELL: Would it be safe to assume that if a prominent person was doing something they shouldn’t have been doing while they’re in Russia, the Russians probably saw it? COMEY: Yeah, I would stick to what I said before about prominent people should assume. SWALWELL: Mr. Director, was Donald Trump under investigation during the campaign? COMEY: Same answer as before. I’m not gonna answer that. SWALWELL: Is he under investigation now? COMEY: I’m not gonna answer that. Please don’t over interpret what I’ve said as    as the chair and ranking know, we have briefed him in great detail on the subjects of the investigation and what we’re doing, but I’m not gonna answer about anybody in this forum. SWALWELL: Director, from our perspective on the committee, the dots continue to connect. President Trump, his team, people in his orbit, to Russia. And the questions that we have, it’s quite simple. Are these merely 100 different coincidences or is this a convergence where you’re seeing deep personal, political and financial ties, meeting Russia’s interference in our campaign? So I’m wondering, Director, with your extensive counterintelligence expertise and in view of the Russian intelligence campaign to influence the election in which Donald Trump was candidate, do you consider this    these number of connections between   Russians and Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, the Trump family and the Trump campaign, to be a coincidence or a convergence? COMEY: I’m not gonna answer, Mr. Swalwell. SWALWELL: From your perspective, Director, have you ever seen in the history of American politics or at least since you’ve been alive, any political candidate have this many connections, personal, political and financial, to a foreign adversary? COMEY: Same answer. SWALWELL: Mr. Director and Admiral Rogers, this past election, our country was attacked. We were attacked by Russia. It was electronic. It was nearly invisible. Thanks to the hard work of the men and women who serve in our intelligence community, we know that the attack came from Russian. It was ordered by Vladimir Putin. He sought to help Donald Trump and to take down Hillary Clinton. The most disturbing finding for me and my fellow committee members is that Russia intends to do this again. And I see this as an opportunity for everyone on this committee, Republicans and Democrats, to not look in the rearview window but to look forward and do everything we can to make sure that our country never again allows a foreign adversary to attack us. Because I think, Director, you and Admiral Rogers would agree that it’s not only Russia that is sharpening the knives to go back at us or to go at our allies. It’s also other countries who have similar capabilities. And so, I think the best thing we can do now is unite around this investigation, have also a parallel, independent commission to make sure we get to the bottom of what happened, why we were so vulnerable and to assure the American people we’ll never let this happen again. And I yield back. NUNES: Dr. Wenstrup? WENSTRUP: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I can, gentlemen, go back to what we were talking about a little bit before with interference from the Russians possibly in through our media. Have Russians or Soviets historically attempted to spread this information through the U. S. media? As (ph) you    you mentioned they’ve been there in over decades trying to interfere, they use media as a resource. ROGERS: We see them use media writ large as a resource to disseminate disinformation, false information. WENSTRUP: And is that    been pretty much regardless of who’s in the White House? ROGERS: It doesn’t seem to tie to a particular political party, that tactic, if you will. WENSTRUP: Thank you. Mr. Comey, have you ever formed    this is going back to the article from February 14 in the New York Times, have you ever formed an articulated opinion about the article from February 14 in the New York Times? COMEY: Have I ever formed and articulated opinion? WENSTRUP: Formed an opinion or articulated an opinion on that article? COMEY: I don’t want to say, Dr. Wenstrup. WENSTRUP: OK. Thank you. When I look at your jobs and thank you for being there and doing your jobs. And I mean that sincerely, your job, you    you observe and you investigate and you assess and you try to predict and you sometimes have to act, would that be correct? COMEY: Sure. WENSTRUP: In what you do. My question is, as far as predictions and actions, Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election for the United States presidency. Which certainly most had predicted, I would conject (ph) that even the Russians predicted that she would win. What    what were the Russians planning for November 9 and beyond that had she won. You mentioned before, and the reason I ask that    you mentioned before you said they’ll be back. My question is have they left? Because I    I would contend they haven’t left. This isn’t something they their turning on and off. This is a constant. So any    any idea what    what may have happened November 9 and beyond that had she won? COMEY: Hard to say. WENSTRUP: The pattern has been to interrupt us regardless of who is in the White House. COMEY: Yes. They want to mess with us and in a continuing and general way. It’s hard to answer the counterfactual. I assume they would’ve continued their efforts to undermine   (sic) Clinton as they had begun doing during the summer, especially with European allies to create a divide there and probably lots of other things. What I meant by they’ll be back is, they’re not going away. But in the    in the    I mean that that in the sense of their next opportunity to mess with our election is two years from now and in four years. That’s what I meant by back. WENSTRUP: Thank you. I think your job is    is difficult because there’s a lot of conjecture about any relationship with Russians in general and questions from me and others about, can I meet with the Russian ambassador? Does that get me investigated? Business ties here and there, you know, I mean currently we share a space station with Russians. We buy engines from the Russians for    for our rockets and in the ’90s we had joint military exercises with the Russians. It gets a little bit tough as    for you guys decide what and    and when do we investigate and I appreciate you taking the time with us today. And I yield back. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Stewart? STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And to the witnesses, thank you both. You know, I’m impressed. I was a   pilot, when I took off one of the first certain (ph) thoughts I had was how long is it going to be until I get to go to bathroom? You guys went almost 4 hours. Our plan was to keep you here until you are in such pain that you would just answer all of our questions. (LAUGHTER) I have a list of questions here but I want to divert a little bit and    and follow up on some of things that have been said here today. Mr. Comey, you confirmed that there’s an investigation in the Trump campaign officials. The fact that there is an open investigation does not indicate guilt though, does it? COMEY: Certainly not. STEWART: And in fact many times in an investigation may find that there is no wrongdoing. COMEY: That’s one of the reasons we don’t talk about it, so we don’t smear people who don’t end up charged with anything. STEWART: I appreciate that and I would say that is especially likely to have, when I say especially talking about have the finding of no wrongdoing when there is a political motive. And if there’s one thing that we’ve seen here today, I think, from some of the line of questions is clearly been a certain political motive in some of the questions that have been asked to you. Mr. Clapper, the former DNI, and we all know who he is, this is someone who should know. I want to read what he said just a few weeks ago. Mr. Clapper then went on to say that to his knowledge there was no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. We did not conclude any evidence in our report and when I say ”our report,” that is the NSA, FBI, and CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence said anything    any reflection of collusion between the members of Trump campaign and the Russians, there was no evidence of that in our report. Was Mr. Clapper wrong when he said that? COMEY: I think he’s right about characterizing the report which you all have read. STEWART: Well, I want you to know I agree with Mr. Clapper. And at this point, everyone on this dais should agree with Mr. Clapper because we in the committee have seen no evidence, zero, that would indicate that there was collusion or criminal wrongdoing between any members of the previous administration or campaign and Russian officials. And I’m going to comment very quickly on the leaks. You’ve said very clearly that it is a crime, both of you have said that, you’ve indicated it endangers national security which I certainly agree with. It makes it hard for us to reauthorize very important tools that we will need in order to protect our national security and many times, it’s inaccurate. And I would ask you then if someone in intelligence community has some concerns, if they feel like there’s been an overreach or the government is doing something they shouldn’t be doing, any government official, is there a process they can go to where they could make that known and express their concerns? COMEY: Yes. All of us, the intelligence community have robust whistleblower provisions that we educate our folks on and part of the whistleblower track is they can bring information to the appropriate committee of Congress. STEWART: That’s exactly right and are both of your agencies capable of handling accusations agree with me on that. I’d like to shift quickly if I could to the integrity of the report which the previous DNI when he determined along with your acquiescence, I might add, both of you, that Russia developed a clear preference for Mr. Trump and this is a huge deal. I mean, think about this story the American people have been told and some believe that our president was elected maybe because of the influence of a foreign government. And I love you guys, you know that, and I defend you and we respect what you do but I do need to make this point and that is the intelligence community is not perfect, is it? COMEY: Not perfect? STEWART: Yes. COMEY: Certainly not. STEWART: Certainly not. We. .. COMEY: I can speak for me, I don’t    he might be perfect. (LAUGHTER) STEWART: Mr. Rogers, I’ll allow you to answer the same question. ROGERS: I am not    same as the Director. STEWART: And as has been indicated here, and look again, that’s not a criticism, it’s just the human endeavor. We sometimes make mistakes as do agencies sometimes make mistakes and all of us can think of examples of that including meaningful mistakes, by the way. Mistakes that had clear implications for our policy. And as has been indicated here as well, there’s a difference in the level of confidence. Now, Mr. Comey, you have a higher degree of confidence in this report than you do, don’t you Mr. Rogers? ROGERS: To be specific, a different level of content on one specific assessment or judgment. .. STEWART: Understanding (ph). .. ROGERS: But a concurrent overall, in that judgment. STEWART: But that one judgment, that one is in a very important part of this report. And if I could make just this last point and this is an important point, I think. And that is the difficulty of determining motive. I mean, we can go back, we can look at facts. We can look at what happened. We can often determine who did it, who they did it with, when they did it. But to determine motive, you’ve got to crawl inside someone’s head. And that’s much, much more difficult. And in fact, quoting from the preamble in this report, talking about a leader’s intentions. It says, this objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand complex issues in which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to hide and obfuscate their activities. Once again, we’re trying to determine motive, which is very different    difficult. Do you agree with that? The determining motive is one of the most difficult challenges when it comes to an intelligence analysis? COMEY: I    I do Mr. Stewart. And I should    I should emphasize something that Admiral Rogers said earlier, we made no judgment on whether the Russians were successful in any way and having an impact on the election, I just wanna be clear. That    that’s not in report because we didn’t opine on it. We didn’t    that’s not within our    our. .. STEWART: I understand that, but we’re looking at Russian activities. And we’re making a conclusion of why they did that. In this case, that they preferred one    one candidate over the other. I was in Moscow last August. I came home and I did some media interviews and talked to some folks. And I said, they’re gonna mess with our elections. And that wasn’t based on any intelligence analyst or specific information, this was just based on history, we knew that they would. And I was always asked, well, who do they want to win? And I said then, I don’t think they care. I don’t think they A, could believe they could determine who would win and others (ph) as we’ve said here a number of times, they just want to break down the foundation, they just want to break the trust in our institutions. They want to take away that faith we have in our electoral process. And by the way, the intelligence community agreed with us, with me, on that analysis. For a long, long time, up until December. And then suddenly, they didn’t. And was when the president asked for this report and he asked for it to be concluded very quickly and then the analysis changed entirely. And    and it went from no, no, no, they don’t really care to no, no, they want Mr. Trump to win. And I think there’s another plausible explanation, which is what I want to talk about in the few minutes that I have remaining. Let me begin by asking you, do you think that the Russians expected Secretary Clinton to win the election? COMEY: Yes, as of August certainly, August, September. STEWART: OK. Mr. Rogers? ROGERS: Yes. STEWART: OK. Well, look, Mr. Comey you indicated as of August, September, do you believe they ever came to a conclusion that you know what? Mr. Trump’s going to win. COMEY: No, our    the assessment of the intelligence community was that early on, they thought he might have a shot. And so they wanted to mess with our election, hurt our country in general, that’s always the baseline. They hated her, Secretary Clinton, wanted to harm her and thought they might have a chance to help Mr. Trump. And then later, concluded that Mr. Trump was hopeless and they would focus then on just trying to undermine Secretary Clinton, especially with the European allies. STEWART: Got that, so up    up until summer and through the fall, they believe that Secretary Clinton would win, is that true? COMEY: I think the assessment was, late in the summer, they concluded based on the polling I think a lot of people were reading, that Mr. Trump didn’t have a chance. And they shifted to just focusing on just trying to undermine her. STEWART: And I tell you, if you were to tell me and I know you didn’t but I’m just saying, if anyone were to tell me that they concluded Mr. Trump is going to win. I’d just say they’re nuts, because there was no one in the world who thought that. Every media organization, every political organization, every government organization that I’m familiar with last fall thought that Secretary Clinton would be the next President of the United States. COMEY: I think the Russians agreed. STEWART: I    absolutely they did agree. Then this is the point and this is such a fine line, but it’s such an important point, and that is how can you know for certain if the Russians were motivated by hurting the person they thought in fact, fully expected was going to be the next President of the United States and comparing that with a mode (ph) of this kind of a Hail Mary pass. You know what, maybe this guy’s got a shot. Let’s try and help him get elected because those motives would be    and that’s    that’ again coming back to my original point, determining motives is very difficult. You have to either have very direct information or you have to be able to get inside someone’s head and really figure out what it is that’s driving them. And knowing the Russians expected Secretary Clinton to win, would you see that some of those things that they’ve done would be consistent with undermining her presidency, not necessarily because they thought Mr. Trump was going to win and they wanted help. COMEY: Again, I think it’s too close related sides of the same coin. I mean, to put it in a homely metaphor, I hate the New England Patriots and no matter who they play, I’d like them to lose. And so I’m at the same time rooting against the Patriots and hoping their opponent beats them. Because only two teams on the field but what the intelligence community concluded was early on, the hatred for Mrs. Clinton was    was all the way along. When Mr. Trump became the nominee, there was some sense that it’d be great if he could win, be great if we could help him. But we need to hurt her to matter what and then it shifted to he has no chance so let’s just focus on undermining her. That was the judgment of the intelligence community. ROGERS: Well, I’d also if I could highlight, I acknowledge the challenge at times about trying to understand intent, but the level    we’re not going to go in any specifics in an open unclassified forum. But the level of sourcing, the multiple sources we had, which were able to independently corroborate the judgment. And there’s a reason why we were high confidence in everything, except just one issue. STEWART: Yeah. ROGERS: To include the intent. STEWART: I understand. I spent some time out at the CIA last week. I went    was with the staff as best we could, through the 2000 some odd pages and by the way, not many people did. And some people are casting, you know, aspirations (ph) and not making the effort to go out there and actually look at that. But I’m telling you that having done that, I think a reasonable person could say what I’ve said here today, that there is another    another element to this. That there is another, as you said Mr. Comey, another side of the coin. And this is a very, very difficult to, in my opinion, thing to say with high levels of confidence. Which is why, once again the intelligence community isn’t perfect sometimes. And we do make mistakes. And Mr. Chairman, I yield back. I’d like to come back for just a few minutes if we could after. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. Mr. Schiff’s recognized. SCHIFF: Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow up questions by myself and Mr. Himes and then we’ll go to Mr. Castro. Director, you were asked about the Director Clapper’s comments and I think your response indicated that they were correct as far as the unclassified intelligence assessment goes. COMEY: Yes. I understood the question to be about the report itself. SCHIFF: I want to make it clear to people though the intelligence assessment    the unclassified intelligence assessment doesn’t discuss the issue of U. S. person coordination with the Russians. And I assume that’s because at the time of the report in January of this year that was under an investigation that you have now disclosed, is that right? COMEY: Correct. The counterintelligence investigation is the FBI’s business. The IC report was about what the intelligence community had about what Russia had done. So there is nothing in the report about coordination writing like that. It’s a separate responsibly the FBI to try and understand that, investigate it and    and assess it. SCHIFF: So we shouldn’t read Mr. Clapper’s comments as suggesting that he takes a different view of whether you had sufficient    sufficiently credible information and evidence to initiate a FBI counterintelligence investigation. COMEY: I don’t know exactly what he meant. All I can say is what    what the fact is which as we just laid out. There’s the report and then there’s our investigation. SCHIFF: And the report doesn’t cover the investigation? COMEY: Correct. SCHIFF: Mr. Himes? HIMES: Thank you, Mr. Schiff. Gentlemen, in my original questions to you, I asked you whether the intelligence community had undertaken any sort of study to determine whether Russian interference had had any influence on the electoral process and I think you told me the answer was    was no. COMEY: Correct. ROGERS: Correct, we said the U. S. intelligence community does not do analysis or reporting on the U. S. political process or U. S. public opinion, that is not our. .. (CROSSTALK) HIMES: OK. So thanks to the modern technology that’s in front of me right here, I’ve got a tweet from the president an hour ago, saying the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process so that’s not quite accurate, that tweet? COMEY: I’m sorry, I haven’t been following anybody on Twitter while I’ve been sitting here. .. HIMES: I can read it to you. It says the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence electoral    the electoral process. This tweet has gone out to millions of Americans, 16. 1 million to be exact. Is the tweet, as I read it to you, the NSA and FBI tell Congress that Russia did not influence the electoral process. Is that accurate? COMEY: Well, it’s hard for me to react to that, let me just tell you what we understand the    the state of what we’ve said is. We’ve offered no opinion, have no view, have no information on potential impact because it’s never something that we looked at. HIMES: OK. So it’s not too far of a logical leap to conclude that your    that the assertion that you have told the Congress that there was no influence on the electoral process is not quite right? COMEY: Right, it wasn’t    it certainly wasn’t our intention to say that today because we don’t have any information on that subject. And that’s not something that was looked at. HIMES: Right. Admiral Rogers, before I    before I yield back to the ranking member, there’s another tweet that says NSA Director Rogers tells Congress unmasking individuals endangers national security. My understanding was, as a member of the committee, that there is a lengthy and very specific process for the unmasking but that it does not inherently in of itself endanger national security. ROGERS: I assume the comment is designed to address the leaking of such information, but again, I    I have not read what you’re saying to me so I’m not in a position to comment on it, sir. HIMES: Thank you, I’ll yield back to the ranking member. SCHIFF: Mr. Castro? CASTRO: Thank you. And thank you gentlemen for your service to the nation and for your testimony today. I wanna take a moment to turn the Christopher Steele dossier, which was first mentioned in the media just before the election and published in full by media outlets in January. My focus today is to explore how many claims within Steele’s dossier are looking more and more likely, as though they are accurate. First, let me ask you, can you describe who Christopher Steele is? COMEY: No, I’m not gonna comment on that. CASTRO: Are you investigating the claims made in the dossier? COMEY: I’m not gonna comment on that, Mr. Castro. CASTRO: OK. Well, the reputation of the author, Christopher Steele is a former accomplished British intelligence officer with a career built on following Russia is important. This is not someone who doesn’t know how to run a source and not someone without contacts. The allegations it raises about President Trump’s campaign aids connections to Russians, when overlaid with known established facts and timelines from the 2016 campaign are very revealing. So let’s begin. In general, as my colleagues have discussed before, is it true that a large number of oligarchs and wealthy businessman in Russia have profited from their continuing close relationships or cooperation with the Kremlin? ROGERS: Can you say that one more time sir. .. CASTRO: Sure. ROGERS: I want to make sure I understand. CASTRO: Have oligarchs and wealthy folks in Russia profited from their connection to the Kremlin? ROGERS: Yes. CASTRO: And, there are no free lunches in Russia. If you get wealthy under Putin, it’s because you support Putin and are expected to support him. Is that fair to say? ROGERS: I would assume there’s a perception of his banage (ph) but I would assume it also varies by the specifics and the particular. .. CASTRO: Sure. ROGERS: . .. individual and relationship we’re talking about. CASTRO: OK. But Putin never distrusts, he verifies, right? As a former KGB man, he wants to keep tabs on his wealthiest citizens, especially those that could ever pose a challenge to him. Is that right? ROGERS: I assume he maintains knowledge of the situation around him to include particular centers of influence within Russia. CASTRO: Thank you. So, is it likely that the Kremlin would accept or actively trade favors or other valuable or sensitive information, intelligence from foreign figures about Russian oligarch or wealthy businessmen living abroad? ROGERS: Is it possible? Yes, but again, it depends on the particulars of the situation. I don’t know that I would make a flat statement. .. CASTRO: But it’s certainly a possibility. ROGERS: It’s a possibility. CASTRO: OK. Well, the dossier definitely seems right on these points. A quid pro quo relationship seems to exist between the Trump campaign and Putin’s Russia. A July 19, 2016 entry for example asserts that Russians were receiving intel from Trump’s team on Russian oligarch and their families in the United States. An entry from June 20, 2016 states quote, ”Trump and his inner circle have accepted regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals,” which is something for something. A July 30 entry likewise states that a source close to the Trump campaign confirms a regular exchange with the Kremlin has existed for at least eight years, including intelligence being fed back to Russia on oligarch activities in the United States. Is it generally true that Moscow actively seeks and supports, whether through the oligarch, overt Russian officials or undeclared intelligence officers, sympathetic or cooperative foreign figures abroad, whether through business dealings or political backing or a combination of the two. COMEY: ( ) ROGERS: Generally, it’s a tactic we have seen over time, but again, I would caution us    we’re talking about very specific cases theoretically here and I’m not prepared to get into any of the specifics. CASTRO: And I know that my colleagues have touched upon this, but I think it’s important in the context of Christopher Steele’s dossier to bring it up again. So, my question is, is it likely or plausible that the Russians might seek out Americans for Moscow’s purposes. COMEY: It is one of the focuses of our counterintelligence mission to try to understand the ways in which they try to do that, that’s at the core of their intelligence gathering, is trying to coop recruits    Americans    to give them information. CASTRO: So, the dossier states in an entry dated August 10, 2016, that a quote ”Kremlin official involved in U. S. relations” suggested that Moscow might offer assistance to quote ”sympathetic U. S. actors.” Does this sound like a plausible tactic out of the Russian playbook? COMEY: I’m not going to comment on that, Mr. Castro. CASTRO: OK. Now, let’s get even more specific. Among the U. S. actors, this Kremlin official mentions a Carter Page and Michael Flynn, whom my colleagues have already discussed at length and which the dossier describes as quote ”examples of successes by the Kremlin official.” We know that Carter Page went to Moscow on July 7 to give a speech to the new economic school. We’re in possession of the slide deck from his speech there. And we know Carter Page obtained approval from the Trump camp from Trump campaign manager at the time, Corey Lewandowski, as reported in Politico, citing national security campaign official, J. D. Gordon. CASTRO: Now, let me ask you another question with respect to somebody else. Is it correct that Igor Sechin, the president of Russian oil giant, Rosneft, is a former member of Russian intelligence and a   aide and confident of Vladimir Putin. COMEY: Not going to answer that, Mr. Castro. CASTRO: In an October 18, 2016, entry, the dossier states that, during Page’s visit to Moscow, he met with Igor Senchin, offering, quote,”Page and Trump’s associate, the brokerage of up to 19 percent stake in Rosneft,” which Page conferring (ph) that, quote, ”If Trump were elected U. S. President, sanctions on Russia would be lifted.” And although fortunately the White House hasn’t been so naive as to (inaudible) unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia, it was widely reported that on January 27th of this year, Rosneft sold a 19. 5 percent stake in Rosneft in what Reuters calls, quote,”one of its biggest privatizations since the 1990s.” Furthermore, Reuters reported that, quote, ”Public records show the ownership structure of the    of the stake ultimately includes a Cayman Islands company whose beneficial owners cannot be traced.” What a coincidence. Is this the subject of your investigation? One of the subjects of your investigation? COMEY: Same answer. CASTRO: OK. COMEY: Meaning    meaning I’m not going to comment. CASTRO: I understand. So, let’s move to WikiLeaks for a moment, who played such a prominent role in the 2016 election. As has established before and reestablished at this hearing, WikiLeaks was at a minimum an unwitting pawn and, at a maximum, an active   of the Kremlin’s in publishing stolen DNC and senior Democratic officials’  . And so you agree this was done in order to offer Moscow some measure of separation as to mask its hand in having hacked and stolen the data in the first place, but so it could still have it publicly posted to inflict damage on the Clinton campaign? COMEY: Yes, I think that’s fair. ROGERS: Yes. CASTRO: OK. An entry from July 19, 2016, in the dossier states that a Trump associate knew that the Kremlin was using WikiLeaks in order to maintain quote, ”plausible deniability of its involvement.” Three days after this entry, WikiLeaks carries out the Kremlin’s wishes and publishes upwards of 20, 000 stolen DNC   and 8, 000 associated   attachments, and the rest, as they say, is history. Another entry dated August 17th has Carter Page and a Russian associate discussing WikiLeaks publishing   in order to swing Sanders’ supporters away from Clinton and to Trump. And again, from a September 14th entry in the dossier, quote, ”Kremlin has further compromising material on Clinton in form of   and considers disseminating after parliamentary elections in late September.” And on October 7th, WikiLeaks publishes John Podesta’s hacked  . So the coincidences keep piling up. Let’s turn, in the few minutes that I have remaining, again to Paul Manafort, as a   to Mr. Himes’ questioning. Suffice it to say, Paul Manafort was a major part of the Trump campaign, including serving as its chairman, convention manager, and chief strategist, before departing the campaign in disgrace in August 2016. It’s also established the fact that Paul Manafort was a   official adviser to   Ukrainian political leadership. Is Paul Manafort    Manafort a subject in your investigation? COMEY: I’m not going to comment on that. CASTRO: All right. Director, can you describe to the American people the Russian concept of kompromat? COMEY: It’s a technique that they use to gather information on people that may be embarrassing or humiliating, and using it to coerce cooperation. CASTRO: In your career, have you known instances where that has been successfully leveraged? COMEY: Yes, I believe our   division has encountered it a number of times. CASTRO: Does that include private places, including places such as hotels that are wired for audio and video? COMEY: I don’t think I remember enough about the particulars to say, but in theory, sure. CASTRO: Thank you. I yield back. I yield back to Ranking Member Schiff. SCHIFF: I recognize Mr. Heck. HECK: Admiral Rogers, before I get into my main body in my remarks, I want to go back to your earlier comment about that there is no evidence to indicate that there was a successful Russian hacking of voter results or tabulations. What I did not hear you say is whether or not there had been any attempts to hack into election systems of any kind. ROGERS: Yes. COMEY: I can answer that because the FBI’s responsibility’s in the United States. We saw no indication of that. We saw efforts to penetrate voter registration databases, state Boards of Elections, at that level. We saw no efforts aimed at the vote itself. HECK: But you did see efforts to penetrate registration roles? COMEY: Correct. HECK: Did you see efforts to penetrate any other portions of election systems, other than registrations? In this country it’s a   system and, as a consequence, you will recall,   of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, indicated that election systems should become a part of our critical infrastructure for cybersecurity purposes. COMEY: Their efforts were aimed at the voter registration systems in various states, and it takes different forms in various states. Sometimes there’s a private vendor, sometimes it’s state. But it    that’s where it was focused, and not on the    the vote itself, vote machines, vote tabulation, vote transmission, that we’ve seen. HECK: Thank you. I yield back to the Ranking Member (inaudible). SCHIFF: Time’s    time’s expired, but let me go quickly to Mr. Turner. TURNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There’s been a lot of statements that have been made up here that is opposed to questions. And we don’t certainly feel the need to clarify all of them, but there is one aspect that does need to be clarified because it’s also involved both of your testimonies. There’s been discussion up here concerning the statements by James Clapper and, rather than do the conjecture as it has been made, I’m going to just read it. Chuck Todd said, ”Let me ask you this. Does intelligence exist that can definitively answer the following question whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials?” James Clapper said, ”We did not include any evidence in our report. I say ’our,’ that’s NSA, FBI, and CIA, with my office and the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything, that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.” Chuck Todd followed up. ”I understand that, but does it exist?” James Clapper answered, ”Not to my knowledge.” So the text is not merely related to the report. I yield back. NUNES: Mr. Crawford’s recognized. CRAWFORD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here today. I’ll start with Director Comey. Despite your expressed disdain for the New England Patriots, I think that Tom Brady would probably like to express his gratitude for the FBI’s assistance in recovering his stolen Super Bowl jersey, so I’ll do that on his behalf now. COMEY: Thank you. By the way, I    if I’m honest with myself, the reason I don’t like the Patriots is they represent sustained excellence and, as a Giants’ fan, that drives me crazy. CRAWFORD: Director Comey, are you familiar with an article, July 18, 2016, from The Washington Post entitled ”Trump Campaign Guts GOP’s   Stance on Ukraine”? COMEY: I’m not familiar with that article. I don’t    I don’t remember it. CRAWFORD: I’d ask (you) now to consent to add this to the record, just for your edification, Director. There’s an allegation contained in that article that at a National Security Committee platform meeting Trump staffers wrote an amendment to an amendment that stripped out platform’s call    call for providing, quote,”Lethal defensive weapons,” and replace it with softer language, calling for, quote, ”Appropriate assistance.” Are you familiar with a March 18, 2017, story in the Washington Examiner entitled ”How Pundits Got Key Parts of the Trump Russia Story All Wrong”? Are you familiar with that? COMEY: I don’t think I am. CRAWFORD: I’d ask you now to consent to add that to the record, and also for your edification I’ll go to some of the    the meat of that story. There    are you aware of an allegation that Trump staffers gutted the Ukraine plank of the platform? COMEY: Am I aware of the article on that? CRAWFORD: Are you aware of any    anything of that nature, the article or any    any activity that    that (inaudible)? COMEY: Do you want to talk about anything    I’m willing to comment on whether I’ve seen different things in the media. I don’t want to talk about anything beyond that. CRAWFORD: OK. So, then, say you’re not aware of the final platform that retained all of the language from the original platform, plus the portion of the amendment offered by the platform committee member? COMEY: I don’t want to comment. CRAWFORD: OK. Then I’ll go through    I know that you’re limited on what you comment on. I’ll go through some of the    some of the    as I said, the meat of this. Reading from the platform, it says, quote, ”We will meet the return of Russian belligerence with the same resolve that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. We will not accept any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force in Ukraine or elsewhere, and we’ll use all appropriate measures to bring to justice the practitioners of aggression and assassination,” end quote. Does that sound to you as a    like a   or a   statement, in your assessment? COMEY: That’s not for me to comment on. CRAWFORD: OK. Further, in the platform it says quote ”We support maintaining and if warranted increasing sanctions together with our allies against Russia and less and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. We also support providing appropriate assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and greater coordination with NATO defense planning.” And again, that sounds like fairly clear language in their relationship to Russia. Would you agree? COMEY: Same answer Mr. Crawford. CRAWFORD: OK, thank you. The final language I’ll get to here in just a second    there was    there was an amendment but the final language regarding that plank of a platform with regard to national security relating to Russia. It says ”we support maintaining and if warranted, increasing sanctions together with our allies against Russia and less and until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully restored. We also support providing appropriate assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and greater coordination with NATO defense planning.” And again, that    to me that sounds fairly clear and straightforward that that is not conducive to a Putin administration. Would you agree? COMEY: Give you the same answer, Mr. Crawford. CRAWFORD: Thank you, sir. It’s also important to note that that platform was adopted in coordination with and in concert with the Trump administration as they met at the convention and they went through the platform process. The Trump campaign agreed to the platform condemning Kremlin belligerence, calling for continued and perhaps increased sanctions against Russia as I indicated in the text of that platform. For the full restoration of Ukrainian territory, for refusing to accept quote ”any territorial change in Eastern Europe imposed by force, Ukraine or elsewhere and pledging to aid Ukraine’s armed forces.” So I    I bring that up just to    just to highlight and note the fact that none of that appears to be   or   language. NUNES: Mr. Crawford, will you yield that to me? CRAWFORD: Yes. NUNES: So, Mr. Comey, I just want to make sure    I know you’re not going to comment on this, but I hope that you’ll take this back to your investigators because there seems to be the    the line out there that somehow the Republican Party watered down it’s platform. And that’s not true. That didn’t happen, and in fact, what happened is    is that the platform was actually increased. Increased its certainty against what the Russians were up to and it actually amended the platform to make it stronger than what it initially was. So, you know, I know there’s a lot of circumstantial evidence out there about all these supposed people that knew    that knew the Russians, but the reality is and remains the case, Republican Party had a very strong platform that was against the Russians and it was increased in its    its strength not decreased like has been reported. So I know that you won’t comment, but I hope that at least you will    we’ll provide this to your investigative team so that we can at least get this off the table. Will you    will you take this back? COMEY: Sure. NUNES: OK, we’ll give it to you. Sorry, Mr. Crawford. We’ll go back. CRAWFORD: Not at all. Thank you, Mr. Comey, I appreciate that. Admiral Rogers, would you like to make a comment about the New England Patriots before I move forward? ROGERS: I’m a Chicago Bears guy, born and (inaudible). CRAWFORD: Admiral, our employees    you mentioned this before but I just want to go through this list. Are employees of intelligence community    intelligence community agencies required to disclose visits with foreign nationals? ROGERS: Yes, broadly, although I’d be the first to admit not all foreign international interactions are the same. Interactions with the British, for example, are in a very different place than other countries for example. CRAWFORD: OK, appreciate that clarification. To your knowledge, are elected officials required to disclose contact with foreign nationals? ROGERS: I don’t know what the specifics are across the federal government because clearly in many jobs, that’s part    interaction with foreign counterparts is part of your job. I’m the first to acknowledge that. I interact with foreign counterparts as does Director Comey, regularly, in the course of our duties. CRAWFORD: Are federal campaign employees required to disclose contacts with foreign nationals to your knowledge? ROGERS: I apologize, I just don’t know. CRAWFORD: OK. Are private citizens required in any way to disclose or to report contact with foreign nationals? That you know of? ROGERS: I don’t know. CRAWFORD: Is it customary for transition teams for a presidential campaign    for transition team members to meet with foreign nationals to your knowledge? Is that customary? ROGERS: It’s an area I just don’t have any knowledge. CRAWFORD: Is that unusual? ROGERS: I don’t have any    I don’t have any knowledge on it. CRAWFORD: Has it happened before? ROGERS: I’ve never been part of a transition team. I don’t know. CRAWFORD: Are transition team members required by law to disclose contacts with foreign nationals? ROGERS: I apologize, I don’t know the law there. CRAWFORD: Thank you. I yield back to the Chairman. NUNES: Thank you Mr. Crawford. Ms. Stefanik’s recognized. STEFANIK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Director Comey and Admiral Rogers for your testimony today. My first set of questions are directed at Director Comey. Broadly, when the FBI has any open   investigation, what are the typical protocols or procedures for notifying the DNI, the White House, and senior Congressional leadership? COMEY: There is a practice of a quarterly briefing on sensitive cases to the chair and ranking of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. And the reason I hesitate is, thanks to feedback we’ve gotten, we’re trying to make it better. And that involves a briefing of the Department of Justice, I believe the DNI, and the    some portion of the National Security Council at the White House. .. STEFANIK: So if that’s quarterly. .. COMEY: . .. to brief them before Congress is briefed. STEFANIK: So it’s quarterly for all three then, senior congressional leadership, the White House, and the DNI? COMEY: I think that’s right. Now that’s by practice not by rule or by written policy which is why, thanks to the chair and ranking giving us feedback, we’re trying to tweak it in certain ways. STEFANIK: So since, in your opening statement, you confirmed that there is a   investigation currently open and you also referenced that it started in July. When did you notify the DNI, the White House, or senior congressional leadership? COMEY: It’s a good question. Congressional leadership, some time recently. They were briefed on the nature of the investigation in some detail as I said. Obviously the Department of Justice has been aware of it all along. The DNI, I don’t know what the DNI’s knowledge of it was because we didn’t have a DNI until Mr. Coats took office and I briefed him his first morning in office. STEFANIK: So just to drill down on this, if    if the open investigation began in July and the briefing of congressional leadership only occurred recently, why was there no notification prior to the recent    to the past month? COMEY: I think our decision was it was a matter of such sensitivity that we wouldn’t include it in the quarterly briefings. STEFANIK: So when you state our decision is that your decision? Is that usually your decision what gets briefed in those quarterly updates? COMEY: No, it’s usually the decision of the head of our   intelligence division. STEFANIK: And just again, to get the detailed    on the record, why was the decision made not to brief senior congressional leadership until recently when the investigation had been open since July? A very serious investigation    why was that decision to wait months? COMEY: Because of the sensitivity of the matter. STEFANIK: Stepping back more broadly, in the case of Russia, we know that cyber hacking is just one tactic that’s typically part of a broader influence or information warfare campaign and we know the Russian government is ready and willing to employee hacking as but one of many tools in their toolkit to obtain information for use against the United States. Is there any evidence that Russia tried to hack other entities associated with the 2016 presidential campaign in addition to the DNC or the Clinton campaign operatives? COMEY: Yes, many others. STEFANIK: Can you specify those others? Did that include the RNC? Did that include any of the other campaigns of candidates in the primaries, either Democrats or Republicans? COMEY: I think what we can say in an unclassified setting is what we have in the report that there were efforts to penetrate organizations associated with the Republican party and that    I think that is what we said in the report. And that there were not releases of material taken    hacked from any Republican associated organizations. STEFANIK: But the hacking    the use of cyber tools as part of their broader, whether you call it hybrid warfare or information warfare campaigns, it was done to both parties. COMEY: Correct. STEFANIK: Thank you. Taking a further step back of what’s been in the news recently, and I’m referring to the Yahoo! hack, the Yahoo! data breech, last week the Department of Justice announced that it was charging hackers with ties to the FSB in the 2014 Yahoo! data breech. Was this hack done to your knowledge for intelligence purposes? COMEY: I can’t say in this forum. STEFANIK: Press reporting indicates that Yahoo! hacked targeted journalists, dissidence and government officials. Do you know what the FSB did with the information they obtained? COMEY: Same answer. STEFANIK: OK, I understand that. How    how did the administration determine who to sanction as part of the election hacking? How    how familiar with that decision process and how is that determination made? COMEY: I don’t know. I’m not familiar with the decision process. The FBI is a factual input but I don’t recall and I don’t have any personal knowledge of how the decisions are made about who to sanction. STEFANIK: Looking forward    and this is for both of you    what is the NSA and the FBI doing to keep Americans safe, to keep campaign entities    to keep any entity associated with a major campaign, save from aggressive Russia cyber measures that were utilized in this past election? ROGERS: So, we continue to maximize the insights. We’re generating about an activity    for example, this started with the NSA initially gaining access, in the summer of ’15, we became aware of that activity, shared it with our FBI teammates. That continues, we try to make sure that the insights we generate our shared with our law enforcement teammates, who then   with the private sector. We’re trying to work broadly across the U. S. government to increase cybersecurity, as you heard discussed      discussions about what’s the role of the voting infrastructure in the United States, in terms of critical infrastructure. Do we need to bring that within the critical infrastructure framework? I know that topic has been ongoing for some period of time. STEFANIK: Director Comey? COMEY: Yeah, I think that’s right and just making sure that we are sharing information when we get it that someone’s being hit, but more importantly we’re showing people what we’ve learned from this cycle, so they can tighten up. STEFANIK: Thank you. It seems to me in my first line of questioning, the more serious a counterintelligence investigation is. That would seem to trigger a need to update not just the White House, the DNI, but also Senior Congressional Leadership. And you stated, it was due to the severity. I think moving forward, it seems that the most severe and serious investigations should be notified to the Senior Congressional Leadership. And with that, thanks for the lenience, Chairman, I yield back. (CROSSTALK) COMEY: That’s good feedback, Ms. Stefanik. The challenge for us is sometimes we want to keep it tight within the executive branch, and if we’re going to go brief congressional leaders, the practice has been, then we brief inside the executive branch. And so, we have to figure out how to navigate that in a good way. NUNES: We may have to update the law on that. Gentlelady (ph) yields back. Mr. Schiff is recognized for 15 minutes and I think    then we’ll come back to our side for 15 and that should be it. SCHIFF: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of questions before I hand it back to Mr. Heck. Do the Russians favor the United States provision of lethal, defensive weapons to Ukraine, Admiral? ROGERS: No. SCHIFF: They would strongly oppose such an idea, would they not? ROGERS: They’ve been opposed to it to date. SCHIFF: And I can tell you that the idea of providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine has bipartisan support here on the Hill, including Senator McCain, certainly myself, I would imagine many members of this committee. There was an effort at the convention to strengthen the platform by including a provision that would provide lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine. That was defeated. The campaign manager for the Trump campaign at the time, Paul Manafort, denied the campaign was involved in defeating that amendment. But the delegate who offered the amendment later disclosed to the press that in fact it was dropped at the insistence of the Trump campaign. J. D. Gordon, a national security adviser for the Trump campaign was forced later to admit that in fact, he had weighed in against the amendment that would have provided that the U. S. should give lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine. So, I would join my chairman in asking you to look into this, particularly since we know that Ambassador Kislyak attended the convention and if there was any communication between the Russians and the Trump campaign, that had the effect any coordination that resulted in the defeat of an amendment that was against Russian interests, the committee would certainly like to know and we welcome that inquiry. Mr. Heck? HECK: Thank you, Ranking Member. There a lot of emotions kicking around in this room today. I perceive anger and outrage and subdued somberness, one I feel overwhelmingly is sadness. We’ve heard nothing but terribly disturbing evidence of what has happened to our country at the hands of arguably our greatest advisory. And what’s worse, the evidence we’ve heard so far all seems    all seems to lead to the conclusion that they help from the inside. That this was, in part, an inside job from U. S. persons    willing American accomplices or terribly naive ones, or probably both    who helped the Russians attack our country and our democracy. We’re both still at the early stages of our investigation. We’re not indicting anyone, merely laying out some of the evidence and the facts, dirty though they be, sleazy though they be. And no matter what, we can safely conclude at this point that never in the modern era has a President and his Administration had so many foreign entanglements. Entanglements that continue to push American foreign policy away from its core roots    beliefs, interests and alliances towards unprecedented positions that only Putin himself could approve of. How else can we explain the modification to the Republican Party platform in such a decidedly   way. Republicans who are always so strong against geopolitical foes like Russia, I know my colleagues on this committee take the Russia threat very seriously. Why wouldn’t the people who inhabit the White House? How else can we explain an Administration that beats up our oldest allies, like Australia and Britain, and our strongest and most sacrosanct alliance, like NATO, but never, ever say a bad word about Putin. In fact, they say a lot of good words about Putin. An administration that we have heard decisively makes up baseless wiretapping charges against a former United States President, equates our intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany, and argues moral equivalents between a repressive, authoritarian states with an abhorrent human rights record like Russia in our free and open democracy. And yet, this Administration never, ever utters any criticism of Russia. Let’s be clear though. This is not about party. It’s not about relitigating the election. It’s not as if anything we do here will put a President from a different political party in the Oval Office. So, I hope that it’s clear that it’s about something much more important. And no, it’s not about political motivation, to my friend who said and suggested that earlier, this is about patriotism, about something way more important than party. This is about country and the very heart of what this country is built on, which is open, free, fair, trusted elections. We don’t take our investigation lightly and I know you don’t. Indeed, you go through a process to even decide to do that, whether to extend the resources, to begin with credible allegations and reason to believe that there’s something that warrants it. And I no doubt believe you’ve talked to lawyers in and out of the prosecution divisions about whether or not this warrants an investigation. I know you don’t take this lightly. What we have seen is damning evidence today of what Russia did. We’ve also seen damning evidence of how they did it. Russia has a history of using active measures, many of which we have heard about today. Let’s recap them, we’re getting near the end. Hacking and dumping information to damage or embarrass their enemies. We heard about this, of course, with respect to WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2. 0. Using   and cutouts, business people, oligarchs (ph) and other ostensibly private individuals to cultivate relationships. We’ve discussed Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, CEO Igor Sechin, and of course, Vladimir Putin himself. We’re also heard about Russia’s use of companies like (inaudible) the Bank of Cyprus, (inaudible) and a confusing web of offshore shell companies used it would seem to hide or to launder money. We’ve also heard how Russia released disinformation to spread rumors and confused the public and to sow distrust and the ability to even know truth objectively, using propaganda, media outlets, whether they’re owned directly by Russia or not, to release such disinformation in order to claim plausible deniability of Russia’s hands. Here again, we see WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2. 0, but we also see the use of propaganda outlets like RT. And of course, the use of U. S. persons of influence. Whether through active collision or coordination or naive acquiescence, we don’t yet know the full extent to further Russia’s attempts to undermine our elections and ultimately, weaken our democracy. HECK: On that last point, we’ve heard about quite a few individuals in the Trump orbit who feel somewhere on that spectrum from mere naivete, disturbing enough if this naivete is a feature of those who are supposed to be running our country and foreign policy, to unwitting Russian dupes, to willing blindness, to active coordination. This rogues galleries includes those already fired    Roger Stone, adviser to Donald Trump; Paul Manafort, adviser to Donald Trump; Michael Flynn, national security adviser to Donald Trump; Carter Page, adviser to Donald Trump. But the cloud of deep suspicion in Russian entanglements extends to those still in power. Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State to Donald Trump; Michael Caputo, adviser to Donald Trump; Jeff Sessions, Attorney General for Donald Trump; and members of the Trump family itself. This matters. It’s serious. Our battleships weren’t sunk and our towers didn’t collapse a la 2011 (sic). But make no mistake, 2016 is a year that we should mark on our calendars, and it’s still going on. The attack didn’t end on Election Day. And it will continue as you have suggested unless we, all of us in this room, stop it. Admiral Rogers, you’ve proudly worn that uniform your entire career. I am proud of your service and grateful for it. But I would ask you, sir, not even with respect to this specific investigation, to use your own words as someone who no doubt has been in theater, who’s lost brothers and sisters in combat, to explain to me, but more importantly to the American people    don’t assume they know the answer. Tell them in your words why we should care about Russia’s active measures campaign aimed as destabilizing our democracy and that of our allies. In your words, sir, why should they care? ROGERS: I don’t think it’s best interests of our nation for any external entity to attempt to manipulate outcomes, to shape choices. That should be the inherent role of a democracy. The investigation we’re going through I think is a positive in the sense it will help illuminate to all of us, regardless of party, what are the implications here and what does it mean for us. Because I think our conclusion and that of the intelligence community broadly here is, this absent some change, this behavior is not likely to stop. Absent some change in the dynamic, this is not likely to be the last time we’ll be having these discussions about that kind of activity. I don’t think that’s in anybody’s best interest for us as a nation. HECK: Director Comey, parallel question. Again, in general terms, not with respect to the specific investigation you have revealed here today, not asking you to go into specifics on any individuals, but please, explain briefly to me, and more importantly to the American public, why we should care about Russia’s use of U. S. persons of Americans helping Russia destabilize our democracy. COMEY: Well, like Admiral Rogers, I truly believe we are shining city on a hill, to quote a great American. And one of the things we radiate to the world is the importance of our wonderful, often messy, but free and fair Democratic system and the elections that undergird (ph) it. And so when there’s something by a foreign nation state to mess with that, to destroy that, to corrupt that, it’s very, very serious, threatens what is America. And if any Americans are part of that effort, it’s a very serious matter. And so you would expect the FBI to want to understand, is that so? And if so, who did what? But again, I want to be very careful to people who over0interpret my words, to preserve our ability to answer those questions, we’re not talking about our work. I’m not here voluntarily. Right? I would rather not be talking about this at all. But we thought it was important to share at least that much with the committee and the American people, and now we’re going to close our mouths to do our work to see if we can answer those questions, because the answers matter. HECK: They do indeed. I thank you both for those answers. And I thank you both for your service to our country. I would like to think that we can turn this from a sad event into a positive one. This country has stood up and fought on behalf of its own health and welfare and that of its citizens and met any number of challenges throughout our nation’s history. The worst thing we could do is underestimate the nature of this challenge before us today. HECK: With that, ranking member, I would appreciate it if I could yield to my friend from Texas, Mr. Castro, briefly. SCHIFF: Mr. Castro. CASTRO: I thank you. One more question with respect to Lee (ph) because I know that’s been a big topic of the line of questioning and of course is a concern to all of us. Regardless of political party. But I want to ask you director, is it possible that some of those leaks could come from not the intelligence community, but from members of the White House staff for example? COMEY: Sure it could come from lots of different places. And it’s often one of the things that is challenging as I said about a leak investigation. You think it’s going to be a small circle, but it turns out a lot of people either knew about it, or heard echoes of it and it’s stories to tell to journalists about it. So in my experience trying to figure these things out for decades, it’s often coming from places you didn’t anticipate. CASTRO: No and the reason I asked the question is because the President has berated the FBI and the intelligence community on the issue of leaks. And others have berated the intelligence community in the press because of these leaks. But I think it’s worth considering that it’s quite possible that there are folks who have a kind of political Munchausen by proxy syndrome, where they leak information because they want to be the savior once it blows up. You know they’re all sorts of individual’s that serve on political staff and I think that we ought to consider the possibility that perhaps it is somebody at the White House. Thank you. I yield back. NUNES: (inaudible). The gentleman yields back. The gentleman yields back to Mr. Hurd. HURD: Thank you, Chairman. And gentlemen, thank you all for being here. And thank you for your continued service to your country. I’ve learned recently the value of sitting in one place for a long period of time and listening and today I’m has added to that understanding and I’m going to try to ask questions that y’all can answer in this format and are within your areas of expertise. And Director Rogers, my first question to you    the exploit that was used by the Russian’s to penetrate the DNC, was it sophisticated? Was it a zero day exploit? A zero day being some type of    for those that are watching, an exploit that has never been used before? ROGERS: In an open unclassified forum, I am not going to talk about Russian tactics, techniques or procedures about how they executed their hacks. HURD: If members of the DNC had not    let me rephrase this, can we talk about spear fishing? ROGERS: Sure, in general terms, yes sir. HURD: Spear fishing is when somebody sends an email and they    somebody clicks on something in that email. .. ROGERS: Right, the user of things (inaudible) they’re receiving an email either of interest or from a legitimate user, they open it up and they’ll often click if you will on a link    an attachment. HURD: Was that type of tactic used in the. .. ROGERS: Again, I’m not in an unclassified forum just not going to be. .. HURD: Copy, I apologize. Director Comey, when was the first time the FBI notified the DNC of the hack? Roughly. COMEY: I think august of 2015. HURD: And was that prior to information being leaked to    being sent on    put on WikiLeaks? COMEY: Yes the    the first Russian directed releases where middle of June of the next year by D. C. leaks and this Guccifer 2. 0 persona and then that was followed by Wikileaks. So about a year. A little less than a year really. HURD: So there was about a year between the FBI’s first notification of some potential problems with the DNC network and then that information getting on    getting on Wikileaks. COMEY: Yes, sir. HURD: Have you been able to    when did the DNC provide access for    to the FBI for your technical folks to review what happened? COMEY: Well we never got direct access to the machines themselves. The DNC in the spring of 2016 hired a firm that ultimately shared with us their forensics from their review of the system. HURD: Director Rogers, did the NSA ever get access to the DNC hardware? ROGERS: The NSA didn’t ask for access. That’s not in our job. .. HURD: Good copy. So director FBI notified the DNC early, before any information was put on Wikileaks and when    you have still been    never been given access to any of the technical or the physical machines that were    that were hacked by the Russians. COMEY: That’s correct although we got the forensics from the pros that they hired which    again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this    my folks tell me was an appropriate substitute. HURD: The    at what point did the company and the DNC use    share that forensic information to you? COMEY: I don’t remember for sure. I think June. I could be wrong about that. ROGERS: The company went public in June of 16, with their conclusions. I would assume it was around that time. COMEY: I think it was about the time    I think it was a little bit before the announcement, but I’ll say approximately June. HURD: So    so that was    how long after the first notification of    that the FBI did of the DNC? COMEY: Ten months. HURD: Ten months? So the FBI notified the DNC of the hack and it was not until 10 months later that you had any details about what was actually going on forensically on their network? COMEY: That’s correct, assuming I have the dates about right. But it was    it was some months later. HURD: Knowing what we know now, would the FBI have done anything different in trying to notify the DNC of what happened? COMEY: Oh Sure. HURD: What    what    what measures would you have done differently? COMEY: We’d have set up a much larger flare. Yeah we’d have just kept banging and banging on the door, knowing what I know now. We made extensive efforts to notify, we’d have    I might have walked over there myself, knowing what I know now. But I think the efforts we made, that are agents made were reasonable at the time. HURD: Good copy. And do you have a ball park of the number of private sector entities that you have to notify of these types of breaches? COMEY: Hundreds and thousands. In this particular case we had to notify hundreds, I think maybe more than 1, 000 entities that the Russians were hitting at the same time. HURD: Admiral Rogers, do you have anything to add to that? ROGERS: No, because as we pass the information to the FBI, what started all this was a pretty massive effort on the part of our Russian counterparts. HURD: I’ve said this many times. The outcome of grizzly staff (ph) what the intelligence community as the Russian hacking, has been the wedge, whether real or perceived between the executive branch, the intelligence community and the public. And this is an asymmetrical tool, that the Russians are using to destabilize liberal democratic institutions. And I think it is important that we do everything we can to review this, which I fully believe federal law enforcement, is doing as y’all have talked to here. And I would like to end before yielding back to the chairman, that my colleague from California, the Ranking Member said in his opening statement, the question that most people have is whether we can really conduct this investigation, in the kind of thorough nonpartisan manner that the seriousness of the issues merit, or whether the enormous political consequences of our work will make that impossible. And he adds, the truth is, I don’t know the answer. I do. We must. The American people demand this. The future of our democratic institutions demand it and I’m glad we have two people like y’all involved in this. Mr. Chairman I yield back my time to you. NUNES: Gentleman yields back. And Mr. Gowdy’s got a follow up. GOWDY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman I want to thank you and Ranking Member Schiff for having this. Here Mr. Chairman you were talking about Russia far before it became    long before it became fashionable to talk about Russia. If memory serves me correctly, you referred to Russia as possibly our greatest national security threat post  . And as you know Chairman I come from a state with a fellow name Graham, who is also no fan of Russia. So Director Comey, Admiral Rogers, people in your line of work are incredibly respected both your current line of work and the work that you came from and people in my line of work are not and there’s a reason. The justice system is respected and the political process is not. So this is    while this hearings important. What’s really important is what you do after this hearing. GOWDY: And I want you to go find every single witness who may have information about interference, influence, motive, our response, collusion, coordination, whatever your jurisdiction is, wherever the facts may take you, though the heavens may fall, go do your jobs because nature abhors a vacuum. And right now you can’t answer most of the questions, either by policy, by law, or because the investigation has not been complete. Therefore, a vacuum exists which people in my line of work are more than happy to fill. So I need you to fill. I need you to do it with all deliberate speed. Director Comey, I think it’s also important for my fellow citizens to take note of why the system that you come from, the one that I come from, is respected, and this system that I’m in now is not. What is hearsay? COMEY: Information you don’t know of your own personal knowledge but learn from someone else. GOWDY: It’s an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. COMEY: I was trying to be a little less lawyerly. GOWDY: All right. Well, we’ll go with your answer. And it is almost never admissible in court. How about anonymous sources? When you were in the southern district could you ever call on an anonymous source to testify in one of your proceedings? COMEY: No. GOWDY: You couldn’t even use hearsay, unless there was some widely accepted exception. It would never    a newspaper article would never, ever be admitted as evidence in a courtroom. So the system we respect would laugh you out of court if you came in armed with a newspaper article. But in the political process, that’s enough. Let me ask you this. Cross examination. Why are you able to cross examine witnesses in trial? Why do we have a right to confront witnesses? COMEY: Well, it’s embedded in our Constitution, and the reason it makes great sense is, it’s the crucible out of which you get truth. GOWDY: It is the single best way to elucidate the truth    to test and to probe and to challenge, and to test someone’s personal exposure to the facts. Cross examination’s the best tool that we have. How do you cross examine an anonymous source? How do you cross examine hearsay? I hope that you go find every single witness that you need to talk to, and examine every single document. People are counting on you two and your line of work to find the facts. And people are welcome to draw whatever conclusions they want from the facts. But when I hear the word evidence, as I’ve heard lots and lots this morning, let me ask you this, Director Comey, did you ever    are you familiar with any trials where one witness may have said the light was red and one witness may have said the light was green? Has that ever happened? COMEY: Yes, that’s why you have a trial. GOWDY: Does it ever happen where one bank teller said the assailant was 5’10” and one said the assailant was 6’2”? COMEY: Sure. GOWDY: So that’s evidence. You’ve got evidence he’s 6’2” and evidence he’s 5’11” he just can’t be both. The light can’t be red and green. So the word evidence, while fancy and legal, the reality is you find facts and then the finder of the fact can draw conclusions and inferences from those facts. So I wish you luck as you begin this process. It is all important. The fact that someone may have had a line of questions about leaks does not mean that they’re not interested in all aspects of Russia. And vice versa, the fact that they may not have asked questions about leaks doesn’t mean they’re not interested in them. You have jurisdiction over all of it. So, God bless you as you go on this journey for the facts. And then people can draw whatever conclusions they want. I hope that you will fill (ph) the vacuum that is created when you all are not able to answer questions. With that, I will yield back to the chairman. NUNES: The gentleman yields back. Mr. Comey, this is my final list of questions here. I just want to make sure we get this on the record. Do you have any evidence that any current Trump White House or administration official coordinated with the Russian intelligence services? COMEY: Not a question I can answer. NUNES: I figured you were going to say that, but I just wanted to make sure we got it on the record. How about counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway? COMEY: It’s the same answer. And as I said earlier, I constantly want to ask people, don’t over interpret the fact that I say I can’t comment. I’m not going to comment on anybody. NUNES: Well, I think    I understand that. But here’s the challenge. Is that you’ve announced that you have this big investigation, but now you’ve got people that are involved in our government that are    the Secretary of State, for example    these are important players. And the longer this hangs out here, the bigger the cloud is. And I know that you’re not going to tell me whether or not you have any evidence, but I can tell you that we don’t have any evidence. And we’re conducting our own investigation here, and if you have some    if you have evidence I’d    especially as it relates to people in the White House that are working in the White House or the administration, I mean, that would be something that we really should know about and we should know about quickly. And so if you can’t give it to the entire committee, I hope you can at least give it myself and Mr. Schiff because you know, there is a big gray cloud that you have put over people who have very important work to do to lead this country. And so the faster you can get to the bottom of this, it’s going to be better for all Americans. COMEY: I understand. Thank you. NUNES: All right. With that, I want to thank the members today and especially our witnesses. It was a long day, but I think a good discussion.

"         President Trump spoke with Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in an interview airing Wednesday morning, and it was par for the course for Trump. By which I mean he rewrote history (on his views of attacking Syria) offered some cryptic comments (about FBI Director James Comey’s job) and appeared to completely reverse course on strategy (saying he now wants to finish   reform before tax reform). He even appeared to brag about striking Syria while eating dessert with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Below is the full transcript, with the key parts highlighted and analyzed. To see an annotation, click on the yellow parts.  TRUMP: Well, look, you know because you cover it.  We’ve done an amazing job on regulations.  We’ve freed it up.  We freed up this country so much, the miners and energy and the banking system is now coming, too, with   which is a disaster. We freed up so much and we’re getting great, great credit for it.  We have done so much for so many people.  I don’t think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anyone has done nearly what we’ve been able to do. And on top of it, we just had  —   during the first 100 days, a Supreme Court justice approved, not just nominated, but approved through a very, very hostile environment. We have thousands of jobs all across the country. Look at what’s going on in Michigan with the expansion of the plants by Ford, by General Motors, yesterday Toyota announced that they’re going to spend $1. 3 to $1. 9 billion in Kentucky. And different things.  I mean the car industry is not going to leave us anymore, believe me.  The car industry is staying in our country.  They were leaving  —   if I didn’t win this election, you would have lost your car industry to Mexico and to other countries.  They’re not leaving anymore, believe me.  There’s retribution if they leave.  There was no retribution. BARTIROMO:  Right. TRUMP:  They’d leave, they would sell their cars in, they’d fire all our people. Now, there’s retribution.  And they understand that.  Now, at the same time, I’m going to treat them great.  But we want them to expand their plants and build new plants and that’s what they’re doing. TRUMP:  Yes, I am waiting right now for so many people. BARTIROMO:  You’re under staffed. TRUMP:  Hundreds and hundreds of people.  And then they’ll say, why isn’t Trump doing this faster? You can’t do it faster, because they’re obstructing.  They’re obstructionists. So I have people  —   hundreds of people that we’re trying to get through.  I mean you have  —   you see the backlog.  We can’t get them through. BARTIROMO:  Yes. TRUMP:  And then the newspapers will say Trump doesn’t get them through.  Well, not  —   nothing to do with me.  Statutorily, you have to go through this process. So it’s been a lousy process.  It’s taken a long time to get my cabinet done.  And as you know, it’s not even done now. This is records stuff.  You know, we’re talking about records in terms of time.  And it’s very sad. Well, you see, even again, with the Supreme Court judge that everybody agrees is outstanding and you see what that process was. BARTIROMO:  Absolutely.  And the American people know it, I think. TRUMP:  I think they know it.  I think they get it.  I wish it would be explained better, the obstructionist nature, though, because a lot of times I’ll say why doesn’t so and so have people under him or her? The reason is because we can’t get them approved. BARTIROMO:  Well, people are still wondering, though, they’re scratching their heads, right, so many   staffers are still here. For example, was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the FBI at the outset of your presidency? Is it too late now to ask him to step down? TRUMP:  No, it’s not too late, but, you know, I have confidence in him.  We’ll see what happens.  You know, it’s going to be interesting. But, you know, we have to just  —   look, I have so many people that want to come into this administration.  They’re so excited about this administration and what’s happening  —   bankers, law enforcement  —   everybody wants to come into this administration.  Don’t forget, when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton.  People don’t realize that.  He saved her life, because  —   I call it Comey won.  And I joke about it a little bit. When he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge.  And then he said, she was essentially OK.  But he  —   she wasn’t OK, because she was guilty on every charge. And then you had two and then you had three. But Hillary Clinton won  —   or Comey won.  She was guilty on every charge. BARTIROMO:  Yes. TRUMP:  So Director Comey. .. BARTIROMO:  Well, that’s (INAUDIBLE). .. TRUMP:  No, I’m just saying. .. BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE)? TRUMP:  Well, because I want to give everybody a good, fair chance.  Director Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you.  If he weren’t, she would be, right now, going to trial. BARTIROMO:  Are you going to push that? Are you going to put. .. TRUMP:  No, I don’t want to talk about that, I want to talk about (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, just a final question for you. In the last weeks of the Obama presidency, he changed all the rules in terms of the intelligence agencies, allowing them to share raw data. TRUMP:  Terrible. BARTIROMO:  Why do you think he did this? TRUMP:  Well, I’m going to let you figure that one out.  But it’s so obvious.  When you look at Susan Rice and what’s going on, and so many people are coming up to me and apologizing now.  They’re saying you know, you were right when you said that. Perhaps I didn’t know how right I was, because nobody knew the extent of it.  (INAUDIBLE). .. BARTIROMO:  When you sent that. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   —   what they did. .. BARTIROMO:   —   was that what you were referring to, the Susan Rice? TRUMP:  Oh, sure.  We’re talking about surveillance.  It was wiretapped in quotes.  ”The New York Times” said the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition.  Then they took it out of there fast when they realized. But I put wiretapped in quotes, meaning, because, look, wiretapping is an  . .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   —   there are too many wires anymore, right? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:  You don’t have a lot of wires.  Look at this room.  This room used to have a lot of wires.  Now it doesn’t have so many wires. But we talked about surveillance or whatever.  And you look at the extent of the surveillance.  Me and so many other people, it’s terrible. BARTIROMO:  She said she didn’t do it for political reasons.  Susan Rice. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   —   does anybody really believe that? Nobody believes that, even the people that try to protect her in the news media.  It’s such a big story and I’m sure it will continue forward. But what they did is horrible. TRUMP:  Well, I think many.  We are going to have we are going to have tax reform at some point very soon.  I think we’re doing very well on health care.  It’s been very much misreported that we failed with health care.  We haven’t failed, we’re negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps $900 billion. You know, if you look at the kind of numbers that we’re talking about, that’s all going back into the taxes.  And we have to do health care first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So we’re going to have a phenomenal tax reform.  But I have to do health care first.  I want to do it first to really do it right. Health care has been going along  —   you know, it’s in negotiations (INAUDIBLE) and it’s just a negotiation.  And it’s going to take a little while longer, but as you’re probably hearing, Congress is coming along.  We have some great people in Congress.  They want it to happen. We will have no Democrats.  Zero.  That means we have to get close to 100 percent of the Republicans, not an easy way to run a government. You saw that with Justice Gorsuch, which is  —   who we’re very proud of.  He had no  —   almost no Democratic support, even though he was central casting, like the perfect Supreme Court judge. So we’ll see what happens.  I think we’re doing very well with health care, which surprises  —   that’s like breaking news, but they all know it, they just don’t tend to write it. And after that, we’re going to start on tax reform and infrastructure. BARTIROMO:  But do you have to do health care before tax reform. .. TRUMP:  Yes. BARTIROMO:  When I speak with business managers, they say tax reform is so much more impactful to moving the needle on economic growth. .. TRUMP:   And they’re right.  They’re all right.  But because I’m saving a tremendous amount  —   hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we’re saving on health care.  So we’re going to have a much better plan than ObamaCare, which is failing. Even now, as I came in here, they’re saying payments have to be made that weren’t scheduled to be made on ObamaCare.  If you don’t make them, it fails. I mean, you know, it’s just a mess.  ObamaCare is a total mess.  So we’re serving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one. And most importantly, actually, we’re going to have great health care.  And all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don’t do that, you can’t put any of the savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform. BARTIROMO:  How do you know you’re not going to have a similar battle on the tax. .. TRUMP:  Oh, I will. BARTIROMO:   —   (INAUDIBLE) to be, because you’ve got a border adjustment tax. .. TRUMP:  I will. BARTIROMO:   —   the deductions, so. .. TRUMP:  That’s right. BARTIROMO:   —   who’s to say that tax reform doesn’t fail the way the bill  —   the House bill did? TRUMP:  I think tax reform will be easier, but it’s going to be tough.  You have a lot of people out there that want  —   you know, they have their own agendas, including a lot of supporters of different people that are in Congress.  They have their own agendas.  They want certain things. Tax reform is going to be tough, but it won’t be as tough as health care.  Health care is very, very difficult. You look at that, look at Hillary Clinton failed and you look at so many of the others.  And ObamaCare failed.  ObamaCare was just, you know, they just, in the end, just gave up just to get the vote. You look at what they had to do in Nebraska, where they essentially gave it away to Nebraska to get that final vote. BARTIROMO:  And we know the premiums up 116 percent (INAUDIBLE). .. TRUMP:  The premiums, oh, the premiums. .. BARTIROMO:   —   in Arizona and across the country. TRUMP:  Are many, many of the  —   and this is going to be a much worse year than last year for ObamaCare.  So ObamaCare is a disaster.  It’s really gone.  Essentially, it’s gone. If ObamaCare isn’t bailed out almost on a monthly basis, it fails.  It immediately fails. We have a great health care plan that I think will happen and if it happens, then I go immediately to tax reform.  And that will happen.  That will be easier than health care. BARTIROMO:  How are you on the border adjustment tax? Have you decided? TRUMP:  I haven’t really wanted to talk about it.  I have my own feelings.  I don’t like the word adjustment, because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world. So when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose.  We lose. So I don’t like the term border adjustment. BARTIROMO:  Any tax at the border? TRUMP:  Weak.  Let’s call it an import tax.  Let’s call it a reciprocal tax.  You know, we have. .. BARTIROMO:  So it’s in there.  You want a. .. TRUMP:  We have countries, Maria, that charge us  —   our companies  —   100 percent tax if they sell a motorcycle or if they sell  —   they make it in America, they make it in the United States, they sell it various countries.  They sell very low, because the tax is 100 percent in some countries. The tax is 50 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent.  But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax. And do you think that’s fair? And do you think that’s smart? So I love the idea of reciprocal.  You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax.  There are numerous terms. BARTIROMO:  Yes. TRUMP:  But the reciprocal tax is very important. And you know the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax.  When you say we’re going to charge a border tax  —   we’d be a rich nation if we did it, by the way. .. BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP:   —   but, you know. .. BARTIROMO:  It sounds easier (INAUDIBLE). .. TRUMP:   —   but that  —   nobody cares about that.  But when you say reciprocal, nobody fights you.  When you say I’m going to charge a 10 percent or a 20 percent border tax, everyone goes crazy, because they like free trade.  Well, they don’t say that the other countries are charging you much more than that. But when you say a reciprocal tax  —   and I’m not saying that’s what I’m doing, but there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it.  But when you say reciprocal tax, nobody can get angry.  Even the other countries, if like  —   if they’re charging you a 50 percent tax, you say, OK, whatever you charge, we’re charging. BARTIROMO:  Like China and [India]. TRUMP:  They may not like it, but they can’t get angry because they can’t win that battle. BARTIROMO:  What if you have a debate, you can’t get to an agreement on that, do you prefer just cutting taxes? If you had to one, can you do just. .. TRUMP:  Yes, well, we. .. BARTIROMO:   —   corporate tax cuts? TRUMP:   —   could keep trade and we could keep certain things separate.  We may put it in the tax code or we may keep it separate.  We have a lot of different things. And don’t forget, we’re going to be bringing back, as part of this, I think the number is closer  —   closer to $5 trillion.  You know, you’ve been hearing  —   you’ve been using  —   and you keep using it, $2. 5 trillion, right? BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP:  But the money  —   the corporate inversions and the money over there is $2. 5 trillion.  So I think that money  —   because we’ve been saying that number for, what, five years now, would you say? So I know it’s much more.  It’s probably $5 trillion or $4 trillion.  That money is coming back.  We’re going to charge a very small tax on that money and the companies are going to bring that money back into the United States and do lots of good things with it. Right now, they can’t bring it back.  And it’s not only the high techs, it’s also because the bureaucracy is so horrible. I have friends who want to bring money back.  Even if they were willing to pay the tax, which very few people are willing, the bureaucracy, the paperwork, the work to get it in, it’s not worth it. BARTIROMO:  Which is why you’re rolling back these (INAUDIBLE). .. TRUMP:  Oh, I’m. .. (CROSSTALK) BARTIROMO:   —   through your executive orders.  You’re rolling back regulations. TRUMP:  I have gotten. .. BARTIROMO:  So if you had to do one. .. TRUMP:   —   rid of regulations. .. BARTIROMO:   —   corporate tax or individual tax, what’s more important, if you had to do one this year? TRUMP:  Both.  Both. BARTIROMO:  Both? TRUMP:  Both.  I almost think individual from my standpoint, because, you know, the middle class has just been taken advantage of in this country for so many years. But in terms of jobs, I mean I think both, but I think probably corporate.  But they kind of both go hand in hand.  It’s not going to matter. BARTIROMO:  Have you moved off of this soft deadline that your team put in place of August to get this done? Are you looking at the  —   later in the year? TRUMP:  Well, you know, I put a deadline on health care and the fake news immediately went crazy, because when I didn’t make the deadline, although I was. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:   —   negotiating  —   don’t forget, I said  —   and it’s true, I didn’t even say take a vote.  I say withdraw. Well, that same thing is being negotiated and great points are being won and lost, but great points are being won that are going to lower premiums and make our health care incredible. But by putting a deadline, they say, oh, Trump didn’t make it, he didn’t make it. Now, look, so I don’t want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen at some point. Now, if it doesn’t happen fast enough, I’ll start the taxes.  But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first. BARTIROMO:  What about infrastructure? How do you see it, when do you see it? TRUMP:  A hundred percent.  Very soon.  I see it as part, perhaps, of the health care plan, because phase two of the health care plan, in order to get the votes, I need 60 percent for that and if I put that in, the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan. So we’re going to actually  —   I believe, despite their tremendous hostility for years  —   this isn’t just for Trump.  This is for years it’s been so hostile. You know, Maria, when I used to come to Washington, because I’ve been a very political person all my life, even though not on this side of the equation.  But I’ve been very, very political. I used to see Democrats and Republicans.  They were best friends.  And they’d fight a little bit during the day and then they’d have dinner with their families at night.  You’d see them at restaurants. I used to joke with the business and, you know, Republicans. .. BARTIROMO:  They would have a coffee together? TRUMP:  Yes, they’d be together.  They’d have breakfast together.  And then they go and fight and then they have lunch. Today, you don’t see that.  The level of hatred is incredible.  And I’m not just saying in the last 90 days, I’m saying this has been for the last few years.  It’s incredibly divisive. BARTIROMO:  Has it gotten in the way of getting things done? TRUMP:  Well, as an example, on health care, I won’t get one Democrat vote, even though many of them think it’s an incredible plan. Take a look at Justice Gorsuch.  You can’t get better.  Top of the line in every aspect.  And he got three votes from the Democrats.  He should have gotten all of them.  He got three votes.  And those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it. But it’s  —   there’s a great level of hostility and they’re putting their hatred way, way above  —   way above the country and the benefit to the country that, you know, things that they do can have such benefit. So I probably  —   I always assume no Democrat votes.  Now, the good thing is we have the House.  We have the Senate.  And we have the White House.  So we’re all set. But within there, you have certain factions.  You have the conservative Republicans.  You have the moderate Republicans and you have to get them together. But we need close to 100 percent.  That’s a pretty hard thing to get.  But we get it. TRUMP:  OK, just so you understand, we’re not going into Syria, because, you know, there were some questions.  Nikki Haley is doing a great job.  Rex is doing a fantastic job, our secretary of State.  General McMaster, fantastic. But if you add it all up and if they take every little word, they’ll say oh, they’re different. Just so you understand, we’re not going into Syria.  But when I see people using horrible, horrible chemical weapons, which they agreed not to use under the Obama administration, but they violated it. BARTIROMO:  They said they got rid of them. TRUMP:  Look, what I did should have been done by the Obama administration a long time before I did it and you would have had a much better  —   I think Syria would be a lot better off right now than it has been. BARTIROMO:  Obama pushed. .. TRUMP:  (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO:   —   he resisted doing it. TRUMP:  When I looked, he  —   well, he didn’t do it. BARTIROMO:  Right. TRUMP:  I don’t know what happened, but he didn’t do it.  And in fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line in the sand.  They had a very big attack and everybody waited, what’s going on, and nothing happened. And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it. I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures on any show or any newspaper, but especially when you see them on television. .. BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP:   —   and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father’s arms, or you see kids gasping for life and you know they’re  —   it’s over.  It’s over for them.  They’re hosing them down, hundreds of them.  When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis. I said, what can we do? And they came back with a number of different alternatives.  And we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No.  But if I see them using gas and using things that  —   I mean even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn’t use the kind of gases that they used.  And some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So when I saw that, I said we have to do something. BARTIROMO:  Does the strike against Syria give more leverage to Rex Tillerson ahead of his meeting with his counterpart in Russia? TRUMP:  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  I can’t tell you.  But I’ll let you know soon, because they’re going to be finishing that meeting pretty soon.  Rex is doing an outstanding job.  He’s been  —   he’s got a great sense. Look, he ran ExxonMobil for many years and it was flawlessly run.  And he’s doing a really, really good job.  We’re proud of him. But he’s over in Russia.  He’s going soon.  He’s going to have meetings and then he’s coming back and I’ll certainly let us know. BARTIROMO:  What’s the message that you want him to deliver. .. TRUMP:  Well, I think the message is. .. BARTIROMO:   —   to the Russians? TRUMP:   —   number one, you should have peace in Syria.  It’s enough.  And frankly, you know, we talked the chemicals, because, you know, people just don’t see this, the level of brutality, the level of viciousness.  But when they drop barrel bombs and bombs of any kind right on top of a civilian population, that’s the worst thing  —   I’ve never seen anything like it. And frankly, Putin is backing a person that’s truly an evil person.  And I think it’s very bad for Russia.  I think it’s very bad for mankind.  It’s very bad for this world. But when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs  —   they have these massive barrels with dynamite and they drop them right in the middle of a group of people.  And in all fairness, you see the same kids  —   no arms, no legs, no face. This is an animal.  And I really think that there’s going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that peace happens, because, frankly, if Russia didn’t go in and back this animal, you wouldn’t have a problem right now.  He was going to be overthrown.  I thought he was gone.  He had another week.  I mean he was finished.  He had nothing, nothing. And then Russia came in and saved him.  And then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal.  So you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad. BARTIROMO:   You redirected navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What we are doing right now in terms of North Korea? TRUMP:  You never know, do you? You never know. BARTIROMO:  That’s all (INAUDIBLE). .. TRUMP:  You know I don’t think about the military. BARTIROMO:  Yes. TRUMP:  I’m not like Obama, where they talk about in four months we’re waiting  —   we’re going to hit Mosul. BARTIROMO:  Right. TRUMP:  And in the meantime, they get ready and like you’ve never seen  —   look, they’re still fighting.  Mosul was supposed to last for a week and now they’ve been fighting it for many months and so many more people died. I don’t want to talk about it.  We are sending an armada, very powerful.  We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you. And we have the best military people on Earth.  And I will say this.  He is doing the wrong thing.  He is doing the wrong thing. BARTIROMO:  Do you. .. TRUMP:  He’s making a big mistake. BARTIROMO:   —   do you think he’s mentally fit? TRUMP:  I don’t know.  I don’t know.  I don’t know him.  But he’s doing the wrong thing.  I have a very, very good meeting with President Xi of China.  I really liked him.  We had a great chemistry, I think.  I mean at least I had a great chemistry  —   maybe he didn’t like me, but I think he liked me. We were going to have a 10 or a 15 minute  .  It lasted for three hours.  Then the next day, it was another schedule, because everything is very orderly with the Chinese, frankly. And we had meetings scheduled.  Well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours.  The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours, just    the two of us with interpreters. And I mean we understand each other.  I think he’s, you know, a person that I got along with really well.  We had a good chemistry, yes. BARTIROMO:  Did he give you any suggestion that he would help. .. TRUMP:  Well. .. BARTIROMO:   —   with North Korea? TRUMP:  We had the meeting. BARTIROMO:  Did you get into trade and currency? TRUMP:  The first thing I brought up was North Korea.  I said you’ve got to help us with North Korea, because we can’t allow it.  And it’s not good for you.  And you have a tremendous power because of trade. Now, he then explains thousands of years of history with Korea.  Not that easy.  In other words, not as simple as people would think. They’ve had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years.  Now, his father was in China four times.  He was never in China. So I said, look, you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border.  If they don’t get food, they don’t get, you know, they can’t sell their coal.  In fact, I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea were sent back to North Korea, heading to China.  They were sent back, which is a very good sign. But I think China can help us.  I hope China can help us.  We talked about trade and I can tell you, China will do much better on trade if they help us with North Korea. BARTIROMO:  And you think he knows that? TRUMP:  I think he knows that.  I told him that, yes. BARTIROMO:  When you were with the president of China, you’re launching these military strikes. TRUMP:  Yes. BARTIROMO:  Was that planned? How did that come about that it’s happening right then, because right there, you’re saying a reminder, here’s who the superpower in the world is, right? TRUMP:  You have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this.  I have had  —   I have watched speculation for three days now on what that was like (INAUDIBLE). BARTIROMO:  When did you tell him? TRUMP:  But I’ll tell you (INAUDIBLE). .. BARTIROMO:  Before dessert or what? TRUMP:  But I will tell you, only because you’ve treated me so good for so long, I have to (INAUDIBLE) right? I was sitting at the table.  We had finished dinner.  We’re now having dessert.  And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen and President Xi was enjoying it. And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do? And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way.  And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you.  This was during dessert. We’ve just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing. BARTIROMO:  Unmanned? Brilliant. TRUMP:  It’s so incredible.  It’s brilliant.  It’s genius.  Our technology, our equipment, is better than anybody by a factor of five.  I mean look, we have, in terms of technology, nobody can even come close to competing. Now we’re going to start getting it, because, you know, the military has been cut back and depleted so badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq, which was another disaster. So what happens is I said we’ve just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq and I wanted you to know this. And he was eating his cake. And he was silent. BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) to Syria? TRUMP:  Yes. Heading toward Syria. In other words, we’ve just launched 59 missiles heading toward Syria.  And I want you to know that, because I didn’t want him to go home.  We were almost finished.  It was a full day in Palm Beach.  We’re almost finished and I  —   what does he do, finish his dessert and go home and then they say, you know, the guy you just had dinner with just attacked a country? BARTIROMO:  How did he react? TRUMP:  So he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again.  I didn’t think that was a good sign. And he said to me, anybody that uses gases  —   you could almost say or anything else  —   but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that young children and babies, it’s OK. BARTIROMO:  He agreed. TRUMP:  He was OK with it.  He was OK. I’ll tell you, we get along really well.  I really like being with him.  I’m going to be speaking to him tonight at 10:00, actually.  I have a call tonight at 10:00.  It’s all set up with the president of China. But we got along  —   there was a great feeling, I think, between both of us. Now, we have two very different countries, two very different peoples.  But I think he understood the message and I understood what he was saying to me.   "
"     The 2017 NFL draft is underway. Consider this your cheat sheet for the 2017 NFL draft, which features a   No. 1 prospect, massive uncertainty at quarterback and  —   as it does every year  —   the promise of many uncomfortable Roger Goodell bro hugs. Stick right here for live    analysis and get up to speed with all the latest   news below. The 2017 NFL Draft on The Washington Post Live draft analysis | Latest news and rumors | Mock drafts ON THE CLOCK    20. Denver Broncos Team needs: OT, TE, RB, Slot WR   LATEST PICK    19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers Team needs: OT, DE, DT The pick: O. J. Howard | TE | Alabama This is a great, great value for the Bucs at No. 19. Some projections had O. J. Howard going in the top five. He is clearly the draft’s top tight end, and he instantly should become a security blanket of a receiver for quarterback Jameis Winston. The Buccaneers pass up Dalvin Cook. But there are running backs to be had later in this draft.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: After completely dominating the Senior Bowl, Howard’s draft stock went up a notch. After his performance at the combine, his draft stock went up another two notches. He ran a 4. 51 in the 40 at 251 pounds. He completed 22 bench reps, ran a 6. 85   drill, a 4. 16 short shuttle and a 11. 46   shuttle. Those loud groans you hear are from Alabama fans wondering why former offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin didn’t throw him the ball more often. He’s a terrific prospect as a   tight end.  —   John Harris    Draft history  ROUND 1 PICKS    1. Cleveland Browns Team needs:   WR, QB The pick: Myles Garrett | DE | Texas A&M That’s the right pick by the Browns. Yes, they have a quarterback problem. But no QB was worth the No. 1 pick. Not Mitchell Trubisky. Not Deshaun Watson. Not Patrick Mahomes. Not anyone in this draft. Garrett is a potentially dominant pass rusher. That is a premium player worthy of the top pick. Now the Browns can focus on trying to trade up from No. 12  —   maybe to No. 5 in a deal with the Titans  —   to get Trubisky.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The former Aggie star put on a show at the combine in Indianapolis. He ran a 4. 64 in the   dash, put up 33 bench press reps of 225 pounds, posted a   vertical jump and a     broad jump. Let me remind you; he completed those tests at 272 pounds. Are you kidding? There are few guarantees in this process, but Garrett is one. He locked up the first spot after his stellar weekend in Indy.  —   John Harris    Draft history    [Draft craziness starts after No. 1 pick]      2. Chicago Bears (from 49ers) Team needs: DE, WR, CB The pick: Mitchell Trubisky | QB | North Carolina Wow. The draft has its first stunner on the second overall pick. The Bears traded up one spot and gave up quite a bit to do so. After signing Mike Glennon in free agency, the Bears take a QB with only 13 collegiate starts on his resume. They pass up defensive standouts Solomon Thomas, Jamal Adams, Marshon Lattimore and Jonathan Allen. This leaves the Bears open to some major  .  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Trubisky spun it well during his throwing session at the combine, but he certainly did not take over the top quarterback position. He threw again at his pro day in   and most felt the same way about it  —   solid, but not the best they’ve ever seen. Watching from afar, I saw something in his release that was a little funky that didn’t show up watching games.  —   John Harris    Draft history     3. San Francisco 49ers (from Bears) Team needs: S, QB, WR The pick: Solomon Thomas| DE | Stanford The Niners benefit greatly from the Bears’ curious   for Mitchell Trubisky. The 49ers get the player, in Solomon Thomas, who would have made perfect sense for them if they’d stayed put at No. 2. And they benefit from what the Bears surrendered to move up only one spot. Novice GM John Lynch did very well with his   draft choice.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Thomas isn’t the highest riser on this version of the top 50, but he’s one of the hottest prospects in this draft class at this moment. At the combine, the     defensive terror ran a 4. 69 in the 40, put up 30 reps, posted a    broad jump, a   vertical jump, a 6. 95   drill and a 4. 28 short shuttle. He’s a freak in the mold of one of his heroes  —   Ndamukong Suh. He continues to climb up draft boards and after a college career in the Bay Area, he may rise all the way to San Francisco at No. 2 on draft night.  —   John Harris    Draft history     4. Jacksonville Jaguars Team needs: TE, QB, RB The pick: Leonard Fournette | RB | LSU That’s a very sensible move by Jacksonville. Leonard Fournette gives them a workhorse runner who can become the centerpiece of the offense and take pressure off quarterback Blake Bortles. If ever there was a QB who needs pressure taken off him, it’s Bortles. It wasn’t so long ago that using such a lofty draft pick on a running back would have been taboo. But it worked out pretty well for the Cowboys with Ezekiel Elliott, didn’t it?  —   Mark Maske What he brings: When it was announced Fournette weighed in at 240 pounds at the combine, there was a buzz throughout the media area. He stated later that day it was water weight. Regardless, he was too heavy. He shouldn’t play one day of his NFL career over 230. Yet, he ran a 4. 51 in the   dash at 240. Being overweight on his testing day will create some concerns and questions for the former Tiger star, but he seemed unconcerned with any issues teams may have with him. And he went No. 4, so   …      —   John Harris    Draft history     5. Tennessee Titans (from Rams) The pick: Corey Davis | WR | Western Michigan The Titans have the fifth and 18th picks and must come away with a wide receiver and a cornerback. They get the wideout first. But it’s questionable whether Davis is the best receiver in this draft (over Clemson’s Mike Williams) and it’s very questionable whether he’s worth the No. 5 overall choice. It’s surprising the Titans were unable to trade down. And it’s extremely surprising they didn’t go with Marshon Lattimore, a cornerback who would have been well worth the No. 5 selection, and then come back later in this opening round to get their wide receiver.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Davis suffered an ankle injury that required surgery earlier this offseason and that kept him from completing any testing for NFL teams. On the field, he’s a legit 4. 4 guy and that’s more than good enough for a guy of his football skill.  —   John Harris    Draft history     6. New York Jets Team needs: WR, TE, CB, OT The pick: Jamal Adams | S | LSU Jamal Adams just misses being the first safety to be chosen in the top five of the NFL draft since Eric Berry by the Chiefs in 2010. The Jets leave Deshaun Watson on the board, passing up the chance to address their QB situation. They also go with Adams over cornerback Marshon Lattimore. But Adams is worth the No. 6 pick.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The     Adams ran well at the combine, posting a 4. 56 in the 40, a      drill and a 4.  short shuttle. Times such as these prove he has the ability to interchange and play either safety spot in any situation or scheme.  —   John Harris    Draft history     7. Los Angeles Chargers Team needs: OG, S, WR The pick: Mike Williams | WR | Clemson Mike Williams was supposed to be the first wide receiver taken in this draft. Instead, he is the second, after the surprisingly early selection of Corey Davis by the Titans. He is a legitimate   choice and he’ll be a big asset for quarterback Philip Rivers and the Chargers’ offense.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Williams didn’t impress many at the combine and chose not to run the 40. It shouldn’t really come as a shock, though, that he wasn’t a combine warrior. He’s a   threat with terrific size and improved hands. He dominated defensive backs with his technique, size and hands, not speed. When he ran in the 4. 5 range at Clemson’s pro day, it alleviated any concern.  —   John Harris    Draft history     8. Carolina Panthers Team needs: RB, DE, CB The pick: Christian McCaffrey | RB | Stanford This might be a little bit early for Christian McCaffrey. But Leonard Fournette was off the board and the Panthers certainly needed a running back with Jonathan Stewart now on the wrong side of age 30. McCaffrey’s versatility brings a new dimension to the Carolina offense.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: There was a buzz at the combine whenever McCaffrey entered a room or participated in an event. He posted a 37.  vertical jump, along with      drill times, including a time of 6. 57 seconds in the   drill. During his position drills, McCaffrey caught the ball as naturally as any receiver on site and ran routes as if he were a true slot receiver. At his pro day at Stanford, he did the same, running a litany of routes out of the backfield masterfully.  —   John Harris    Draft history     9. Cincinnati Bengals Team needs: LB, OT, OG The pick: John Ross | WR | Washington John Ross is a speedster. And he’s more than that. He’s a good overall receiver. But was he worth the No. 9 pick in this draft? That’s debatable. And the Bengals passing up Jonathan Allen, Reuben Foster, Marshon Lattimore and Malik Hooker is highly questionable.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He ran a 4. 22 in the 40, breaking the recent best mark at the combine of Chris Johnson in 2008. Ross even tweaked his leg at the   mark and still broke Johnson’s record. Although he didn’t do any further tests, he made a significant impression. If there’s a concern about Ross, it’s that he can easily be disrupted by physical corners and that could push Ross inside permanently as a slot receiving option. Now, they still have to catch the speedy Ross, who reminds me a great deal of former Washington Redskins receiver DeSean Jackson.  —   John Harris    Draft history     10. Kansas City (from Bills) Team needs: CB, ILB, QB The pick: Patrick Mahomes II | QB | Texas Tech The Chiefs move up 17 spots, giving up next year’s   in the process, to get their QB of the future. They go with Patrick Mahomes instead of Deshaun Watson. Mahomes presumably will spend the upcoming season as Alex Smith’s understudy, watching and learning and waiting for his turn. So much for NFL teams being ambivalent about the QBs in this draft class. That’s two off the board in the top 10, and Deshaun Watson presumably will be taken very soon.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Similar to Deshaun Watson, Mahomes threw the ball well at the combine but he didn’t overwhelmingly separate himself from all of the quarterback candidates. He’s got potential and he’ll have time to develop in Kansas City.  —   John Harris    Draft history     11. New Orleans Saints Team needs: Slot   DE, CB The pick: Marshon Lattimore | CB | Ohio State The Saints get lucky and the draft’s top cornerback, Marshon Lattimore, falls to them at No. 11. The run on offensive players in the top 10 works to the benefit of New Orleans, which is perpetually in need of help on defense and gets it in a big way. The Saints opted against signing Malcolm Butler to an offer sheet in restricted free agency or (at least so far) trading for him. Instead, they bolster their cornerback corps with this pick.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: There’s been so much buzz around the cornerbacks in this draft class and Lattimore is at the top of the list. He ran a blazing 4. 36 in the 40 at the combine and that seemed to lock him in the top cornerback spot on the draft’s first night.  —   John Harris    Draft history     12. Houston Texans (from Browns, from Eagles) Team needs: QB, OT, CB The pick: Deshaun Watson | QB | Clemson This is fascinating. The Texans, after the failed signing of Brock Osweiler last offseason and Tony Romo’s retirement this offseason before Houston could land him, make a bold trade up to get Deshaun Watson. Good for the Texans. Having Tom Savage and Brandon Weeden as their QB options was not good enough for a team that is, in other ways, Super  . The Browns, after trading the pick last year that the Eagles used for Carson Wentz, now trade the pick that the Texans use for Watson. The Browns needed to come away from this draft with Mitchell Trubisky or Patrick Mahomes or Watson (or Jimmy Garoppolo or Kirk Cousins or AJ McCarron). So far, they haven’t. They continue to amass draft picks. But at some point, you actually have to turn one of them into a franchise QB.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Studying Watson the past three seasons, there are questionable throws on tape, some definite “What the   …     ? !?” decisions. What makes him the top quarterback candidate on this board, though, are impressive throws into tight windows and clutch throws late in games. The obvious example was the clutch performance in the fourth quarter against Alabama for the national championship. He didn’t overwhelm scouts and teams with his throwing sessions at the combine or at Clemson’s pro day.  —   John Harris    Draft history     13. Arizona Cardinals Team needs: QB, S, Slot   The pick: Haason Reddick |   | Temple The early run on offensive players has left plenty of very good defensive players available. The Cardinals get one of them in Haason Reddick. Jonathan Allen, Reuben Foster and Malik Hooker remain available.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: I missed Reddick’s ranking more than any other on my initial Top 50. I knew when I submitted it early in February I had ranked him way too low. His combine performance only solidified that feeling. At 237 pounds, he ran a 4. 52 40, posted a 36.  vertical jump and a    broad jump, along with 24 bench press reps. His Senior Bowl performance showed what’s he capable of, but at the combine, he flashed the athleticism that locked up a   spot.  —   John Harris    Draft history     14. Philadelphia Eagles (from Vikings) Team needs: CB, RB, WR The pick: Derek Barnett | DE | Tennessee It might not be an electrifying choice but Derek Barnett is a very productive pass rusher. He broke Reggie White’s sack record at Tennessee and now he joins White’s former team, the Eagles. He will be an asset to the Philadelphia defense.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Barnett isn’t nearly as “twitchy” as the other edge players in this draft class and that was evident in his testing at the combine. However, his hand work, strength and quickness rushing the passer led to moments of sheer dominance in the SEC.  —   John Harris    Draft history     15. Indianapolis Colts Team needs: DT, DE, ILB, CB, S The pick: Malik Hooker | S | Ohio State The teams needing defensive help are going to get some   picks during the remainder of this opening round, following the early moves for offensive players. The Colts benefit with Malik Hooker dropping to them at No. 15. He was thought to be   .  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Hooker has just begun to do some jogging and running after postseason surgery. That could create some anxiety and could be why he fell out of the top 10. He was that good, though, in his one year as a starter that drafting him is a calculated risk worth taking.  —   John Harris    Draft history     16. Baltimore Ravens Team needs: WR, OT, RB, CB The pick: Marlon Humphrey | CB | Alabama Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome loves Alabama players and he gets a good one in cornerback Marlon Humphrey. It addresses a need for the Ravens. Humphrey becomes the second cornerback taken in this draft after Marshon Lattimore. There could be several more cornerbacks taken in the bottom half of the opening round with Tre’Davious White, Adoree’ Jackson and perhaps Kevin King.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The major concern for Humphrey isn’t a physical one. He tested well at the combine, running a 4. 41 in the 40. His concern is trouble playing the ball in the air when he’s in position to make a play. He’s rarely out of position, but there are plays he’s left on the field during his career at Alabama.  —   John Harris    Draft history     17. Washington Redskins Team needs: DT, ILB, RB  The pick: Jonathan Allen | DE | Alabama This could be a great pick for the Redskins. They certainly needed the help on defense. Jonathan Allen was regarded by some analysts as one of the top two or three players available in this draft. Some teams seemed wary of his shoulder issues. But he can play and he fits in well with the Redskins’ defensive scheme. The Redskins might have been tempted if Christian McCaffrey had fallen to them. But he was long gone, and Allen makes perfect sense for them. Who needs a general manager to oversee a draft?  —   Mark Maske   [Jonathan Allen: From foster care to the first round]   What he brings: The combine medicals were not kind to Allen as they unearthed moderate shoulder arthritis. Was that what pushed him down the board? NFL teams worry immensely about everything, but preexisting medical conditions amp up the nerves more than just about anything.  —   John Harris    Draft history     18. Tennessee Titans Team needs: WR, CB, TE The pick: Adoree’ Jackson | CB | USC Everyone figured the Titans would walk away from this opening round with a wide receiver and a cornerback. Everyone figured right. The Titans got their wideout, Corey Davis, at No. 5. And they get their cornerback, Adoree’ Jackson, at No. 18. They’ve done reasonably well, even if you can question whether Davis was worth the fifth overall pick.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The former USC   star ran a 4. 42 in the 40, one of the top times at the cornerback position. Some expected a better time given his track background, but 4. 42 is solid. He registered a   vertical jump and a    broad jump, but that was all the testing he did in Indianapolis. Some teams are still leery of his unrefined technique, but his athleticism and current focus entirely on football will help him become a starter in the NFL early in his career.  —   John Harris    Draft history  *** The latest news, rumors and analysis The most likely picks to be traded A look at which teams should be wheeling and dealing on draft day.

Maske’s mock draft: It’s Myles Garrett and then it gets complicated Harris’s mock draft: The QBs are creating chaos in the first round 1. Cleveland Browns Maske: Myles Garrett,   Texas A&M Harris: Garrett The Browns are reportedly seriously considering going with a quarterback at this spot? Really? Garrett is the best prospect in this draft. The Browns desperately need help on the edge. Tell me why the Browns wouldn’t take Garrett at this spot. Oh, a quarterback? They also have the 12th pick in the draft   …     for now.  —   Harris 2. San Francisco 49ers  Maske: Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford Harris: Thomas The 49ers are flirting with quarterbacks and threatening to pick one as high as No. 2. GM John Lynch has also said he’s ready to wheel and deal. In other words, the threat to take a quarterback is to entice a team to take Lynch up on his offer. It won’t happen; the 49ers won’t get an offer to their liking and will select Thomas in their final minute on the clock.  —   Harris 3. Chicago Bears Maske: Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State Harris: Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama The Bears have also said they’re willing to trade away the No. 3 pick. No player, though, entices other teams to jump up to take their guy. Ohio State safety Malik Hooker is nearly 100 percent healthy, but the Bears added some help at safety in the offseason. They need even more help at the defensive end spot, which makes this pick relatively straightforward.  —   Harris 4. Jacksonville Jaguars  Maske: Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Harris: O. J. Howard, TE, Alabama The former Alabama tight end is a perfect fit in Jacksonville, providing the   seam threat for struggling quarterback Blake Bortles. Many contend this is the spot for Leonard Fournette, but the Jaguars have no players at tight end and two capable running backs. Howard can provide more assistance for Bortles than a   limited scheme runner such as Fournette.  —   Harris 5. Tennessee Titans (from Los Angeles Rams)  Maske: Trade to Browns, who take Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina Harris: Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State The Titans will consider moving the 18th pick in the draft, but with Hooker on the board, GM Jon Robinson stands pat to select the Ohio State safety. With assurances that he’s near full health, Robinson will eventually team Hooker with 2016 draft pick Kevin Byard. Robinson and the Titans turned last year’s No. 1 pick into   rookie tackle Jack Conklin, NT Austin Johnson, RB Derrick Henry, Hooker and the   pick to be decided in this draft. Wow.  —   Harris 6. New York Jets Maske: Deshaun Watson, QB, North Carolina Harris: Trade to Browns, who take Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina GM Mike Maccagnan should love dealing with the Browns and their bounty of draft picks. Maccagnan will take a bevy of picks, including No. 12 and potentially former Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler, to move down to 12. The Browns, in turn, draft the local boy before the Bills do at No. 10. Garrett and Trubisky should be cornerstone pieces for the foreseeable future and this is a Sonny Weaver Jr.  haul for the Browns on Thursday night.  —   Harris 7. Los Angeles Chargers  Maske: Jamal Adams, S, LSU Harris: Adams The Chargers will consider Davis at this spot to give Philip Rivers another weapon in the passing game, but GM Tom Telesco knows he has to bolster the safety position or the interior of his offensive line. This is a tad too high for any of the offensive linemen on the board, so Telesco will select Adams.  —   Harris 8. Carolina Panthers Maske: Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State Harris: Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford The Panthers must maintain a diversified offense that does not feature a bevy of designed Cam Newton runs. Newton has taken a pounding in previous seasons and it took a toll on the 2015 NFL MVP in 2016. McCaffrey allows the offense to remain multiple and diversified thanks to his multidimensional talents, more so than Fournette.  —   Harris 9. Cincinnati Bengals  Maske: Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama Harris: Foster The NFL Scouting Combine incidents (yes, plural) will turn away plenty of teams, but not the Bengals. Head coach Marvin Lewis and company have rarely written off those that seemingly can’t be saved. Foster can be, and he can   this Cincinnati defense. Kevin Minter was added to satisfy a need at linebacker, but Foster is an even better fit.  —   Harris 10. Buffalo Bills  Maske: Mike Williams, WR, Clemson Harris: Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan  The Bills will consider all the quarterbacks but with Mitchell Trubisky off the board, they’ll hone in on weapons to help their current starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor. Davis has been a bit of a mystery in this process as he rehabbed an injury, but he’s the most complete receiver in this draft.  —   Harris 11. New Orleans Saints  Maske: Marlon Humphre, CB, Alabama Harris: Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State The Saints have negotiated terms with Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, but it doesn’t appear as if a deal will get done. If it does, the Saints can focus on some linebacker help, potentially Temple combination linebacker Haason Reddick. But, with no deal imminent, the Saints will take Lattimore.  —   Harris 12. Cleveland Browns  Maske: Trade to Titans, who take Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan Harris: Trade to Jets, who take Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State Note: Harris made this selection before the sexual assault accusation against Conley. The Jets move down to No. 12, pick up a Browns   pick and select Lattimore’s teammate Conley. Current Jets cornerbacks Buster Skrine, Morris Claiborne and others surely will not intimidate Tom Brady and Ryan Tannehill any time soon. Conley will help in that regard.  —   Harris 13. Arizona Cardinals  Maske: Patrick Mahomes, QB, Texas Tech Harris: Mahomes Mahomes will sit behind Carson Palmer and learn from Bruce Arians, who once schooled Mahomes’s football doppelgänger Ben Roethlisberger. Of the quarterbacks in this, and the next, draft that Arians could mold into a star, Mahomes fits the bill as well as anyone.  —   Harris 14. Philadelphia Eagles (from Minnesota Vikings)  Maske: Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee Harris: Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Fournette will immediately become the hammer in this offense, taking on the Zeke Elliott role in Philadelphia. A   combination isn’t quite   but it’s a step in the right direction.  —   Harris 15. Indianapolis Colts  Maske: Jonathan Allen, DE, Alabama Harris: Malik McDowell, DT, Michigan State New GM Chris Ballard has made some shrewd moves in free agency, acquiring youth for discount prices. McDowell, though, will immediately become the best interior player in a Colts jersey, no matter where he aligns.  —   Harris 16. Baltimore Ravens  Maske: O. J. Howard, TE, Alabama Harris: John Ross, WR, Washington The Ravens don’t have a consistent   threat in the passing game. We’re all still waiting to see what Breshad Perriman can do and Mike Wallace is just a   in waiting. (Think Tim Brown going long.) Ross, if healthy, opens up a completely different dimension for the Ravens passing game in the near future.  —   Harris 17. Washington Redskins  Maske: Christian McCaffrey, RB, Stanford Harris: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State The addition of Zach Brown allows the Redskins to bypass linebacker in Round 1. In so doing, the Redskins can focus squarely on the third, and last,   running back prospect. Rob Kelley had a modicum of   moments last year, but Cook is on a different level. As long as he didn’t fail his medicals, this feels like the right spot for the former Seminole star.  —   Harris [Should the Redskins seek additional   help?] 18. Tennessee Titans Maske: Kevin King, CB, Washington Harris: Trade to Raiders, who take Haason Reddick, LB, Temple The Raiders need an inside linebacker yesterday. I was struck by how small and slow the Raiders’ inside linebackers were in 2016 and it’s clear an immediate upgrade is necessary. Reddick isn’t the biggest linebacker by any means, but he can stay on the field on all three downs, rushing from the outside, if necessary, opposite 2016 defensive player of the year Khalil Mack.  —   Harris 19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers  Maske: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State Harris: Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee DE Noah Spence showed some potential as a rookie in 2016 and William Gholston   with the Bucs after four seasons with the squad. Neither, however, can do what Barnett can. The former Volunteer has the potential to be a   player next to McCoy, setting the edge against the run, then rushing the edge opposite Spence.  —   Harris 20. Denver Broncos  Maske: Ryan Ramczyk, T, Wisconsin Harris: Garett Bolles, T, Utah The Broncos’ offensive line has been a source of concern in Denver for a while and Bolles is the best true tackle prospect on the board. He’s going to be a work in progress, given his inexperience playing the position. His athleticism, though, is too much for the Broncos to eschew at this spot.  —   Harris 21. Detroit Lions  Maske: Haason Reddick, LB, Temple Harris: Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan The Lions’ pass rush could use some help and the true   power end from Michigan is waiting. This might be a few picks higher than Charlton is projected to be selected, but he fits the Detroit defense with his size, length and ability to rush the passer.  —   Harris 22. Miami Dolphins  Maske: Forrest Lamp, G, Western Kentucky Harris: Lamp Once Branden Albert was traded to Jacksonville and Laremy Tunsil moved from guard to fill Albert’s left tackle position, it was clear that Lamp needed to be in their crosshairs. Keep an eye, though, on Alabama offensive tackle Cam Robinson here, too. The Dolphins had success transitioning Tunsil from tackle to guard. They could do the same with Robinson.  —   Harris 23. New York Giants  Maske: Cam Robinson, T, Alabama Harris: David Njoku, TE, Miami The Giants couldn’t have had a better situation truly fall right into their laps. The addition of Brandon Marshall, alongside Odell Beckham Jr. and Sterling Shepard, should allow Njoku the opportunity to consistently run unabated down the field. An athlete of this caliber should make life that much easier for quarterback Eli Manning. If a running back drops to No. 23, the Giants should make him the pick, but Njoku is an adequate consolation prize if that does not happen.  —   Harris 24. Oakland Raiders  Maske: Garrett Bolles, T, Utah Harris: Trade to Titans, who take Mike Williams, WR, Clemson The Titans traded down from No. 18 to this spot with an eye on a receiver or a cornerback. With Williams on the board, the decision was easy. The Titans can highlight a defensive back with one of their Day 2 selections (one their own, one from L. A. from last year’s trade and another from the earlier trade with the Raiders).  —   Harris 25. Houston Texans  Maske: Adoree’ Jackson, CB, USC Harris: Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson As an employee of the Texans, I’ve offered this selection up to my friends at The Post, as has become our custom. This one will make the fans of Houston ecstatic. Although I think the Texans will only go with a quarterback here if either Watson or Mahomes is on the board, selecting Watson will make for an extremely interesting training camp at The Greenbrier in West Virginia this summer.  —   Harris 26. Seattle Seahawks  Maske: Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan Harris: Ryan Ramczyk, T, Wisconsin Drafting one spot ahead of Seattle, the Texans need a right tackle badly, but need a quarterback, too. They could still surprise by selecting Ramczyk, but in the end, Watson is too good at that spot to pass up. That allows the Seahawks to draft Ramczyk. In doing so, they can leave last year’s   selection, Germain Ifedi, at guard, where he belongs, and allow Ramczyk to develop at tackle.  —   Harris 27. Kansas City Chiefs  Maske: Jarrad Davis, LB, Florida Harris: Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama The Chiefs don’t have a consistent answer at cornerback opposite Marcus Peters, so Humphrey makes a ton of sense in this spot. He’s physical and can run, but needs work on playing the ball in the air. The Chiefs will add some depth at linebacker, defensive line and running back in later rounds.  —   Harris 28. Dallas Cowboys  Maske: Tre’Davious White, CB, LSU Harris: Jabrill Peppers,   Michigan The Cowboys don’t have a reliable   but they also lost two starters at the safety position in free agency. Byron Jones will take over at one position, while Jeff Heath is slated to step into the other. Peppers is a much more palatable option, which allows Heath to stay in a nickel role. Peppers’s stock has taken a hit in the days leading up to the draft, however.  —   Harris 29. Green Bay Packers  Maske: T. J. Watt, LB, Wisconsin Harris: Kevin King, CB, Washington King’s name hasn’t been thrown around all that much for   consideration, but he’s    can fly and was highly productive at Washington opposite Sidney Jones, who would’ve been off the board if not for an Achilles injury he suffered on his pro day. The Packers’ cornerback situation is far from optimum and the athletically gifted King fills a need here for certain.  —   Harris 30. Pittsburgh Steelers  Maske: David Njoku, TE, Miami Harris: T. J. Watt,   Wisconsin The Steelers have worked out quarterbacks privately, including Mahomes, but he and two others are off the board. As such, teams at the top portion of the second round have no incentive to move up and trade with Pittsburgh. The Steelers need more production rushing the quarterback from Bud Dupree. The selection of one of the best pass rushers in this draft should get Dupree’s attention or get him benched. Watt could also move to inside linebacker next to Ryan Shazier, if it gets him on the field with Dupree.  —   Harris 31. Atlanta Falcons  Maske: Takk McKinley,   UCLA Harris: McKinley The Falcons are all about speed. Look at this defense. Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett,   star Vic Beasley, inside linebacker Deion Jones and the youngsters in the secondary can all fly. With Beasley and McKinley rushing from the edge on third down, the Falcons won’t allow NFC South quarterbacks Cam Newton, Drew Brees or Jameis Winston much time to process and throw down the field.  —   Harris 32. New Orleans Saints  Maske: John Ross, WR, Washington Harris: Charles Harris,   Missouri The Saints could use this pick in a deal to pluck Malcolm Butler from New England, but it doesn’t appear as if the Saints are ready to make that move. As such, the Saints seemingly always need   help and Harris is the most dynamic player on the board. If the Saints end Thursday night with Lattimore and Harris, they’ll be instantly better at two key positions.  —   Harris"
"          Former acting attorney general Sally Yates and James R. Clapper Jr. the former director of national intelligence, are testifying at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This is the transcript of the hearing.   [Sally Yates testifies about White House meeting]     SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM,  . C.:   …     Our two witnesses are well known and will be sworn in but Mr. Clapper, the former director of national intelligence has served his country for decades in uniform and out and dedicated his life to intelligence gathering and we appreciate that. Ms. Yates was the former deputy attorney general, is well respected by people in the legal profession. Thank you both for coming. If you’ll please rise. Raise your right hand, please. Do you affirm that testimony you’re about to give this subcommittee is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? SALLY Q. YATES, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERA: (OFF MIKE) GRAHAM: Mr. Clapper. JAMES R. CLAPPER JR. FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: (OFF MIKE). Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Whitehouse and members of the subcommittee, certainly didn’t expect to be before this committee or any other committee of the Congress again so soon since I thought I was all done with this when I left the government. And this is only my first of two hearings this week. But understandably, concern about the egregious Russian interference in our election process is so critically serious as to merit focus, hopefully bipartisan focus by the Congress and the American people. Last year, the intelligence community conducted an exhaustive review of Russian interference into our presidential election process resulting in a special intelligence community assessment or ICA as we call it. I’m here today to provide whatever information I can now as a private citizen on how the intelligence community conducted its analysis, came up with its findings, and communicated them to the Obama administration, to the Trump transition team, to the Congress and in unclassified form to the American public. Additionally, I’ll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures (ph) requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over. As you know, the I. C. was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term. The two dozen or so analysts for this task were   seasoned experts from each of the contributing agencies. They were given complete, unfettered mutual access to all sensitive raw intelligence data, and importantly, complete independence to reach their findings. They found that the Russian government pursued a multifaceted influence campaign in the   to the election, including aggressive use of cyber capabilities. The Russians used cyber operations against both political parties, including hacking into servers used by the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data to WikiLeaks and other media outlets. Russia also collected on certain Republican   affiliated targets, but did not release any   data. The Intelligence Community Assessment concluded first that President Putin directed and influenced campaign to erode the faith and confidence of the American people in our presidential election process. Second, that he did so to demean Secretary Clinton, and third, that he sought to advantage Mr. Trump. These conclusions were reached based on the richness of the information gathered and analyzed and were thoroughly vetted and then approved by the directors of the three agencies and me. These Russian activities and the result and (ph) assessment were briefed first to President Obama on the 5th of January, then to   Trump at Trump Tower on the 6th and to the Congress via a series of five briefings from the 6th through the 13th of January. The classified version was profusely annotated, with footnotes drawn from thousands of pages of supporting material. The key judgments in the unclassified version published on the 6th of January were identical to the classified version. While it’s been over four months since the issuance of this assessment, as Directors Comey and Rodgers testified before the House Intelligence Committee on the 20th of March, the conclusions and confidence levels reached at the time still stand. I think that’s a statement to the quality and professional of the  —   of the intelligence community people who produced such a compelling intelligence report during a tumultuous, controversial time, under intense scrutiny and with a very tight deadline. Throughout the public dialogue about the issue over the past few months, four related topics have been raised that could use some clarification. I’d like to take a few moments to provide  —   attempt to provide that clarification. First, I want to address the meaning of quote, “unmasking,” which is an unofficial term that’s appeared frequently in the media in recent months and was often I think misused and misunderstand. So it frequently happens that in the course of conducting lawfully authorized electronic surveillance on validated foreign intelligence targets, the collecting agency picks up communications involving U. S. persons, either their direct interface with a validated foreign intelligence target or where there is discussion about those U. S. persons by validated foreign intelligence targets. Under intelligence community minimization procedures, the identities of these U. S. persons are typically masked in reports that go out to intelligence consumers and they’re referred to each report at a time as U. S. person one, U. S. person two, et cetera. However, there are cases when, to fully understand the context of the communication that has been obtained or the threat that is posed, the consumer of that collected intelligence may ask the identity of the U. S. person be revealed. Such requests explain why the unmasking is necessary and that explanation is conveyed back to the agency that collected the information. It is then up to that agency whether to approve the request and to provide the identity. And if the U. S. person’s identity is revealed, that identity is provided only to the person who properly requested it, not to a broader audience. This process is subject to oversight and reporting, and in the interest of transparency, my former office publishes a report on the statistics of how many U. S. persons’ identities are unmasked based on collection that occurred under section 702 of the FISA Amendment Act, which I’ll speak to in a moment. And in 2016, that number was 1, 934. On several occasions during my six and a half years as DNI, I requested the identity of U. S. persons to be revealed. In each such instance, I made these requests so I could fully understand the context of the communication and the potential threat being posed. At no time did I ever submit a request for personal or political purposes or to voyeuristically look at raw intelligence nor am I aware of any instance of such abuse by anyone else. Second is the issue of leaks. Leaks have been conflated with unmaskings in some of the public discourse, but they are two very different things. An unmasking is a legitimate process that consists of a request and approval by proper authorities, as I’ve just briefly described. A leak is an unauthorized disclosure of classified or sensitive information that is improper under any circumstance. I’ve long maintained during my   year career in intelligence that leaks endanger national security, they compromise sources, methods and tradecraft and they can put assets’ lives at risk. And for the record, in my long career, I’ve never knowingly exposed classified information in an inappropriate manner. Third is the issue of counterintelligence investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. While I can’t and won’t comment in this setting on any particular counterintelligence investigation, it’s important to understand how such investigations fit into and relate to the intelligence community and at least the general practice I followed during my time as DNI with respect to FBI counterintelligence investigations. When the intelligence community obtains information suggesting that a U. S. person is acting on behalf of a foreign power, the standard procedure is to share that information with the lead investigatory body, which of course is the FBI. The bureau then decides whether to look into that information and handles any ensuing investigation if there is one. Given its sensitivity, even the existence of a counterintelligence investigation’s closely held, including at the highest levels. During my tenure as DNI, it was my practice to defer to the FBI director, both Director Mueller and then subsequently Director Comey, on whether, when and to what extent they would inform me about such investigations. This stems from the unique position of the FBI, which straddles both intelligence and law enforcement. And as a consequence, I was not aware of the counterintelligence investigation Director Comey first referred to during his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence on the 20th of March, and that comports with my public statements. Finally I’d like to comment on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendment Acts, as it’s called, what it governs and why it’s vital. This provision authorizes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to approve electronic surveillance of  . S. person, let me repeat that,  . S. person, foreign intelligence targets outside the United States. Section 702 has been a tremendously effective tool in identifying terrorists and other threats to us, while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U. S. persons. And as the  —   as Chairman Graham indicated, Section 702 is due for reauthorization by Congress this year. It was renewed in 2012 for five years and it expires on 31 December of this year. With so many misconceptions flying around, it would be tragic for Section 702 to become a casualty of misinformation and for us to lose a tool that is so vital to the safety of this nation. In conclusion, Russia’s influence activities in the   to the 2016 election constituted the high water mark of their long running efforts since the 1960s to disrupt and influence our elections. They must be congratulating themselves for having exceeded their wildest expectations with a minimal expenditure of resource. And I believe they are now emboldened to continue such activities in the future both here and around the world, and to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the very foundation of our democratic political system, this episode is it. I hope the American people recognize the severity of this threat and that we collectively counter it before it further erodes the fabric of our democracy. I’ll now turn to my former colleague, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, for any remarks that she has to make. YATES: Thank you. Chairman Graham, Ranking Member Whitehouse and distinguished members of the subcommittee, I’m pleased to appear before you this afternoon on this critically important topic of Russian interference in our last presidential election and the related topics that this subcommittee is investigating. For 27 years, I was honored to represent the people of the United States with the Department of Justice. I began as an assistant United States attorney in Atlanta in the fall of 1989, and like all prosecutors, I investigated and tried cases and worked hard to try to ensure the safety of our communities and that those who violated our laws were held accountable. Over time, through five Republican and Democratic administrations, I assumed greater leadership positions within the department. In the U. S. Attorney’s Office in Atlanta, I served as chief of the fraud and public corruption section as first assistant United States attorney and then was appointed United States attorney. And then, I had the privilege of serving as deputy attorney general for a little over two years, and finally, the current administration asked me to stay on as acting attorney general. Throughout my time at the department, I was incredibly fortunate to be able to work with the talented career men and women at the Department of Justice, who followed the facts and applied the law with tremendous care and dedication and who are, in fact, the backbone of the Department of Justice. And at every step, in every position, from AUSA to acting attorney general, I always try to carry out my responsibility to seek justice in a way that would engender the trust and the confidence of the people whom I served. I want to thank this subcommittee for conducting an impartial and thorough investigation of this vitally important topic. The efforts by a foreign adversary to interfere and undermine our Democratic processes and  —   and those of our allies pose a serious threat to all Americans. This hearing and others this subcommittee has conducted and will be conducting in the future are an important bipartisan step in understanding the threat and the best ways to confront it going forward. As the intelligence community assessed in its January of 2017 report, Russia will continue to develop capabilities to use against the United States and we need to be ready to meet those threats. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to take part in today’s discussion. Now, I want to note that in my answers today, I intend to be as fulsome and as comprehensive as possible, while respecting my legal and ethical boundaries. As the subcommittee understands, many of the topics of interest today concern classified information that I cannot address in this public setting. My duty to protect classified information applies just as much as a former official, as it did when I led the department. In addition, I’m obviously no longer with the Department of Justice and I am not authorized to generally discuss deliberations within DOJ or more broadly, within the executive branch, particularly on matters that may be the subject of ongoing investigations. I take those obligations very seriously. And I appreciate the subcommittee’s shared interest in protecting classified information and preserving the integrity of any investigations that the Department of Justice may now be conducting. I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you. GRAHAM: Senator Grassley, would you like to make a statement? SEN. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY,  : (inaudible) GRAHAM: OK. GRASSLEY: I don’t want to. GRAHAM: OK. GRASSLEY: I’ve got questions. GRAHAM: All right, you’ll get to ask them. Senator Feinstein? SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN,  .: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and I’ll be very brief. We have prepared for the committee and I’d like to ask the staff to distribute it, a background and timeline on Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and some of the key dates involved, which may be of help to the subcommittee. And I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the subcommittee, Chairman Graham and  —   and the Ranking Member Whitehouse, I think you’ve done a good job and your whole subcommittee has. And so thank you very, very much. I’d just like to make a few comments, if I might, and put all the remarks in the record. I think it is a foregone conclusion about Russia’s involvement and we see it replicated even in the French election, perhaps not to the extent or in the way, but certainly replicated. On February 9th, 2017, the Washington Post reported that either Flynn had misled the vice president or that Pence had misspoken. Lieutenant General Flynn resigned his post on February 13th, four days after the Post broke this story. There are still many unanswered questions about General Flynn, including who know what  —   who knew what and when. For example, the press is now reporting that in addition to the warning from Sally Yates, concerns were raised by former President Obama directly to then   Trump, 95 days before Flynn resigned. So the question, what role did Flynn play in communications with the Russians, both after the first warning by President Obama and then after the warning by Sally Yates? And I hope to ask that today. What role did Flynn play in   national security decisions, again both during the 95 days and the 18 days when the White House was on notice? So, I look forward to hearing more about this from you, acting Attorney General Yates. You have stated that you warned the White House on January 26, nearly three weeks before Flynn resigned that he had not been truthful and might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. And finally, there are other troubling questions regarding Russia’s relationships and connections with Trump advisors and associates. And there are questions about whether anyone was the target of Russian intelligence, either to be exploited or cultivated. So, I will put my whole remarks in the record, Mr. Chairman. And I hope to ask some questions around these few comments. Thank you very much for this opportunity. GRAHAM: Yes, ma’am, without objections. SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE,  . I.: Mr. Chairman, may I also put into the record a letter dated November 18, 2016 from the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight Government Reform, Representative Elijah Cummings, giving then Vice   Pence notice about certain  —   what he called apparent conflicts of interest regarding General Flynn? GRAHAM: Without objection. General Clapper, on March 5, 2017, you said the following to a question. Here’s the question. Does intelligence exist that can definitely answer the following question, whether there were improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials? You said we did not include any evidence in our report. And I say our, that’s the NSA, the FBI, the CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything  —   that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report. Chuck Todd (ph) then asked, I understand that, but does it exist? You say no, not to my knowledge. Is that still accurate? CLAPPER: It is. GRAHAM: Ms. Yates, do you have any evidence  —   are you aware of any evidence that would suggest that in the 2016 campaign anybody in the Trump campaign colluded  —   colluded with the Russian government intelligence services in improper fashion? YATES: And Senator, my answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information. And so, I  —   I can’t answer that. GRAHAM: Well, I don’t get that because he just said he issued the report. And he said he doesn’t know of any. So, what would you know that’s not in the report? (CROSSTALK) CLAPPER: Are you asking me, or   …     GRAHAM: No, her. CLAPPER: Oh. YATES: Well, I think that Director Clapper also said that he was unaware of the FBI counter intelligence investigations. GRAHAM: Would it be fair to say that the   investigation was not mature enough to come to his  —   to get in the report. Is that fair, Mr.  —   Mr. Clapper? CLAPPER: I  —   that’s an  —   that’s a possibility. GRAHAM: What I don’t get is how the FBI can have a   intelligence investigation suggesting collusion, and you, as director of National Intelligence not know about it, and the FBI sign on to a report that basically said there was no collusion. CLAPPER: I can only speculate why that’s so. There wasn’t  —   the evidence, if there was any, didn’t reach the evidentiary bar in terms of the level of confidence that we were striving for in that intelligence community assessment. GRAHAM: OK, that makes perfect sense to me. Follow up on that, are you familiar with a dossier about Mr. Trump compiled with some guy in England? CLAPPER: I am. GRAHAM: Did you find that to be a credible report? CLAPPER: Well, we didn’t make a judgment on that. And that’s  —   that’s one reason why we did not include it in the body of our intelligence community assessment. GRAHAM: You didn’t find it credible enough to be included? CLAPPER: We couldn’t corroborate the sourcing, particularly the second      sources. GRAHAM: Ms. Yates, are you familiar with the dossier? YATES: ( ) CLAPPER: Microphone. GRAHAM: Microphone. YATES: If I could try to clarify one answer before as well, because I think, Senator Graham, you may have misunderstood me. You asked me whether I was aware of any evidence of collusion, and I declined to answer because answering would reveal classified information. I believe that that’s the same answer that Director Comey gave to this committee when he was asked this question as well. And he made clear, and I’d like to make clear, that just because I say I can’t answer it, you should not draw from that an assumption that that means that the answer is yes. GRAHAM: OK, fair enough. CLAPPER: I also think, if I may, sir, that this illustrates what I was trying to get at in my statement about the unique position that FBI straddles between intelligence and law enforcement. GRAHAM: I just want the country to know that whatever they’re doing on the counterintelligence side, Mr. Clapper didn’t know about it, didn’t make it in the report and we’ll see what comes from it. Ms. Yates, what did you tell the White House about Mr. Flynn? YATES: I had two   meetings and one phone call with the White House Counsel about Mr. Flynn. The first meeting occurred on January 26, called Don McGahn first thing that morning and told him that I had a very sensitive matter that I needed to discuss with him, that I couldn’t talk about it on the phone and that I needed to come see him. And he agreed to meet with me later that afternoon. I took a senior member of the national security division who was overseeing this matter with me to meet with Mr. McGahn. We met in his office at the White House which is a skiff (ph) so we could discuss classified information in his office. We began our meeting telling him that there had been press accounts of statements from the vice president and others that related conduct that Mr. Flynn had been involved in that we knew not to be the truth. And as I   as I tell you what happened here, again I’m going to be very careful not to reveal classified information. GRAHAM: Well the reason you knew it wasn’t true was because you had collected some intelligence from an incidental collection system, is that fair to say? YATES: And I can’t answer that because that again would call me   for me to reveal classified information. GRAHAM: Let me ask you this, did anybody ever make a request to unmask the conversation between the Russian ambassador and Mr. Flynn? YATES: And again, Senator, I can’t answer a question like that, it would call for classified information. .. GRAHAM: . ..Mr. Clapper, do you know if that was the case? CLAPPER: I don’t. GRAHAM: Is there a way to find that out? CLAPPER: Well, in another setting it could be discussed. GRAHAM: But there is a record somewhere of who would make a request to unmask the conversation with General Flynn and the Russian ambassador? CLAPPER: Well, I’m. .. GRAHAM: . ..If one was made, there’d be a record of it? CLAPPER: I can’t speak to this specific case but I can generally comment that in the case of 702 requests, yes, those are all documented. GRAHAM: OK and I don’t mean to interrupt you but this is important to me. How did the conversation between the Russian ambassador and Mr. Flynn make it to the ”Washington Post?” YATES: Which one of us are you asking? GRAHAM: Ms. Yates. CLAPPER: That’s a great question. GRAHAM: I thought so. .. CLAPPER: . ..All of us would like to know that and I don’t know the answer to that. YATES: Yeah. Nor do I know the answer to that. GRAHAM: Is it fair to say that if somebody did make an unmasking request, we would know who they were and we could find out from them who they shared the information with? Is that fair to say, the system would allow us to do what I just described? YATES: Well, unmasking requests are not made to the Department of Justice. GRAHAM: No but to the agency who does the collection. YATES: That’s my understanding is that yes. .. GRAHAM: . ..So there should be a record somewhere in our system whether or not an unmasking request was made for the conversation between Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador. We should be ale to determine if it did   if it was made, who made it. Then we can ask, what did they do with the information? Is that a fair statement, Mr. Clapper? CLAPPER: Yes. GRAHAM: OK. Now what did you finish? What did you tell the White House? YATES: So I told them again that there were a number of press accounts of statements that had been made by the vice president and other   White House officials about General Flynn’s conduct that we knew to be untrue. And we told them how we knew that this   how we had this information, how we had acquired it, and how we knew that it was untrue. And we walked the White House Counsel who also had an associate there with him through General Flynn’s underlying conduct, the contents of which I obviously cannot go through with you today because it’s classified. But we took him through in a fair amount of detail of the underlying conduct, what General Flynn had done, and then we walked through the various press accounts and how it had been falsely reported. We also told the White House Counsel that General Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI on February 24. Mr. McGahn asked me how he did and I declined to give him an answer to that. And we then walked through with Mr. McGahn essentially why we were telling them about this and the first thing we did was to explain to Mr. McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself. Secondly, we told him we felt like the vice president and others were entitled to know that the information that they were conveying to the American people wasn’t true. And we wanted to make it really clear right out of the gate that we were not accusing Vice President Pence of knowingly providing false information to the American people. And, in fact, Mr. McGahn responded back to me to let me know that anything that General Flynn would’ve said would have been based    excuse me    anything that Vice President Pence would have said would have been based on what General Flynn had told him. We told him the third reason was    is because we were concerned that the American people had been misled about the underlying conduct and what General Flynn had done, and additionally, that we weren’t the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done. And the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others, because in the media accounts, it was clear from the vice president and others that they were repeating what General Flynn had told them, and that this was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information. And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians. Finally, we told them that we were giving them all of this information so that they could take action, the action that they deemed appropriate. I remember that Mr. McGahn asked me whether or not General Flynn should be fired, and I told him that that really wasn’t our call, that was up to them, but that we were giving them this information so that they could take action, and that was the first meeting. GRAHAM: Thank you, and I’ll go to Senator Whitehouse    one very quick question. Was. .. YATES: Yeah. GRAHAM: . .. are you either one of you aware of incidental collection by our intelligence community    of any presidential candidate, staff or campaign during the 2016 election cycle? CLAPPER: Say that again, sir. I’m sorry (ph). GRAHAM: Was there any incidental collection, where our intelligence community collects information, involving a presidential candidate on either side of the aisle during 2015 or 2016? CLAPPER: No, not to my knowledge. YATES: I believe Director Comey was also asked this question and declined to answer it, so I’m    I need to follow the same lines the DOJ has drawn. Again, you should not draw from that that my answer is yes, but rather, that the answer would require me to reveal classified information. GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Whitehouse. CLAPPER: My    my response is all within the context of intelligence    foreign intelligence, not the domestic consideration. YATES: ( ) GRAHAM: Exactly. WHITEHOUSE: Following the Comey line, the director testified a few days ago in the full committee that the FBI had interviewed Mr. Flynn a day before, or two days before, your meeting at the White House, and you’ve just testified that you had told the White House counsel that the FBI had interviewed Flynn and he’d asked    McGahn had asked, how’d he do? YATES: Right. WHITEHOUSE: Did you have the 302 with you when you were in the White House? Did you show it to White House counsel? And had you seen it at the time you went up to the White House? YATES: No. The FBI had conducted the interview on the 24th. We got a readout from the FBI on the 25th, a detailed readout specifically from the agents that had conducted the interview. But we didn’t want to wait for the 302, because we felt that it was important to get this information to the White House as quickly as possible, so we had folks from the national security division who spent a lot of time with the agents, not only finding out exactly how the interview went but how this impacted their investigation. WHITEHOUSE: So did you take that summary with you? Do you have any document with you that described the FBI interview of General Flynn? YATES: At the time that I was there, I had notes that described that interview, as well as the individual that was with me    the senior career official from the national security division    had been part of all of those discussions with the FBI. WHITEHOUSE: Did you discuss criminal prosecution of Mr. Flynn    General Flynn? YATES: My recollection is that did not really come up much in the first meeting. It did come up in the second meeting, when Mr. McGahn called me back the next morning and asked the    the morning after    this is the morning of the 27th, now    and asked me if I could come back to his office. And so I went back with the NSD official, and there were essentially four topics that he wanted to discuss there, and one of those topics was precisely that. He asked about the applicability of certain statutes, certain criminal statutes and, more specifically, about. .. WHITEHOUSE: This was (ph) the second meeting at the White House Council’s Office in his office again? YATES: In his office again. WHITEHOUSE: With the same two individuals? YATES: Exactly. WHITEHOUSE: On the following day? YATES: Right. WHITEHOUSE: And you went back pursuant to a phone call request or a    was. .. YATES: Yes, the morning of the 27th after our meeting had occurred on the afternoon of the 26th, the morning of the 27th, Mr. McGahn called me and asked if I could come back to the White House to discuss this further. And we set up a time and I went over there that afternoon, bringing again the same career official with me from the national security division, who was overseeing this investigation. He had the same associate from the White House Council’s Office and we talked through four to five more issues. WHITEHOUSE: You could perhaps have waited until you actually had seen the agents 302 from the interview of General Flynn. Why go ahead of that? Why not wait? YATES: Well, because this was a matter of some urgency, we. .. WHITEHOUSE: Describe. YATES: In making the determination about notification here, we had to balance a variety of interest. For the reasons that I just described a few minutes ago, we felt like it was critical that we get this information to the White House, because in part because the vice president was unknowingly making false statements to the public and because we believed that General Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russians. We were balancing this though, against the FBI’s investigation, as you would always do, and take into account the investigating agency’s desires and concerns about how a notification might impact that ongoing investigation. But once General Flynn was interviewed, there was no longer a concern about an impact on an investigation. WHITEHOUSE: Do you know where that interview took place or under what circumstances? YATES: I believe it took place at the White House. WHITEHOUSE: The Flynn interview? YATES: Yes. WHITEHOUSE: OK. Do you know if Flynn was represented by council at the time? YATES: I don’t believe he was. WHITEHOUSE: OK. And the scenario that you were concerned about was that you were seeing all these statements coming from the White House that were inconsistent with what you knew, you presumed that the White House was being truthful which meant that Flynn was misleading them. YATES: Right. WHITEHOUSE: Which meant that he was vulnerable to manipulation by the Russians, who knowing what had actually taken place could call up the national security advisor to the president and say, you got to do this for us or we’re going to out you with all your folks and your career is done. YATES: That’s right, because one of the questions that Mr. McGahn asked me when I went back over the second day was essentially, why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another White House official? And so we explained to him, it was a whole lot more than that and went back over the same concerns that we had raised with them the prior day, that the concern first about the underlying conduct itself, that he had lied to the vice president and others, the American public had been misled. And then importantly, that every time this lie was repeated and the misrepresentations were getting more and more specific, as    as they were coming out. Every time that happened, it increased the compromise and to state the obvious, you don’t want your national security advisor compromised with the Russians. WHITEHOUSE: Were there any takeaways from the first meeting or action items that you left with? YATES: Well, there was an action item in the second meeting because I got    we talked about several issues but. .. WHITEHOUSE: To get the order right, you said earlier that there were two meetings and a phone call. YATES: Right. WHITEHOUSE: Was the phone call the phone call that set up the second meeting or was there a third. .. YATES: There was a third substantive phone call. There was a. .. WHITEHOUSE: Go ahead, I can. .. YATES: Sorry about that. One of the    one of the issues that Mr. McGahn raised with me in this second meeting that again was on the 27th, the day after the first meeting, was his concern because we had told him before that we were giving him this information so that they could take action. And he said that they were concerned that taking action might interfere with the FBI investigation. And we told him, both the senior career official and I, that he should not be concerned with it, that General Flynn had been interviewed, that their action would not interfere with any investigation and in fact, I remember specifically saying, you know it wouldn’t really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands. WHITEHOUSE: Was the interview of General Flynn accelerated once you became aware of this information and felt you needed to get his statement quickly? YATES: Well, we had wanted to tell the White House as quickly as possible and we’re working with the FBI and in the course of the investigation but certainly, we did. .. (CROSSTALK) WHITEHOUSE: And the first thing you know is that you have information that one thing was said and the White House is saying something different. And you know that that information irrespective of who is involved needs to get up to the White House quickly. And so at that point, the decision was made to do the interview so that that was locked down before you went up to White House counsel? YATES: Right, so that that would not have a negative impact on the FBI investigation at that point. And there was a request made by Mr. McGahn, in the second meeting as to whether or not they would be able to look at the underlying evidence that we had that we had described for him of General Flynn’s conduct. And we told him that we were inclined to allow them to look at that underlying evidence, that we wanted to go back to DOJ and be able to make the logistical arrangements for that. This second meeting on the 27th occurred late in the afternoon, this is Friday the 27th. So we told him that we would work with the FBI over the weekend on this issue and get back with him on Monday morning. And I called him first thing Monday morning to let him know that we would allow them to come over and to review the underlying evidence. WHITEHOUSE: And was that the phone call or is there a separate phone call? YATES: There was the phone call initially to let him know I needed to come see him. WHITEHOUSE: Yeah? YATES: Two meetings and then a phone call at the end to let him know. .. WHITEHOUSE: That the material was available if he wanted to see it. YATES: . .. that the material was available. He had to call me back. He was not available then and I did not hear back from him until that afternoon of Monday the 30th. WHITEHOUSE: And that was the end of this episode, nobody came over to look at the material? YATES: I don’t know what happened after that because that was my last day with DOJ. WHITEHOUSE: Got it. OK. (LAUGHTER) GRAHAM: Senator Grassley. GRASSLEY: Mr. Clapper, you said that you’ve never exposed classified information in an inappropriate manner. I asked Director Comey these questions last week, so for both of you, yes or no. As far as you know, has any classified information relating to Mr. Trump or his associates been declassified and shared with the media? CLAPPER: Not to my knowledge. GRASSLEY: Ms. Yates? YATES: Not to my knowledge either. GRASSLEY: OK. Next question; have either of you ever been an anonymous source in a news report about matters relating to Mr. Trump, his associates or Russia’s attempt to meddle in the election? CLAPPER: No. YATES: Absolutely not. GRASSLEY: OK. Third question; did either of you ever authorize someone else at your respective organizations to be an anonymous source in a news report about Mr. Trump or his associates? CLAPPER: No. YATES: No. GRASSLEY: OK. As far as either of you know, have any government agencies referred any of the leaks over the past several months to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation? CLAPPER: I don’t know. As you know, Senator, there is a process for that    for doing that. I don’t know if that    that’s happened. GRASSLEY: Ms. Yates? YATES: I’m not at DOJ anymore, so I don’t know what’s been referred. GRASSLEY: So then I guess to kind of sum up, neither one of you know whether the department authorized a criminal investigation of the leaks? CLAPPER: I do not, sir. YATES: No, sir. GRASSLEY: OK. Have any of you been questioned by the FBI about any leaks? CLAPPER: I have not been. YATES: No. GRASSLEY: OK. I want to discuss unmasking. Mr. Clapper and Ms. Yates, did either of you ever request the unmasking of Mr. Trump, his associates or any member of Congress? CLAPPER: Yes, in one case I did that I can specifically recall, but I can’t discuss it any further than that. GRASSLEY: You can’t, so if I ask you for details, you said you can’t discuss that, is that what you said? CLAPPER: Not    not here. GRASSLEY: OK. Ms. Yates, can you answer that question? Did you ever request unmasking of Mr. Trump, his associates or any member of Congress? YATES: No. GRASSLEY: Question two. Did either of you ever review classified documents in which Mr. Trump, his associates or members of Congress had been unmasked? CLAPPER: Yes. GRASSLEY: You have? Can you give us details here in this. .. CLAPPER: No, I can’t. GRASSLEY: Ms. Yates, have you? YATES: Yes, I have and no, I can’t give you details. GRASSLEY: OK. Did either of you ever share information about unmasked (ph) Trump associates or members of Congress with anyone else? CLAPPER: Well, I’m thinking back over six and a half years, I could have discussed it with either my deputy or my general counsel. GRASSLEY: Ms. Yates? YATES: In the course of the Flynn matter, I had discussions with other members of the intel community. I’m not sure if that’s responsive to your question. GRASSLEY: And in both cases, you can’t give details here. YATES: No. CLAPPER: No. GRASSLEY: The FBI notified the Democratic National Committee of the Russian’s intrusion into their systems in August of 2015, but the DNC turned down the FBI’s offer to get the Russians out and refused the FBI access to their servers. Instead, it evidently eventually hired a private firm in the spring of 2016. WikiLeaks began releasing the hacked DNC   last July. It took roughly 27, 000 of the 27, 500 DNC   it released were   sent after the FBI notified the DNC of the breach. Mr. Clapper, would you agree that one of the lessons of this episode is that people should cooperate with the FBI when notified of foreign hacks instead of stone walling? CLAPPER: Yes, sir. I generally think that’s a very good idea. GRASSLEY: Mr. Clapper, you sent the Russians    you said the Russians did not release any negative information on Republican candidates. I believe that that’s not quite right. On June the 15th, 2016, Guccifer 2. 0 released to Gawker and The Smoking Gun more than 200 pages of the DNC’s opposition research on Mr. Trump’s    hundreds of pages of what I would call dirt. This happened just two days after The Wall Street Journal published a plan for Republican Convention delegates to revolt to prevent Mr. Trump from securing the nomination. Why wasn’t   why wasn’t the Russian release of harmful information about Mr. Trump addressed in the Russia report? And was this even evaluated during the review? CLAPPER: I would have to consult with the analysts that were involved in the report to definitively answer that. I don’t know personally whether they considered that or not. GRASSLEY: Can you submit that as an answer in writing? CLAPPER: Well, I’m a private citizen now, sir. I don’t know what    what the rules are on my. .. GRASSLEY: Well, give me the name. .. CLAPPER: . .. obtaining classified    potentially classified information, so I will look in to it. GRASSLEY: OK. Mr. Clapper, you testified that the intelligence community conducted an exhaustive review of Russian interference and the analysts involved had complete, unfettered access to all sensitive raw intelligence data. Do you have any reason to believe that any agency withheld any relevant information? CLAPPER: I don’t believe so, with one potential caveat, which is that there is the possibility, again acknowledging this role that the FBI plays in straddling both intelligence and law enforcement, that for whatever reason they may have chosen to withhold investigatory sensitive information from the report. I don’t know that to be a fact. I was not apprised of that, I’m just suggesting that as a possibility. GRASSLEY: My time’s up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. GRAHAM: Thank you. Senator Feinstein. FEINSTEIN: Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Yates, I’m not going to ask you anything that deserves a confidential or secure answer, but after your second   meeting with Mr. McGahn, you said there were four topics he wanted to discuss. Would you list those four topics? YATES: Sure. The first topic in the second meeting was essentially why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another. The second topic related to the applicability of criminal statutes and the likelihood that the Department of Justice would pursue a criminal case. The third topic was his concern that their taking action might interfere with an investigation of Mr. Flynn. And the fourth topic was his request to see the underlying evidence. FEINSTEIN: Were all those topics satisfied with respect to your impression after the second meeting? YATES: Yes. The only thing that was really left open there would (ph)    was the logistics, for us to be able to make arrangements for them to look at the underlying evidence. FEINSTEIN: And you did make those arrangements? YATES: We did make those arrangements, but again, I don’t know whether that ever happened, whether they ever looked at. .. FEINSTEIN: OK. YATES: . .. that evidence or not. FEINSTEIN: Fair enough. Apparently, Lieutenant General Flynn remained national security adviser for 18 days after you raised the Justice Department’s concern. In your view, during those 18 days, did the risk that Flynn had been or could be compromised diminish at all? YATES: You know, I don’t know that I’m in a position to really have an answer for that. I know that we were really concerned about the compromise here, and that was the reason why we were encouraging them to act. I don’t know what steps they may have taken, if any, during that 18 days to minimize any risk. FEINSTEIN: Well, did you discuss this with other DOJ career professionals? YATES: Certainly, leading up to our notification on the 26th. It was a topic of a whole lot of discussion, in DOJ and with other members of the intel community, and we discussed it at great length. But after the 30th, again, I wasn’t at DOJ anymore, so I didn’t have any further discussions after that point about what was being done with respect to that. FEINSTEIN: Did you consult with other career prosecutors? YATES: Absolutely. We had, really, the experts within the national security division. As we were navigating this situation, they were working with the FBI on the investigation, and we were trying to make a determination about how best to make this notification so that we could get the information to the White House that they needed to be able to act. FEINSTEIN: So what’s the point that you were trying to make    yes or no will be fine    that General Flynn had seriously compromised the security of the United States, and possibly the government, by what he had done, whatever that was? YATES: Well, our point was    is that logic would tell you that you don’t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the Russians have leverage over him. Now, in terms of what impact that may have or could have had, I can’t speak to that, but we knew that was not a good situation, which is why we wanted to let the White House know about it. FEINSTEIN: The Guardian has reported that Britain’s intelligence service first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious interactions between Trump advisers and Russian intelligence agents. This information was passed on to U. S. intelligence agencies. Over the spring of 2016, multiple European allies passed on additional information to the United States about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians. Is this accurate? YATES: I    I can’t answer that. FEINSTEIN: General Clapper, is that accurate? CLAPPER: Yes, it is and it’s also quite sensitive. FEINSTEIN: OK. Let me ask you this. CLAPPER: The specifics are    are     are quite sensitive. FEINSTEIN: When did components of the intelligence community open investigations into the interactions between trump advisers and Russians? What was the question again, ma’am, I’m sorry? FEINSTEIN: When did components of the intelligence community open investigations into the interactions between Trump advisers and Russians? CLAPPER: What was the question, again, Ma’am? I’m sorry. FEINSTEIN: When did components of the intelligence community open investigations into the interactions between Trump advisers and Russians? CLAPPER: Well, I can    I refer to Director Comey’s statement before the House Intelligence Committee on the 20th of March    is when he advised that they’d open an investigation in July of ’16. FEINSTEIN: And what was the reaction when you advised that the investigation be opened as early as July 15th? CLAPPER: I’m sorry? FEINSTEIN: I    I thought you said that you advised on July. .. CLAPPER: No, Director Comey did, before the House Intelligence Committee. .. FEINSTEIN: The director (ph)    I see. CLAPPER: . .. announced that the FBI had initiated investigation in July of 2016. FEINSTEIN: Well, what did the intelligence agencies do with the findings that I just spoke about that The Guardian wrote about? CLAPPER: Well, I’m not sure about the accuracy of that article, so clearly over actually going back to 2015, there was evidence of Soviet, excuse me, Freudian slip, Russian activity. Mainly, in an information gathering or recon ordering mode, where they were investigating voter registration rolls and the like. And that activity started early, and so, we were monitoring this as it progressed, and certainly as it picked up, accelerated in spring, summer and fall of 2016. FEINSTEIN: OK. So let me go back to you, Miss Yates, I take it you were very concerned. What was your prime worry during all of this? Now, you were worried that General Flynn would be compromised? What did you think would happen, if he were, and how do you believe he would have been compromised? YATES: Well, we had two concerns, compromise was certainly the number one concern and the Russians can use compromised material, information, in a variety of ways, sometimes overtly and sometimes subtly. And again, our concern was, is that you have a very sensitive position, like the National Security advisor and you don’t want that person to be in a position, where again, the Russians have leverage over him. But, I will also say, another motivating factor is that we felt like the Vice President was entitled to know that the information he had been given, and that he was relaying to the American public, wasn’t true. FEINSTEIN: So, what’s you’re saying is that General Flynn lied to the Vice President? YATES: That’s certainly how it appeared, yes, because the Vice President went out and made statements about General Flynn’s conduct, that he said were based on what General Flynn had told him, and we knew that that just flat wasn’t true. FEINSTEIN: Well, as the days went on, what was your view of the situation? Because there were, I guess two weeks before, or was it 18 days before Director Flynn was dismissed? YATES: Well, again, I was no longer with DOJ after the 30th, and so I wasn’t having interaction or any involvement in this issue after that day. FEINSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. GRAHAM: Senator Cornyn. SEN. JOHN CORNYN,  : Thank you, Chairman Graham. And Senator Whitehouse, for today’s hearing. This is important, the American people have every right to know as much as possible about Russian interference in our elections. But, as I think, as the Director has told us before many times, this is not anything new. Although, perhaps, the level and intensity, and the sophistication, of both Russian overt and covert operations is really unprecedented, and I thank the intelligence community for their assessment. I do regret that, while these two witnesses are certainly welcomed and we’re glad to have them here, that former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, has refused to testify in front of the Committee. It seems to me, there are a lot of questions that she needs to answer. I would point out, though, Mr. Chairman, that both Senator Feinstein and I, are fortunate enough to be on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also conducting a bipartisan investigation under the leadership of Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Warner. One of the benefits of that additional investigation, is that we have been given access to the raw intelligence collected by the intelligence community, which I think, completes what understandably is an incomplete picture. When you can only talk in a public setting about part of the evidence, but it is important for the American people to understand what’s happening. I think this subcommittee hearing is playing an important role in that. I want to ask Director Clapper, because, I think, unfortunately some of the discussion about unmasking is casting suspicion on the intelligence community in a way that I think is, frankly, concerning. Particularly when we’re looking at reauthorizing Section 702 of the Patriot Act by the end of next year. because as many have said, I can’t recall your specific words, but I know Director Comey has called that the crown jewels of the intelligence community, and I’m very concerned that some of the information that’s been discussed about unmasking, for example, might cause some people to worry about their legitimate privacy concerns. CORNYN: So when it comes to incidental collection on an American person, and that is unmasked at the request of some appropriate authority, can you describe, briefly, the paper trail and the series    and the approval process that is required in order to allow that to happen? That’s not a trivial matter, is it? CLAPPER: The    and the    the process is that, first of all, the judgment as to whether or not to unmask or reveal the identity is rendered by the original collection agency so normally that’s going to be, in the case of 702    going to be NSA. And I know, for my part, because, as I indicated in my statement, over my six and a half years of DNI, I occasionally ask for identities to be unmasked to understand the context. What I was concerned about, and those of us in the intelligence community are concerned about, is the behavior of the    the validated foreign intelligence target. Is that target trying to   recruit, bribe, penetrate or what? And it’s very difficult to understand that context by the labels ”U. S. person one,” ”U. S. person two.” And as well, I should point out, doing that on an anecdotal basis, one SIGINT report at a time, in which you need to look at is there a    is there a pattern here, and so I tried on my part to be very, very judicious about that. It’s a very sensitive thing. But I did feel an obligation, as DNI, that I should attempt to understand the context and who this person was, because that had a huge bearing on how important or critical it was, and what threat might be posed by virtue of the    again, the behavior of the validated foreign intelligence target. So our focus was on the target, not    not as much as the U. S. person    only to understand the context. CORNYN: Well, the fact that some appropriate authority might request and receive the unmasking of the name of the U. S. person does not then authorize the release of that information    that classified information    into the public domain? that remains a crime, does it not? CLAPPER: Yes. Again, that’s why I attempted to make    to clarify, in my statement. .. (CROSSTALK) CORNYN (? ): Push the button. CLAPPER: That’s why, in my statement, I attempted to make that distinction between unmasking, an authorized, legitimate process with approval by the appropriate authorities, and leaking, which is an unauthorized process under any circumstance. CORNYN: Mr. Chairman, I think it’s really important that, in order to determine who actually requested the unmasking, and in order to establish whether appropriate procedures were undertaken under both legislative oversight and judicial oversight, that we determine what that paper trail is and follow it. .. CLAPPER: Senator Cornyn, if I may, I just    and I have to be very careful here about how I phrase this, but I would just repeat to you the definition of what 702 is used for. .. CORNYN: Foreign intelligence (ph). CLAPPER: . .. which is collection against a  . S. person overseas. CORNYN: I don’t think you can say that enough, Director Clapper. It’s important, because people need to understand that. .. CLAPPER: Happy to say it again. CORNYN: . .. we are both getting necessary foreign intelligence. .. (CROSSTALK) CORNYN: . .. to keep the American people safe, but also respecting the privacy rights and the constitutional rights of American citizens. CLAPPER: Absolutely. CORNYN: Ms. Yates, this is the first time that you’ve appeared before Congress since you left the Department of Justice, and I just wanted to ask you a question about the    your decision to refuse to defend the president’s executive order. In the letter that you sent to Congress, you point out that the executive order itself was drafted in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel, and you point out that the Office of Legal Counsel reviewed it to determine whether, in its view, the proposed executive order was lawful on its face and properly drafted. Is it true that the Office of Legal Counsel did conclude it was lawful on its face and properly drafted? YATES: Yes, they did. The office of. .. CORNYN: And you overruled them? YATES: . .. I did. The office of legal. .. CORNYN: Did you (ph)    what    what is your authority to    to overrule the Office of Legal Counsel when it comes to a legal determination? YATES: The Office of Legal Counsel has a narrow function, and that is to look at the face of an executive order and to determine purely on its face whether there is some set of circumstances under which at least some part of the executive order may be lawful. And importantly, they do not look beyond the face of the executive order, for example, statement that are made contemporaneously or prior to the execution of the E. O. that may bear on its intent and purpose. That office does not look at those factors, and in determining the constitutionality of this executive order, that was an important analysis to engage in and one that I did. CORNYN: Well, Ms. Yates, I thought the Department of Justice had a long standing tradition of defending a presidential action in court if there are reasonable arguments in its favor, regardless whether those arguments might prove to be ultimately persuasive, which of course is up to the courts to decide and not you, correct? YATES: It is correct that often times, but not always, the civil division of the Department of Justice will defend an action of the president or an action of Congress if there is a reasonable argument to be made. But in this instance, all   all arguments have to be based on truth because we’re the Department of Justice. We’re not just a law firm, we’re the Department of Justice and the. .. (CROSSTALK) CORNYN: You distinguish the truth from lawful? YATES: Yes, because in this instance, in looking at what the intent was of the executive order, which was derived in part from an analysis of facts outside the face of the order, that is part of what led to our conclusion that it was not lawful, yes. CORNYN: Well, Ms. Yates, you had a distinguished career for 27 years at the Department of Justice and I voted for your confirmation because I believed that you had a distinguished career. But I have to tell you that I find it enormously disappointing that you somehow vetoed the decision of the Office of Legal Counsel with regard to the lawfulness of the president’s order and decided instead that you would counter man (ph) the executive order of the president of the United States because you happen to disagree with it as a policy matter. YATES: Well, it was. .. CORNYN: I just have to say that. YATES: I appreciate that, Senator, and let me make one thing clear. It is not purely as a policy matter. In fact, I’ll remember my confirmation hearing. In an exchange that I had with you and others of your colleagues where you specifically asked me in that hearing that if the president asked me to do something that was unlawful or unconstitutional and one of your colleagues said or even just that would reflect poorly on the Department of Justice, would I say no? And I looked at this, I made a determination that I believed that it was unlawful. I also thought that it was inconsistent with principles of the Department of Justice and I said no. And that’s what I promised you I would do and that’s what I did. CORNYN: I don’t know how you can say that it was lawful and say that it was within your prerogative to refuse to defend it in a court of law and leave it to the court to decide. YATES: Senator, I did not say it was lawful. I said it was unlawful. GRAHAM: Senator Durbin is next, but I have one quick, if you don’t mind Senator Durbin, about how 702 works. You said something, General Clapper, I don’t quite understand. Is it unlawful to surveil with a FISA warrant a foreign agent in the United States? CLAPPER: No, it’s not. But that’s another provision. I was   I was saying. .. GRAHAM: OK. CLAPPER: I was saying what 702 does. GRAHAM: I just want to make sure there is a procedure to do that. CLAPPTER: There is. GRAHAM: OK. Senator Durbin? (UNKNOWN): Just to your point, you said the word overseas. Ambassador Kislyak was not overseas on December 29th, was he? CLAPPER: That’s correct. (UNKNOWN): Thank you. SEN. RICHARD J. DURBIN,  .: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me say at the outset in response to Senator Cornyn, in your conclusion about the unlawful nature of the Muslim travel ban was, of course, a position which was supported by three different federal courts that stopped the enforcement of that ban and ultimately led to the president withdrawing that particular travel ban. Is that not true? YATES: That’s correct. DURBIN: Thank you. I want to mention at the outset here that this is a critically important hearing and I want to thank Senator Graham and Senator Whitehouse for the bipartisan nature and the cooperation in this hearing. I think the testimony we’ve received from these witnesses and the presence of so many other of my colleagues is an indication of how we view the severity and gravity of the issue before us. I’m troubled that this great committee with its great chairman and all its members does not have professional staff assigned to this investigation. It’s the ordinary staff of the subcommittee who are working it. I think that what we have seen with this situation calls for the appointment of an independent commission, presidential commission or congressional commission, one that is clearly independent, transparent and can get to the bottom of the Russian involvement in our last election process and the threat that faces    we face in the future because of it. Short of that, we’ll continue to do our best on a committee level with meager resources in both the Intelligence Committee and here. And this is, I think, an issue that begs for so much more. I might also say that I’m starting to hear from the Republican side of the table some real concerns about Section 702, which Senator Lee, Republican member of the committee and myself, have been calling for reform on for several years. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the support from the other side of the table when we did. I hope that we can get it now when we talk about real reform to (ph) the 702 and protecting the rights of individuals in America. Ms. Yates, let me ask you about this meeting on January the 26th with White House Counsel Don McGahn. You shared the Justice Department’s concern about his communications with Russia, his apparent dishonesty about those communications and his vulnerability to blackmail. Is that correct? YATES: That’s right. DURBIN: Was there anything else about the relationship of General Flynn and the Russians other than his representations that he had no conversation that you warned Don McGahn about? YATES: No. DURBIN: So it didn’t go back to his trip to Moscow, money received and so forth? YATES: No, it did not. DURBIN: It was strictly on that question? YATES: Yes. DURBIN: And then you had a second meeting the next day. YATES: That’s right. DURBIN: Is that correct, on January 27th? YATES: At his request, yes. DURBIN: At Mr. McGahn’s request. And at that second meeting, did Mr. McGahn say anything about whether he had taken the information you’d given him the previous day to the president? YATES: No, he didn’t tell us. DURBIN: Are you aware of the fact that Mr. Spicer, the White House press secretary, on February 14th said, and I quote, ”Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House counsel of the situation, the White House counsel briefed the president and a small group of senior advisors?” YATES: I’ve seen media reports to that effect, but that’s all I know is from the media. DURBIN: So there was no statement by Mr. McGahn that he had either spoken to the president about your concerns with his national security advisor or with any other members of the White House? YATES: No, he didn’t advise us in the second meeting anyone he may have discussed this with the prior evening. DURBIN: I guess I want to also go to the question which keeps gnawing at me here that Mr. McGahn asked of you. Is there anything wrong with one White House official lying to another White House official? YATES: Well, to be fair to Mr. McGahn here, I wouldn’t say that he said is there anything wrong. His question was more essentially what’s it to the Justice Department if one White House official is lying to another? In other words, why is this something that DOJ would be concerned about? And that’s why went back through the list of issues and reasons why this was troubling to us. DURBIN: Did you think there was a legal reason to be concerned if one White House official lied to another White House official? YATES: We didn’t go into that. And to the extent you may be talking about like 1001 violation, that was not something that we were alluding to or discussing with Mr. McGahn. I think his point when he made that point to me was that he wasn’t sure why the Department of Justice would care about one lying to another, not to be discussing whether that was in fact a crime. DURBIN: And the reason you told him was what? YATES: Was that, again, it was a whole lot more than one White House official lying to another. First of all, it was the vice president of the United States and the vice president had then gone out and provided that information to the American people who had then been misled and the Russians knew all of this, making Mike Flynn compromised now. DURBIN: You said earlier, I believe, that Mr. McGahn asked you if you thought they should fire General Flynn at that point. YATES: Right. DURBIN: And what was your response? YATES: Told him that it was not our call as to whether General Flynn was fired, that we were giving them this information so that they could take action, the action that they believed was appropriate. DURBIN: On February 14th, after General Flynn resigned, Sean Spicer said, and I quote, ”There was nothing in what General Flynn did in terms of conducting himself that was an issue.” Do you have any idea what he meant by those words? YATES: No. I’m not    all I can say is he didn’t reach that conclusion from his conversation with us. I can’t speak to how he arrived at that. DURBIN: Let me ask you, there was a period of time, 18 days, that we’ve referred to (inaudible) and during that period of 18 days, a number of things occurred; General Glynn continued to serve as the national security advisor for 18 days after you had briefed the White House about the counterintelligence risk that he posed. And during those 18 days, General Flynn continued to hire key senior staff on the National Security Council, announced new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile program, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe along with President Trump at    and participated in discussions about responding to a North Korean missile launch and spoke repeatedly to the press about his communications with Russian Ambassador Kisliak. DURBIN: Ms. Yates, in    in your view, were there national security concerns in these decisions being made after the information you shared with the White House? YATES: I was no long with DOJ after January 30th, so I wasn’t aware of any actions that the General Flynn was taking. So I    I couldn’t really opine on that. DURBIN: General Clapper? Would you comment? If you had the warning from the White House    pardon me, from the Department of Justice to the White House about General Flynn possibly being compromised here, and then these important national security decisions had followed, would you have concern about that? CLAPPER: Well, I would. Hypothetically, yes. I mean, again, I was gone from the government as well when all this happened. DURBIN: But    but you’ve had quite a career in intelligence and national security. And here, you have a man that’s been told    the White House has been told his    he could be compromised and blackmailed by the Russians    continuing to make the highest level decisions of our government. CLAPPER: Well, that’s    that’s    it is certainly a potential vulnerability, there’s no question about it. DURBIN: I would say so. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. GRAHAM: ( ) SEN. TED CRUZ,  : Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the witnesses for being here today. Mr. Clapper, you    you testified as to the harms that come from leaks    the harms that come to our national security    and you also testified about the importance of protecting classified information and keeping it classified. During your many years in intelligence, and at the DNI, have you ever knowingly forwarded classified information to a   employee on a   computer who did not have authorization to receive that information? CLAPPER: Not to my    not to my recollection, no, sir. CRUZ: And, Director Clapper, what would you do, at the DNI, if you discovered that an employee of yours had forwarded hundreds or even thousands of   to a   individual, their spouse, on a   computer? CLAPPER: Well, you know, I’m not a investigatory or prosecutorial element. But if I were aware of it, I would certainly make known to the appropriate officials that that was going on. CRUZ: Would that strike you as anything ordinary? CLAPPER: Hopefully not. CRUZ: What    what concerns would that raise for you? CLAPPER: Well, it raises all kinds of potential security concerns. Again, depending on    on the    the content of the   what the intent was, there’s a whole bunch of variables here that would have to be considered. But, you know, potentially, and again, this is a hypothetical scenario, it could be quite concerning. CRUZ: What would you expect to happen if you made a referral of an individual who had forwarded hundreds or even thousands of classified information. .. CLAPPER: Well. .. CRUZ: . .. to a   employee. .. CLAPPER: . .. whether (ph). .. CRUZ: . .. on a   computer? CLAPPER: . .. whatever the transgression    potential transgression was, if there were sufficient evidence of a compromise, we would file a crimes report. That’s standard procedure that we use when there’s the potential for investigating and prosecuting someone. CRUZ: Last week, I asked similar questions to FBI Director Comey, and    and he said an individual who did that would be subject to, quote, ”significant administrative discipline,” but that he was highly confident they wouldn’t be prosecuted. Do you share that assessment? CLAPPER: Well, I don’t    I    I don’t know. I think the    the track record is that the prior administration, I think, prosecuted more people for leaking than anyone in any    in any other administration in the past. So it’s difficult to do that. And there are many cases we could not prosecute or even seek a crimes report because the potential audience of people that could have been the perpetrator of    of    of these insecurities could not be identified. CRUZ: It is true that other individuals who were not the direct employee of the Democratic nominee for president were prosecuted for that conduct. Let me    let me shift to a different topic. Director Clapper, you    you also testified that you’re not aware of any intercepted communications of any presidential candidates or campaigns, other than the Trump campaign that’s been discussed here. Is    is that correct? CLAPPER: Yes. But that’s to my knowledge. But, you know, prior administrations, prior campaigns    they wouldn’t have been visible to me. So I    I can’t    I can’t say. .. CRUZ: But    but in 2016, you’re not aware any other campaigns or candidates? CLAPPER: . .. no. CRUZ: And, Ms. Yates, same question to you. YATES: I’m not aware of any interceptions of the Trump campaign. CRUZ: And are you aware of any intercepted communications of any other candidates or campaigns? YATES: No. CRUZ: Okay. Because earlier, when Chairman Graham had asked you that, I    I thought you’d declined to answer. So perhaps I misunderstood that. YATES: And I may have misunderstood the question. I thought the question I declined to answer was a different one than that. So I’m    I’m glad I got a chance to clear it up. CRUZ: OK. So you have no information of any interceptions of the Bernie Sanders campaign, Hillary Clinton campaign. .. YATES: No. CRUZ: . .. or any other candidate. .. YATES: No. CRUZ: . .. in 2016, or campaigns? YATES: No. CRUZ: OK. Let’ revisit the topic, Ms. Yates, that    that you and Senator Cornyn were talking about. YATES: OK. CRUZ: It is correct that the constitution vests the executive authority in the president? YATES: Yes. CRUZ: And if an attorney general disagrees with a policy decision of the president    a policy decision that is lawful    does the attorney general have the authority to direct the Department of Justice to defy the president’s order? YATES: I don’t know whether the attorney general has the authority to do that or not. But I don’t think it would be a good idea. And that’s not what I did in this case. CRUZ: Well, are you familiar with 8 USC Section 1182? YATES: Not off the top of my head, no. CRUZ: Well, it    it    it is the binding statutory authority for the executive order that you refused to implement, and that led to your termination. So it    it certainly is a relevant and not a terribly obscure statute. By the express text of the statute, it says, quote, ”whenever the president finds that entry of any alien or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interest of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or   or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem appropriate.” Would you agree that is broad statutory authorization? YATES: I would, and I am familiar with that. And I’m also familiar with an additional provision of the INA that says no person shall receive preference or be discriminated against an issuance of a visa because of race, nationality or place of birth, that I believe was promulgated after the statute that you just quoted. And that’s been part of the discussion with the courts, with respect to the INA, is whether this more specific statute trumps the first one that you just described. (CROSSTALK) YATES: But my concern was not an INA concern here. It, rather, was a constitutional concern, whether or not this    the executive order here violated the Constitution, specifically with the establishment clause and equal protection and due process. CRUZ: There is no doubt the arguments you laid out are arguments that we could expect litigants to bring, partisan litigants who disagree with the policy decision of the president. I would note, on January 27th, 2017, the Department of Justice issued an official legal decision, a determination by the Office of Legal Counsel, that the executive order    and I’ll quote from the opinion    ”the proposed order is approved with respect to form and legality.” That’s a determination from OLC on January 27th that it was legal. Three days later, you determined, using your own words, that although OLC had    had opined on legality, it had not addressed whether it was, quote, ”wise or just.” YATES: And I also, in that same directive, Senator, said that I was not convinced it was lawful. I also made the point that the office of    OLC looks purely at the face of the document and, again, makes a determination as to whether there is some set of circumstances under which some portion of that E. O. would be enforceable, would be lawful. They, importantly, do not look outside the face of the document. And in this particular instance, particularly where we were talking about a fundamental issue of religious freedom    not the interpretation of some arcane statute, but religious freedom    it was appropriate for us to look at the intent behind the president’s actions, and the intent is laid in and out his statements. CRUZ: A final, very    very brief question. In the over 200 years of the Department of Justice history, are you aware of any instance in which the Department of Justice has formally approved the legality of a policy, and three days later, the attorney general has directed the department not to follow that policy, and to defy that policy? YATES: I’m not. But I’m also not aware of a situation where the Office of Legal Counsel was advised not to tell the attorney general about it until after it was over. CRUZ: Thank you, Ms. Yates. I    I    I would note, that might be the case, if there’s reason to suspect partisanship. GRAHAM: Senator Klobuchar. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. I want to thank you very much for your service Ms. Yates. From beginning to end your distinguished career as a prosecutor and I just was putting this time table together and I realize that you’re second meeting, when you went over to the white house to warn them of General Flynn’s line, and his connections with Russia was the same day that this Refugee order came out and it was the same day that you had to leave the justice department. So you    when did you meet with the White House council on that day? YATES: I met with White House Council as best as I can recall about 3:00 in the afternoon on the 30th. KLOBUCHAR: And during that meeting did they mention    anyone mention that this refugee order was about to come out? YATES: No. KLOBUCHAR: Did the acting Attorney General of the United States? YATES: No and that was one thing that was of concern to us, is that not only was department leadership not consulted here and beyond department leadership, really the subject matter experts, the national security experts, not only was the department not consulted, we weren’t even told about it. I learned about this from media reports. KLOBUCHAR: So you learned about it after the meeting at the White house Council from the media. YATES: Right. KLOBUCHAR: And then it’s true that during your hearing, then Senator Sessions, now the Attorney General actually asked you if the views the President wants to execute are unlawful, should the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General say no? And what did you say? YATES: And I said yes, the Attorney General should. KLOBUCHAR: And then moving forward here, as was mentioned by Senator Durbin, this order was (inaudible) after a lawsuit from the State of Washington and Minnesota, the court basically challenged    the constitutionality of the order. The order is now taken effect, but what I want to get to right now is the fact that the administration then withdrew its request for an appeal of the court ruling blocking implementation of the same order and then they changed the order that you would not implement. YATES: Right. And there were a number of important distinctions between travel ban one and travel ban two. At the time I had to make my decision for example, the executive order still applied to green card holders, lawful permanent residents and those who had visas. There were a number of other distinctions as well. And look, let me say . .. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. YATES: Oh, OK sorry. KLOBUCHAR: I want to get on to    but go ahead very quickly. YATES: Look I understand that, you know people of good will and    who are good folks can make different decisions about this. I understand that. But all I can say is that I did my job the best way I knew how. I looked at this E. O. I looked at the law, I talked with the folks at the Department of Justice, gathered them all to get their views and their input and I did my job. KLOBUCHAR: OK. I appreciate that. Let’s go to Russia. December 29th, this is the date that actually Senator Graham and I were with Senator McCain hearing about Russian interference, meeting with leaders in the Baltic’s, Georgia and Ukraine. This is the date that the President expanded the sanctions against Russia and this is the date that Michael Flynn reportedly talked to the Russians, perhaps several times about sanctions. He then went on to not tell the truth to the Vice President. And one of the White House officials has described the notification that you provided warning them of this as a heads up. How would you describe a  ? YATES: Well at the risk of trying to characterize. I mean we were there to tell the White House about something we were very concerned about and emphasized to them repeatedly. It was so they could take action. KLOBUCHAR: So it was much more formal than just a simple hey this is happening. Michael Flynn did not resign his position as national security advisor until February 13th. That is 18 days after you went over there with a formal warning. And in particular after they knew about this on January 28th Flynn was allowed to join President Trump on an hour long telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Do you have any doubt that the information that you conveyed to the White House on January 26th should have been made clear that Flynn had been potentially compromised by Russia? That this information was clear? YATES: Well the purpose in our telling them again was so that they could act and so that they could convey that information. So I would hope that they did. KLOBUCHAR: If a high ranking national security official is caught on tape with a foreign official saying on thing in private and then caught in public saying another thing to the Vice President, is that material for blackmail? YATES: Certainly. KLOBUCHAR: Do you want to add anything to that Director Clapper? CLAPPER: No (inaudible). KLOBUCHAR: OK. I think it’s pretty clear. And I think it’s pretty clear why we had this hearing today. I wanted to ask you, Director Clapper, a few things about just in general this Russian influence. When Director Comey was here last week, he said, ”I think that one of the lessons that the Russians may have drawn from this,” he’s talking about the election influence, ”is that this works.” Those were Comey’s words, do you agree? CLAPPER: Absolutely. And as I said in my statement, the Russians have to be celebrating the success of what    for what they set out do with rather minimal resource expenditure. And the first objective was to sow discord and dissension, which they certainly did. KLOBUCHAR: And when you look at this, in addition to the hacking into the DNC and Podesta’s   all of those things, we also had the fake news propaganda, which is referenced in the report. I believe it’s $200 million, is that all they spent in the scheme of things? Something like that? CLAPPER: If that, which doesn’t include government support to    subsidies to RT. KLOBUCHAR: And how does RT work, when you look at this? CLAPPER: Well, RT is essentially a propaganda mouthpiece for the government, since the predominance of its funding comes from the government and the management is close to Putin. So it’s, as I say, I think a governmental    Russian governmental mouthpiece. KLOBUCHAR: Ms. Yates, I’m asking you in your capacity as a former attorney general and deputy attorney general, I would ask this of Director Comey, about the use of shell corporations. Now something like 50 percent real estate deals over $5 million are now done with shell corporations. We’re trying to push so that the Treasury Department puts more transparency. This is something that European countries are working on right now. And I’m very concerned that this is another vehicle where money is laundered. I’m concerned about loopholes in our campaign finance laws as well. But could you address this just from your experience as a criminal prosecutor? YATES: Sure. And those are all valid concerns. We’re actually lagging behind other countries in the world. And we don’t want to become a haven then where you can have shell corporations that can be used for all sorts of nefarious purposes. They can have national security implications as well as criminal implications. KLOBUCHAR: Director Clapper, did you want to add anything to that? And, again, this is why I believe an independent commission    in addition to the great work that’s being done by this subcommittee and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is so important, as well as the investigation, an independent commission would allow a panel of experts to go into the next election, go into 2020, where Director Comey had said ”I expect to see them back in 2018 and especially 2020.” Those are his words. Do you agree with that, Director? CLAPPER: Absolutely. KLOBUCHAR: And that is why an independent commission would allow us to come up with some ideas and how we can stop this from happening again, whether it is how the media handled these things, how campaigns handled these things, how intelligence agencies, when they find out, handle these things, because we cannot allow foreign countries to influence our democracies. Do you agree, Director Clapper? CLAPPER: I certainly do. And I understand how critical leaks are and unmasking and all these ancillary issues. But to me, the transcendent issue here is the Russian interference in our election process, and what that means to the erosion of the fundamental fabric of our democracy. And that to me is a huge deal. And they’re going to continue to do it. And why not? It proved successful. KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. GRAHAM: Until they pay a price, I hope which they will soon pay. Senator Sasse? SASSE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, both, for being here. Director Clapper, how likely do you think it is that foreign intelligence services are trying to compromise congressional IT systems? CLAPPER: Well, I think that’s    congressional IT systems are a target, and have been. And certainly I saw examples of that during my time as DNI and then the    this is one case where we expeditiously informed the Congress when we saw evidence of that. And, again, that’s not just Russians, there are others out there doing the same thing. SASSE: And what intel value would it provide to them? CLAPPER: Well, depending on the nature of the material that they’ve purloined, it could be quite sensitive. That    hard to make a general statement about it. But just as a general rule, it could be quite damaging. SASSE: And could you talk a little bit about the relationship between that particular intel gathering on legislators and the interface with propaganda campaigns such as you say Russia? I’ve heard you testify in other places about Russia’s activity among their near neighbors. What is the relationship between propaganda and director intel gathering? CLAPPER: You mean, on the part of the Russians? SASSE: Yes, on their neighbors. CLAPPER: Well, they would certainly use that, as they have and examples of that in places like Georgia and the Baltics where they will turn evidence that or    or what they’ve gathered and use that as    as leverage or if they can, to use kompromat (ph) the    the Russian acronym for compromise of material or the real tribes (ph) so there’s all kinds of nefarious things they can potentially do if    if they gather information like that. SASSE: One of    one of the unhelpful ways that we talked about this issue in the present context in D. C.’s polarized context, is it’s almost always retrospective about our election in 2016. And so it devolves into a shirts and skins exercise about what candidate you allegedly supported. Director Comey last week said he expects as Senator Klobuchar just quoted him, he expects the Russians to be back in 2018 and back with a vengeance in 2020. I think it would be helpful for the American people to understand what Russia does among its near neighbors now. So could you unpack a little bit more of how that works? CLAPPER: Well, they’re    if anything, in many ways, particularly those countries that were in the former soviet orbit which they still feel, shall I say, paternal about. And so places like Moldova, or the Baltics, Georgia, they are very aggressive in using all the multitude of tools that were on Senator Whitehouse’s checklist, wherever they can, however they can, to influence the outcome of elections towards candidates of for whatever office whom they think will be more pliant with them. And    and of course, what’s new and different here is that    that aggressiveness is    is spreading into Western Europe. As we’ve seen I believe in France and will in Germany. And    and their relatives, in their minds success at doing this is simply going to reinforce. So all the tools available to them, active propaganda, financing, candidates sympathetic to    to their cause, trolls, hacking, revelations of    of confidential   whatever it is, they’ll    they’ll use that fairly well (ph). SASSE: And could you give us some sense of the    without revealing classified information, the order of magnitude of their financial investment in these kind of efforts? If you’re a near neighbor of Russia and you’ve got your Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines then you might have a little bit of an Intel community and a little bit of a    of a sort of Intel ops, info ops campaign going. How does    what is the Russian investment? CLAPPER: Well, I can’t    I can’t give you a figure. I will say though that in    in comparison to a classical military expenditures, its    it’s a bargain for them. And of course, what they’re looking for particularly in Europe is so dissension, split unity, and of course end sanctions. And if they can drive wedges between and among the European nations by and particularly by their manipulating and influencing elections, they’re going to do it. SASSE: Director, do you stand by the IC’s January assessment that WikiLeaks is a known propaganda platform for Russia? CLAPPER: Absolutely, and I am in agreement with Director Pompeo’s characterization of WikiLeaks as a   state intelligence service. SASSE: Unpack that a little bit more, if that’s the case, then you’re saying that Julian Assange is not a journalist. CLAPPER: You’re asking the wrong guy a question like that, absolutely not. SASSE: I mean, reasonable people in the American debate are worried when they hear people in the IC talk about something that sounds like its just information. I’m obviously highly skeptical of Mr. Assange and I’ve been pushing the Justice Department to ask why we have not been taking steps to prosecute him for particular crimes that have endangered American intelligence assets. But across the continuum of journalists who are legitimate journalists who are trying to get information to help the American people under our First Amendment to be fully informed about the operations of our government, there are people in the journalistic community who will lean on IC resources to say, we want to know all that you’re able to tell us. And the burden of    the burden is on the intelligence official not to leak classified information. The burden is not on the journalists to not ask hard questions. CLAPPER: That is correct, that’s absolutely correct. SASSE: And so it’s useful for the American people to hear you explain, why is Assange something other than just an American journalist asking hard questions? CLAPPER: Well, I think and there’s    there’s obviously judgment, here. And when a journalist does    does harm to the country, harms our national security, compromises sensitive sources and methods and trade craft and puts the company    the    the country    deliberately puts the country in jeopardy, I think that    that’s    the line is    is    that’s a red line, to use a    use a phrase, that I think is    is unacceptable. SASSE: Have any unauthorized disclosures from Assange and WikiLeaks directly endangered Americans and American interests? CLAPPER: In the    yes, absolutely. SASSE: Thank you. Ms. Yates, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. But I’m almost at my time, so I’ll    I’ll limit it to one. Could you please explain the bureaucratic process in which concerning information about political appointees would be brought to the attention of the attorney general? Just give us a few steps in how that process would happen. YATES: When you say concerning information, what do you mean? If (ph). .. SASSE: I’m trying to elicit an answer from that you doesn’t require you to say that, related to Flynn particularly, you can’t disclose how this happened. I think it would be useful for the public to understand, more generally, how information about a political appointee would be brought to the attorney general from the FBI and other. .. YATES: I understand. SASSE: . .. aspects of the intelligence community. YATES: Generally, if we discovered information    let’s say an investigative agency like FBI discovered information about a political appointee, they would first get in contact with the relevant division of the Department of Justice that would have jurisdiction over it, whether it’s the criminal division, the national security division    whatever it might be. They would report that information there, and then, depending on the seriousness of that information, it would probably make its way to me, when I was deputy attorney general, or, then, acting attorney general. SASSE: Thank you. GRAHAM: ( ) COONS: Thank you, Senator Graham. I want to thank both of you for your decades of dedicated service in intelligence and law enforcement, and for your testimony here today. The question before us is one of really grave consequence, as you suggested in your opening statements. Really an existential threat to our democracy, which, if not faced appropriately, will simply encourage increased aggressive actions. The reality is that a foreign adversary intentionally influenced our 2016 presidential election, and our president may not want to confront this, but it is a reality, and one that our U. S. intelligence community agreed about with very high confidence. I greatly appreciate Senators Graham and Whitehouse in convening this hearing, and in treating this very real threat to our democracy with the seriousness that it deserves. Former Director Clapper, in your opening statement, you suggested that the Russians should be celebrating, and that they are likely emboldened, because they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams and at minimal cost, and they are likely to continue. In the French national elections, which concluded yesterday, there was a    a stunning dump of hacked   at the last moment in an attempt    I, at least, believe    to influence the outcome of that election in a way designed to help advance a candidate favored by the Kremlin. And in that instance, there was a significant amount of fake news, of manufactured articles, mixed in with, seemingly, actual   mails that had been hacked, and there are allegations that there was coordination between   news sites trying to forward this information and to get it out around France and around the world. Is that your understanding of what’s just happened in France? And, more importantly, was there any evidence that you saw of comparable coordination between   news sites and released information in the attempts to influence the 2016 American presidential election? CLAPPER: Senator Coons, I    I honestly    all I know is what I’m reading in the media, and so I    I don’t have access to any intelligence information that would help me cast any light    could authoritatively answer your question. All I know is    is what’s    what’s in the media. COONS: But, during the period when you did have regular access to intelligence, did you see any evidence to suggest that the longstanding Russian practice of spreading misinformation and fake news was being amplified by news sites in the United States, and any reason to believe that might have been coordinated or intentional? CLAPPER: Well, I don’t know about the latter. But I    and I think some news outlets were    were probably unwitting of that. It certainly went on. But I can’t say to what extent that was coordinated intentionally with    with certain news outlets. COONS: And you. .. CLAPPER: Again, that’s a    kind of in the domestic realm. COONS: . .. you said that the Russians will continue this behavior until we impose some significant costs. Could you speak briefly to what sort of actions you think we might take that would deter them. .. (CROSSTALK) COONS: . .. this action (ph)? CLAPPER: . .. that’s a little over my labor grade as an intelligence guy. I thought the sanctions that we did impose on the    on the    as    and I was part of that, as part of the former    the former administration    were a great first step. And (inaudible). COONS: Well, I’ll simply say that I agree with you, and a bipartisan bill led by my colleague, Senator Graham, and   by 20 senators, Republican and Democrat, would be a terrific next step. Ms. Yates, we established, in the course of these questions, that, on December 27th and 29th, former national security adviser General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. So when the Trump transition team told the Washington Post on January 13th that sanctions were not discussed, was that false? YATES: I understand that there have been news reports to that account. But I can’t confirm whether in fact those conversations regarding sanctions occurred, because that would require me to reveal classified information. COONS: Understood. So I have a whole series of questions about things that would have been untrue were that the case. You’re not going to be able to answer any of those. YATES: Not to the extent that it goes to General Flynn’s underlying conduct. I can’t address that. COONS: Well, then let me move to that, if I might. YATES: Sure. COONS: On January 24th, you just testified that National Security Adviser Flynn was interviewed by the FBI about his underlying conduct, and that that underlying conduct was problematic because it led to the conclusion the vice president was relying on falsehoods. What was that underlying conduct? And are you convinced that the former national security adviser was truthful in his testimony to the FBI on January 24? YATES: Again, I    I hate to frustrate you again, but I think I’m going to have to, because my knowledge of his underlying conduct is based on classified information. And so I can’t reveal what that underlying conduct is. That’s why I had to do sort of an artificial description, here, of events, without revealing that conduct. COONS: I understand that. On January 27th you just testified that you discussed with White    White House Counsel McGahn four different topics, and one of them included the possibility of criminal prosecution of the former national security adviser, and what would the applicable statutes be. What applicable statutes did you discuss, and in your conclusion, should the national security adviser face criminal prosecution? YATES: Senator Coons, I’m going to strike out here, because, if I identified the statute, then that would be insight into what the conduct was. And, look, I’m not trying to be   here. I’m trying to be really careful that I observe my responsibilities to protect classified information. And so I    I can’t identify the statute. COONS: OK. Do you believe the administration took your warnings seriously when you made this extraordinary effort to go to the White House and, in person, brief the White House counsel on the 26th and 27th? Do you think they took appropriate steps with regards to General Flynn as the national security adviser, given that he remained a frequent participant in very high level national security matters for two weeks? YATES: Well, certainly, in the course of the meetings, both on the 26th and 27th, Mr. McGahn certainly demonstrated that he understood that this was serious. So he did seem to be taking it seriously. I    you know, I don’t have any way of knowing what, if anything, they did. If nothing was done, then certainly, that would be concerning. COONS: So you don’t know whether they took any steps to restrict his access to classified information, to investigate him further, up and until the    the Washington Post published information that made it clear that he had been lying to the vice president? YATES: No, again, I was gone after the 30th. And so it’s    I wouldn’t know if    if any steps had been communicated to the Department of Justice, but I was not aware of any, no. COONS: Had you not been summarily fired, would you have recommended to the White House counsel that they begin further investigations into the national security adviser, or that they restrict his access to sensitive and classified information? YATES: Well, it’s    it’s a bit of a hypothetical. Had I remained at the Department of Justice, and if I were under the impression that nothing had been done, then, yes, I would have raised it again with the White House. COONS: Thank you. Ms. Yates. Thank you, Mr. Graham (ph). GRAHAM: ( ) KENNEDY: Ms. Yates, Dr. Clapper, thank you both for your years of service to the American people. Ms. Yates, I want to start with you. You declined to support    to defend President Trump’s executive order because you thought it was unconstitutional. Is that correct? YATES: That’s correct. Yes. KENNEDY: And you believe there was no    you believe that no reasonable argument could be made in its defense, is that correct? YATES: I don’t know that I would put it in that    in that way, Senator. I    this was the analysis that we went through. KENNEDY: Let me    let me    let me stop you, because I’ve got a whole bunch of questions. YATES: Okay. KENNEDY: I just want to understand your thinking from my perspective. YATES: Sure. KENNEDY: Did you believe, then, that there were reasonable arguments that could be made in its defense? YATES: I believed that any argument that we would have to make in its defense would not be grounded in the truth, because, to make an argument in its defense, we would have to argue that the executive order had nothing to do with religion, that it was not done with an intent to discriminate against Muslims. And based on a variety of factors. .. KENNEDY: And you were looking at intent? YATES: Yes, and I believe that that’s the appropriate analysis. And in fact, that’s been borne out in several court decisions since that time, that that’s the appropriate analysis when you’re doing a constitutional analysis is to look to see what are you trying to accomplish here? KENNEDY: OK. Suppose instead of an executive order, this had been an act of Congress. Would you have refused to defend it? YATES: If it were the same act, yes. And in fact, the Department of Justice has done that in the past. For example, with DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, when the Department of Justice refused to defend DOMA. KENNEDY: But that was a political decision, was it not? YATES: Well, I wasn’t at main justice at that time, so I can’t speak to that. But that was another example of when DOJ did not defend the constitutionality of a statute in that sense. KENNEDY: OK. But in your opinion, the executive order is unconstitutional. YATES: I certainly was not convinced that it was constitutional, and given that I wasn’t in the import of this, I couldn’t in good conscience send Department of Justice lawyers in to defend it. KENNEDY: Well, I want to be sure I understand. Do you believe it’s constitutional or unconstitutional? YATES: I believed    I was not convinced that it was constitutional. I believed that it was unconstitutional in the sense that there was no way in the world I could send folks in there to argue something that we didn’t believe to be the truth. KENNEDY: So you believe it’s unconstitutional? YATES: Yes. KENNEDY: OK. I don’t mean to wax two (ph). .. YATES: And if I can say, I can understand why might be a little frustrated with the language here. .. KENNEDY: I’m not frustrated. I’m happy as a clown. YATES: And here’s   here’s the reason. Let me give you a little idea of the timing of this. KENNEDY: Let me stop you because I don’t have much time. I’ve got a lot of ground to cover. YATES: OK. KENNEDY: I don’t mean to wax too (ph) metaphysical here, but at what point does an act of Congress or an executive order become unconstitutional? YATES: Well, it all depends on what the act does. KENNEDY: No, but I mean, at what point    is it become    I can look at a statute and say I think that’s unconstitutional. Does that make it unconstitutional? YATES: I think the issue that we faced at the Department of Justice is to defend this executive order would require lawyers to go in and argue that this has nothing to do with religion, something that. .. KENNEDY: But at what point does a statute or an executive order become unconstitutional? Is it some apriori (ph) determination? It become    let me   telling you what you I’m getting at and I don’t mean you any disrespect. Who appointed you to the United States Supreme Court? YATES: I was appointed. .. KENNEDY: That determined    isn’t it a court of (ph) final jurisdiction decides what’s constitutional and not? In fact, aren’t most acts of Congress presumed to be constitutional? YATES: They are presumed but they’re not always constitutional, and of course, I was not on the Supreme Court. And I can tell you, Senator, look, we really wrestled over this decision. I personally wrestled over this decision and it was not one that I took lightly at all. But it was because I took my responsibilities seriously. .. (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY: I believe you believe what you’re saying. YATES: Yes, I do. KENNEDY: I just find it   understand, this is likely to come up in the future. YATES: Well. .. KENNEDY: At what point does an executive order or statute become unconstitutional? When I think it’s unconstitutional or you think it’s unconstitutional or a court of final jurisdiction says it’s unconstitutional? YATES: I believe that it is the responsibility of the attorney general if the president asks him or her to do something that he or she believes is unlawful or unconstitutional to say no, and that’s what I did. KENNEDY: OK, I get it. All right. Let me ask you both a couple questions. Can we agree, Director and Counselor, that the Russians attempted to influence the outcome of the election? CLAPPER: Yes, sir, absolutely. YATES: Yes. KENNEDY: Do you believe that the Russians did in fact influence the outcome of the election? Director? CLAPPTER: In our intelligence community assessment, we made the point that we could not make that call. The intelligence community has neither the authority, the expertise or the resources to make that judgment. The only thing we said was we saw no evidence of influencing voter tallies at any of the 50 states. But we were not in a position to judge whether    what actual outcome on the election. KENNEDY: How about you, Ms. Yates? YATES: I don’t know the answer to that and I think that’s part of the problem, is we’ll never know. KENNEDY: OK. Have you ever    the Russians have been doing this for years, have they not? I’m not minimizing what they did. I think they did try to influence the election. CLAPPER: It’s absolutely true. As I pointed    as I mentioned in my opening statement, sir, the    they’ve been doing this since at least the ’60s. KENNEDY: OK. CLAPPER: The difference, however, was this is unprecedented in terms of its aggressiveness and the multifaceted campaign that they mounted. That’s new. KENNEDY: Isn’t it a fact that in 1968, the Kremlin    actually Service A, which was part of the AGB (ph) attempted to subsidize the campaign of Hubert Humphrey? CLAPPER: I don’t know the specifics of that. I’d want to research that, but again, that certainly comports with what Russian tactics would be. KENNEDY: OK. Isn’t it a fact that in 1984, the Kremlin tried to stop Ronald Reagan from being  ? CLAPPER: Again, I’d have to do some research to verify that. But again, it certainly comports with what, if they chose a candidate for whatever reason they had an aversion to, they would do that. KENNEDY: OK. General Clapper, have you ever leaked information, classified or unclassified, to a member of the press? CLAPPER: Not wittingly or knowingly, as I said in my statement. KENNEDY: Classified or unclassified? CLAPPER: Well, unclassified is not leaking. (LAUGHTER) Unclassified    that’s    that’s somewhat of a (inaudible). KENNEDY: And have you ever given information to a reporter that you didn’t want to have your name connected with, but you wanted to see it in the paper? CLAPPER: I have not. I’ve had many encounters with media over my career. KENNEDY: I’m sorry about that. (LAUGHTER) How you about, Ms. Yates? YATES: Other than situations where the Department of Justice would arrange, for example, for me to talk on background with reporters about a particular issue to educate them about that, no. I certainly never provided classified information and that would be the only kind of background information. .. (CROSSTALK) KENNEDY: Do you know. .. CLAPPER: I might have done the same thing, but certainly not    that doesn’t include sharing classified information. KENNEDY: Do you know anybody else at Justice who has ever leaked classified or unclassified information to the press? YATES: No. KENNEDY: Ms. Yates? YATES: No. KENNEDY: OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I went over. I apologize. (CROSSTALK) GRAHAM: Senator Leahy? LEAHY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Clapper, Ms. Yates, good to see you again. Good to have you back here. I    Ms. Yates, I remember so well your confirmation hearing. I remember one senator just bearing in on you, intensely bearing in on you saying, ”Would stand up to the president of the United States if you thought he was asking you to do something unlawful? He’s demanding under oath for you to say yes, you would stand up?” And you told then Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama that’s what you would do and appears to me that you kept your word. Apparently, it’s OK to keep your word depending upon who the administration is. But I’m proud of you for keeping your word when the president tried to set a religious test for entrance into this country, something (inaudible) it was unconstitutional. You said you aren’t going to uphold it. I wish that Mr. Sessions and others had kept as consistent in this administration as they did in the last. That’s my editorial judgments. Now, you wrote to the Justice Department, ”I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution’s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I’m not convinced that the (inaudible) executive order’s consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced the executive order is lawful.” Is that an accurate statement of what you said? YATES: Yes, it is, Senator. LEAHY: And do you still feel that way today? YATES: Yes, I do. LEAHY: The White House claimed that you betrayed the Department of Justice? Do you feel you betrayed the Department of Justice? YATES: No, Senator, I feel to have done anything else would have been a betrayal of my solemn obligation to represent the people and to uphold the law and the Constitution. LEAHY: Was the White House trying to tell the Justice Department how to carry out that executive order? YATES: Well, I didn’t have a lot of discussion with the White House about this executive order. They    I’m sorry. I don’t entirely understand the question. LEAHY: No, but I mean, did anybody from the White House try to direct the Justice Department how they should respond on that executive order? YATES: Well, certainly there was discussion with the White House about litigation strategy, but that occurred, to my knowledge, over the weekend. But, after the 30th, when I issued my directive, I was gone then that evening around 9:00, so I don’t know what other discussions occurred after that. LEAHY: Well, one, I applaud you for keeping your word to then Senator Sessions, who apparently has a different standard as Attorney General. FBI Director Comey testified before this committee, he has told why he appointed a special counsel to investigate the law plainly, back in 2003, he was Deputy Attorney General, Attorney General Ashcroft has refused, himself. Some of the senior officials and Trump campaign administration are connected to this Russian investigation, and Attorney General was forced to recuse himself. I do think this is the kind of situation where we should do what, then Deputy Attorney General Comey as acting Attorney General did in the flame (ph) investigation, and appoint a special counsel. YATES: Well, Senator, I think that my successor, Rod Rosenstein has a big job ahead of him. And, I don’t think I’m going to be giving him any advice from the cheap seats about how he needs to do it. LEAHY: Well, let me ask you this, we know about General Putin’s vulnerability to Russian blackmail, Attorney General Sessions misled this committee about his contacts, and then he had to change his testimony. The President’s    and senior adviser, also reported he failed to disclose contacts on his security clearance forms. Do you have or did you have, or did you have, any concerns about the Attorney General, about Mr. Kushner or other trump officials, vulnerability to blackmail? YATES: All this information came to light after I was no longer with DOJ. LEAHY: Did you have concerns, though, while you were at DOJ, that General Flynn might be vulnerable to blackmail? YATES: Yes, I did, and expressed those to the White House. LEAHY: You say why you feel he may have been vulnerable to blackmail, and if somebody else fell into that same category, might they be vulnerable to blackmail? YATES: Well, certainly any time the Russians have compromising information on you, then you are certainly vulnerable to blackmail. LEAHY: Let me ask General Clapper this. You’ve looked at a lot of these, the other cases of the senior government officials. If they have hidden financial information, things that normally disclose when you take a senior official position, is that an area where they could be blackmailed, if it’s discovered? CLAPPER: Yes, it is, of course. LEAHY: And, is it your experience that Russians search for that kind of thing? CLAPPER: Absolutely, they do. LEAHY: January, the intelligence community, the FBI, CIA, NSA, concluded high conference (ph) that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, to denigrate Secretary Clinton, help elect Donald Trump. Last week, President Trump contradicted that consensus, he said while it could have been China, it could have been a lot of different groups. Do you feel Russia was responsible? CLAPPER: Absolutely. And regrettably, certainly he, although the conclusions that we rendered were the same as in the highly classified report, as the unclassified, unfortunately a lot of the substantiation for that could not be put in the unclassified report because of the sensitivity of it. To me, the evidence was overwhelming, and very compelling, that the Russians did this. LEAHY: Does it serve any purpose for high officials, like the President, to say, ”Well it could have been somebody else, it could have been china”? I mean does that really, does that help us, or does that help Russia? CLAPPER: Well, yes, I guess it could be    you could rationalize that it helps the Russians by obfuscating who was actually responsible. LEAHY: Thank you, thank you very much, General. Thank you, Miss Yates. It’s good to have you, both, here. GRAHAM: Senator Franken. FRANKEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank both you and the ranking member for    for this hearing and these hearings. And I want to thank General Clapper and    and Attorney General Yates for    for appearing today. We have    the intelligence communities have concluded all 17 of them that Russia interfered with this election. And we all know how that’s right. CLAPPER: Senator, as I pointed out in my statement Senator Franken, it was there were only three agencies that directly involved in this assessment plus my office. .. FRANKEN: But all 17 signed on to that? CLAPPER: Well, we didn’t go through that    that process, this was a special situation because of the time limits and my    what I knew to be to who could really contribute to this and the sensitivity of the situation, we decided it was a constant judgment (ph) to restrict it to those three. I’m not aware of anyone who dissented or    or disagreed when it came out. FRANKEN: OK. And I think anyone whose looked at even the unclassified border’s pretty convinced that this is what happened. And one of the questions is, why do they favor Donald Trump? There are a number of contacts and communications that between Trump campaign officials and associates and members of the Trump administration, Jeff Sessions as Senator Leahy mentioned. Carter Page, a former campaign advisor, Paul Manafort who was a former campaign manager and chief strategist, Rex Tillerson, secretary of state, friend of Russia war (ph) Roger Stone, and of course, Jared Kushner, White House senior advisor, Simon Law (ph) and Michael Flynn. All    that’s a lot, in    in my mind. Now, going to Flynn, he appeared during the campaign on Russia Today. Russia Today is the propaganda arm, one of the propagandas arms. And now you, General, since you’ve retired have you appeared on Russia today? (LAUGHTER) CLAPPER: No, no, not willingly, you know. FRANKEN: OK. And    and General Flynn received $37, 000 for sitting next to Putin at the 10th anniversary of Russia today. It seems    all this seems very odd to me and raised a lot of questions. I was struck that Mr. McGahn did not ask you in the second meeting why DOJ, General Yates, would have concerns that the    that the national security advisor had lied to the vice president. In the first meeting, did you mention that? That that was    that he might be compromised? YATES: Certainly, we went through all of our concerns in the first meeting. And it was in the second meeting that he just raised the question of essentially, why is this an issue for the Department of Justice if one White House official lies to another. FRANKEN: OK I don’t understand why he didn’t understand that. YATES: I’m not sure I can help you with that, Senator. FRANKEN: This is    General Flynn after that, for 18 days stayed there and was in one classified thing after another. There are policies that deal with who gets clearance, security clearance and not. The executive order 12968 outlines the rules for security clearances and says that when there is a credible allegation that raises concern about someone’s fitness to access classified information, that person’s clearance should be suspended, pending investigations, is that right? The executive order also states that clearance holders must always demonstrate, quote, ”trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion and sound judgment, as well as freedom from allegiances and potential for coercion.” Is that right? And yet, the White House Council did not understand why the Department of Justice was concerned. YATES: Well, to be fair to Mr. McGahn, I think the issue that he raised, he wasn’t clear on was why we cared that Michael Flynn had lied to the vice president and others, why that was a matter of . .. (CROSSTALK) FRANKEN: I think that’s clear. YATES: Within DOJ jurisdiction. FRANKEN: I think that’s so clear, I can’t. .. YATES: Yes. FRANKEN: And the president had told    President Obama had told the incoming   two days after the election, don’t hire this guy. YATES: I don’t know anything about that. FRANKEN: Well, that’s what we’ve heard. (LAUGHTER) FRANKEN: And we have McGahn doesn’t understand what’s wrong with this? And then we have Spicer, the press secretary, saying the president was told about this. The president was told about this in late January, according to the press secretary. So now he’s got a guy who has been, the former president said, don’t hire this guy. He’s clearly compromised. He’s lied to the vice president. And he keeps him on, and he lets him be in all these classified phone    lets him talk with Putin. President of the United States and the national security adviser sit in the oval office and discuss this with Putin. Is it possible that the reason that he didn’t fire him then was that, well, if I fire him for talking to the Russians about sanctions, and if I fire    what about all the other people on my team, who coordinated? I mean, isn’t it possible that the reason    because you ask yourself, why wouldn’t you fire a guy who did this? And all I can think of is that he would say, well, we’ve got all these other people in the administration who have had contacts. We have all these other people in the administration who coordinated, who are talking. Maybe that. I’m just trying to    we’re trying to put a puzzle together here, everybody. And maybe, just maybe, he didn’t get rid of a guy who lied to the vice president, who got paid by the Russians, who went on Russia Today, because there are other people in his administration who met secretly with the Russians and didn’t reveal it until later, until they were caught. That may be why it took him 18 days, until it became public, to get rid of Mike Flynn, who is a danger to this republic. Care to comment? (LAUGHTER) YATES: I don’t think I’m going to touch that, senator. Thank you. GRAHAM: Senator Blumenthal. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank you, Senator Graham, and Senator Whitehouse for conducting this hearing in a bipartisan way and for prioritizing this issue, which is of such gravity to our Democracy. I want to thank each of you not only for your long and distinguished service, but also for the conscience and conviction that you have brought to your jobs. Whether we agree or disagree with you. I hope that there are young prosecutors around the country and young members of our intelligence committee who will watch this hearing and say, that’s the kind of professional I want to be. Not just expert, but people of deep conviction and conscience. And I agree with my colleagues that there ought to be an independent commission that can have public hearings, produce recommendations and a report. But I also believe that there has to be a special prosecutor. Because what I hear from people in Connecticut and from my colleagues in their town halls and meetings is that people want the truth uncovered about how the Russians sought to interfere and undermine our democracy and electoral system. And they also want accountability. They want not only the Russians to pay a price, they want anybody who colluded with the Russians or aided and abetted them to pay a price as well. And there are criminal statutes that prohibit that kind of collusion, and impose serious criminal fines and imprisonment for people who might have done that. And we know that the FBI is now investigating the potential collusion of Trump associates and Trump campaign and administration officials with the Russians, as Director Comey has told us and made public. So, there’s no classified information there. The meeting that the FBI conducted on January 24th preceded by one day, approximately, your first meeting with Donald McGahn. Isn’t it a fact that Michael Flynn lied to the FBI? YATES: And I can’t reveal the internal FBI investigation, Senator, even though it’s not    even though part would not be technically classified, it’s on ongoing investigation and I can’t reveal that. BLUMENTHAL: Did you tell Donald McGahn that   Security Adviser Flynn told the truth to the FBI? YATES: No, he asked me how he had done in the interview, and I specifically declined to answer that. BLUMENTHAL: Because it was part of an investigation? YATES: That’s right. BLUMENTHAL: Was that intended to indicate to him that Michael Flynn had a problem in that interview? YATES: No, I was intending to let him know that Michael Flynn had a problem on a lot of levels, but it wasn’t necessarily with respect to how he performed in the interview. I was intentionally not letting him know how the interview had gone. BLUMENTHAL: And lying to the FBI is a crime, correct? YATES: It is, yes. BLUMENTHAL: Violation of 18 United States Code 1001? YATES: That’s right. BLUMENTHAL: And it’s punishable by five years in prison? YATES: Yes, it is. BLUMENTHAL: So, if Michael Flynn lied to the FBI, he had a ton of legal trouble facing him? YATES: He could face criminal prosecution if he lied to the FBI, yes. BLUMENTHAL: And if he became a foreign agent for another country, for Turkey, which he was a foreign agent for, without getting permission from the Department of Defense, he faced criminal penalties for that and still faces them, correct? YATES: Yes. It’s certainly FARA violations can be criminally prosecuted, yes. BLUMENTHAL: In fact, it’s a violation of 18 United States Code 219, and that’s punishable by two years in prison, correct? YATES:  . BLUMENTHAL: And his failure to disclose payments from foreign sources which also he had done before you went to Donald McGahn is also criminally punishable, is it not? YATES: That was not a topic I discussed with Mr. McGahn and so it’s not something I can discuss here today. BLUMENTHAL: But it is in fact, from your knowledge a violation of criminal law, is it not? YATES: To not disclose payments for it, yes, but I’m not speaking to his specific conduct, just generally that it is, yes. BLUMENTHAL: If Michael Flynn is prosecuted for any of these crimes, isn’t it possible that the vice president of the United States might be a witness? YATES: I guess it would depend on the crime. BLUMENTHAL: If it were a false statement to the FBI about his conversations with the Russians, wouldn’t the vice president potentially be called as a witness to corroborate that false statement? YATES: You know, I would be    certainly that’s possible, but I would be speculating how such criminal prosecution would come together. BLUMENTHAL: So where I’m going is, the need for a special prosecutor is because officials at the highest level who are responsible for appointing the deputy attorney general, the United States attorney general are all potentially witnesses and they are even targets, correct? YATES: Potentially. BLUMENTHAL: And so a special counsel, in order to hold those government officials or others responsible, really has to be independent, correct? YATES: Well, Department of Justice lawyers pride themselves on being able to be independent regardless of whether they’re appointed as a special counsel. BLUMENTHAL: But the ultimate decision whether or not to prosecute, for the sake of appearance as well as in reality, should be made by someone who is unquestionably independent, objective, and impartial? YATES: Senator, I absolutely understand your concerns here. But the fact of the matter is, is that particularly as someone who just departed from the Department of Justice, I’m just not going to wade into whether or not they should have a special counsel or an independent counsel in this matter. I don’t really think they need the formers telling them how to do their jobs. BLUMENTHAL: Well, I’m going to be very unfair to you and just ask you, as a private citizen, wouldn’t you like to see a special counsel appointed under these circumstances? (LAUGHTER) YATES: Not going to go there either, Senator. BLUMENTHAL: As an expert witness. .. (LAUGHTER) . .. for our committee, I’ll qualify you as an expert if Judge Graham allows me to do it. Let me. .. GRAHAM: You’ll have to pay her. (LAUGHTER) BLUMENTHAL: Let me just close by asking you, my colleague, Senator Franken, made reference to warnings given to the    given by President Obama to    Trump about hiring Michael Flynn. That is a public report from The New York Times, in fact, of today, which I ask to be entered into the record. And I also ask to be entered into the record, the February 9th report from The Washington Post, I believe there has been a reference to it. Without that published report, and without the free press telling us a lot of what went on, Michael Flynn might still be sitting in the White House as national security adviser, because by January 30th, you were forced to resign, correct? You were fired. YATES: Yes, I was fired. BLUMENTHAL: So nobody was around to tell the White House, as you said, that our national security was in danger. YATES: Well, there were still the career officials in the National Security Division who had been working with me on this matter that were there and were certainly conversant in the facts. BLUMENTHAL: But the ultimate decision to go to the White House was yours? YATES: Yes, it was. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. GRAHAM: Senator Hirono. HIRONO: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In spite of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to convince all of us that there is nothing to see here with regard to Russian interference with our 2016 election, the Trump team’s connections to these efforts, we need to get to the bottom of this. And so I thank Chair Graham and Ranking Member Whitehouse for these hearings. And in fact I just had a number of town hall meetings in Hawaii this past weekend. And hundreds of people came, and believe me, they care that we get to the bottom of this. The Trump administration blames President Obama for failing to suspend General Flynn’s clearance. And in fact in a press conference today, Sean Spicer said: ”Everyone in the government goes through the same process.” And he also said: ”There’s no difference of a security clearance once it’s issued. And basically as far as this administration is concerned, nothing more needed to be done” by them regarding General Flynn’s clearance. Director Clapper, isn’t it true that the CIA has a separate vetting process for National Security Council appointees? And in fact the press is reporting today that General Flynn never completed that process. Can you enlighten us? CLAPPER: I can’t speak to specifics of how it was done with General Flynn. I know what I went through as a political appointee twice in two    in a Republican and a Democratic administration. And the vetting process for either a political appointee or someone working in the White House is far, far more invasive and far, far more thorough than a standard   clearance process. But I don’t know what process was used in General Flynn’s case. And nor did I have access to his complete investigatory file, so it’s very difficult for me to speculate on what was in it and what action, if any, was taken by the White House. HIRONO: Well, according to Sean Spicer, that he had a clearance from the Obama administration, and that was it. And this administration had no further responsibilities. So let me go on. Others of my colleagues have mentioned, and you yourself, Mr. Clapper, said that RT is a Russian mouthpiece to spread propaganda. And, of course, we know that General Flynn attended a gala hosted by    or a 10th anniversary gala for RT in December, 2015, where he sat next President Putin and got paid over $33, 000 for that. Mr. Clapper, given the conversation that Ms. Yates provided to the White House regarding    and this is during the January 26th and 27th timeframe    regarding General Flynn, should he have sat in on the following discussions? On January 28th, he participated in an   call, along with President Trump, to President Putin. And on February 11th, he participated in a discussion with Prime Minister Abe and the president at    to discuss North Korea’s missile tests. Should he    given the    the information that had already been provided by Ms. Yates, should he have participated in these two very specific instances? CLAPPER: Well, I    you know, I can’t, it’s difficult for me to answer, Because I’m not    I    I was out at that. .. HIRONO: Well, let’s say you were in. CLAPPER: . .. point. I    I don’t    as just a standard comment, a    a general comment, I    I don’t think it    it was a    I don’t think it was a good practice. Put it that way. HIRONO: So I think this comports with some of the concerns that have been raised about the appropriateness or adequacy of the Trump administration’s vetting process with regard to various disclosures by other members of his administration, and, as I mentioned, the administration’s continuing efforts to downplay Russia’s interference in our elections. After General Flynn resigned on February 13th, on February 15th, President Trump tweeted that Flynn is a, quote, ”wonderful man,” and, quote, ”it’s very, very unfair what’s happened to General Flynn,” unquote. So, Mr. Clapper, is this the kind of statement that would be made by a president aware of serious security concerns about his former national security adviser? CLAPPER: Well, I    I’m loath to comment on the tweets. I    you know, that’s    that was, I    I suppose, an honest expression of how he felt. HIRONO: Well, does this sound like somebody who knew that there were serious security concerns about it, that he would say it was very, very unfair, and that    that Mr. Flynn is a wonderful man? Maybe I should just. .. (CROSSTALK) CLAPPER: Well, I don’t. .. HIRONO: . .. and people can draw their own conclusions. CLAPPER: . .. I    I don’t know what information was conveyed to the president. I    I have no insight there. So I don’t know to    the extent to which he had an understanding of what the former attorney    acting attorney general. .. HIRONO: Yes. CLAPPER: . .. conveyed. I don’t know how much of that made its way to the president. HIRONO: Yes, precisely that    that is a concern that I would have, that it sounds like perhaps the president was not aware. And in fact, going on, in March, the president tweeted that Flynn should be given immunity    Flynn resigned on February 13    and that the FBI’s investigation is, quote, ”a witch hunt.” So, I’d like to ask both of you, should these tweets    these kinds of tweets and other similar assertions by the president have any influence at all on the FBI’s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our elections and team Trump’s connections to these efforts? CLAPPER: Well, it shouldn’t, and I’m confident it won’t. HIRONO: I hope so. I have a question about the Foreign Agents Registration Act violations    FARA. A number of Trump administration officials are belatedly disclosing and registering their work on behalf of foreign governments under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, some of which raised serious   concerns. I asked Director Comey about these concerns last week. Ms. Yates, what are the consequences for White House staffers who fail to disclose their foreign contacts on their security clearance forms? YATES: Well, there can be a variety of ramifications. You can lose your security clearance. You can lose your job, or, in certain circumstances, you can be criminally prosecuted. HIRONO: Is it up to the Department of Justice or the FBI to pursue these kinds of allegations against staffers who do not disclose appropriately? YATES: Again, it would all depend on the circumstances of the   whether it was willful, and what the circumstances were of the conduct underlying that. So it would really    it’s going to be very  . HIRONO: I agree that it should be   but considering the allegations, though, I    I hope that either the FBI or the Department of Justice is pursuing an investigation into these matters. Again, under what circumstances would the Department of Justice decide to bring charges against someone for violating FARA? So you    you said, Ms. Yates, it would depend on the facts. .. YATES: Right (ph). HIRONO: . .. of the    of the situation. If the president or someone close to him knew that a White House official failed to disclose work on behalf of a foreign government, and chose to cover that up. Again, can you reiterate again the possible repercussions to this person? YATES: To the individual? HIRONO: To the individual. Let’s say that the allegations are proven true. YATES: That they fail to disclose their activity and that the President covered it up, or the individual did? HIRONO: Let’s say the person knew or the administration knew and then the individual also covered it up? YATES: Well cover ups are bad. They (inaudible) usually as evidence of intent and so that’s something that we look at in making determinations about whether it’s something that should be criminally prosecuted. But again, you know it’s going to be very fact specific. It’s hard to give you a hard fast answer. HIRONO: And if the administration    either knew or should have known   ’m sorry. GRAHAM: Senator. HIRONO: Thank you very much, you’ve been very . .. GRAHAM: We’re going to do a second round, but we’re going to do it quickly and we’re going to do four minute rounds and there’s light at the end of the tunnel. We got a vote at 5:30, so I promise you you’re going to get out of here pretty quick. But I know Senators have questions, starting with me and I’m going to enforce the four minutes to myself. General Clapper, during your investigation of all things Russia, did you ever find a situation where a trump business interest in Russia gave you concern? CLAPPER: Not in the course of the preparation of the intelligence communities assessment. GRAHAM: Since? CLAPPER: I’m sorry? GRAHAM: At all, any time? CLAPPER: Senator Graham I can’t comment on that because that impacts an investigation. GRAHAM: It wasn’t enough to put into the report. CLAPPER: That’s correct. GRAHAM: OK. Ms. Yates the rule of law, you cannot allow people to leak classified information because they want a particular outcome, that’s not the rule of law, is that correct? CLAPPER: Absolutely. GRAHAM: Then I think you both agree with that concept. Did Mr. McCan( ph) in your view Ms. Yates, ask reasonable questions about your concerns? YATES: I didn’t really have a judgment about whether they were reasonable or unreasonable. But I do think that Mr. McCan (ph) was trying to get to the bottom, in our discussion of what had happened with General . .. GRAHAM: And he wanted to actually see the information that you were talking about? YATES: He indicated he did. Again, I don’t have any way of knowing what happened after that. GRAHAM: But he said he wanted to and you tried to set that up. YATES: That’s right. GRAHAM: OK. Now about surveillance, this is very important, an American citizen cannot be surveilled in the United States for colluding with a foreign government unless you have a warrant. Is that a true statement of the law? YATES: That’s right. GRAHAM: Is it fair to say that incidental collection occurs, even in the united States? YATES: That’s correct as well, yes. GRAHAM: OK. So there’s two situations that we would have found out what General Flynn said to the Russian bastard. If there was a FISA warrant focused on him, was there? YATES: You asking? GRAHAM: Yes, either one of you. YATES: Again I think you know I’m not going to answer whether there was a FISA warrant. Nor am I even going to talk about whether General Flynn was talking to the Russians. GRAHAM: OK. CLAPPER: Oh I have to obviously going to go along with . .. YATES: Well if he wasn’t talking to the Russians, we’ve had a hearing for no good reason. So clearly he’s talking to the Russians and we know about it. So if there is no FISA warrant, and I’m going to find out about this by the way. The other way that we knew what he was talking about, the Russia (inaudible) was incidentally surveilled. So those were the two options. Do we know who unmasked the conversation between the Russian ambassador and General Flynn? Was there unmasking in this situation? CLAPPER: Are you looking at me? GRAHAM: Yes sir. CLAPPER: I don’t know. GRAHAM: Do you Ms. Yates? YATES: I can’t speak to this specific situation. But can I try to clarify one point on this unmasking thing? GRAHAM: Very quickly. YATES: OK I’ll try to do it quickly. As a consumer of intelligence I would    for example, I would receive intelligence reports from various agencies. GRAHAM: I get that, no. YATES: Now often times the names are already unmasked by the intelligence agencies . .. GRAHAM: The bottom line here is I want to know how it got to the Washington Post. Somebody had to have access to the information and they gave it to the Washington Post, is that a fair statement? YATES: That’s right. That’s what it looks like to me. GRAHAM: Is that right General Clapper? CLAPPER: Yes. GRAHAM: And it was    neither one of you did it? YATES: That’s right. CLAPPER: That’s right. GRAHAM: How many people can request unmasking of American citizen in our government, General Clapper, how many? CLAPPER: I don’t have an exact number. It’s I think fairly limited, because it’s a    normally fairly high level officials. GRAHAM: How did you know that General Flynn was talking to the Russian’s who told you? YATES: And I can’t reveal that in an open setting. But what I was trying to say was, is that often times we receive intelligence reports where the name of the American citizen is already unmasked, and it’s unmasked by the intel agency because, not based on anybody’s request, but because the name of that citizen is essential. GRAHAM: Is that the situation here? YATES: I can’t    Senator, I cannot. .. (CROSSTALK) GRAHAM: Thank you. My four minutes is up. Thank you both. But I want to know the answer to these questions. Senator Whitehouse? WHITEHOUSE: Thanks, again, Chairman. Two things. One, there are multiple levels of security clearances, and they’re issued by different agencies, correct? So having one from DoD doesn’t necessarily make you good for all positions and places. CLAPPER: It does not. WHITEHOUSE: And in DoD operates clearances at multiple levels, correct? CLAPPER: Right. But I think the key point here is that, as I indicated earlier, the requirements for a   versus the requirements for occupying a sensitive position in the White House as a part of the National Security Council or. .. (CROSSTALK) WHITEHOUSE: Way higher than for a retired general? CLAPPER: Well, exactly. And as I can attest, much more invasive and aggressive than a standard  . WHITEHOUSE: Now in terms of compromise tradecraft, if you have somebody, and you have them compromised, it’s pretty standard compromise tradecraft to ask them to do some little thing for you under the threat of having the compromising information disclosed. And if you succeed, you now have two things on them. And you work it that way to get somebody more and more enmeshed in compromise until they’re more or less owned by the intelligence agency. Is that a fair description of how you can develop compromise through regular tradecraft? CLAPPER: Yes, yes, yes. WHITEHOUSE: OK. Just want to make that sure, because we’re talking a lot about it here. Last thing, my list. So, I went through the list, it looked like propaganda, fake news, trolls, and bots. We can all agree from the IC report that those were in fact used in the 2016 election. Hacking and theft of political information, the hack into the DNC, into the Podesta   I think we can all agree that that’s a yes. Timed leaks of damaging material. That appears very strongly to be a yes, because of the timing of the release, smack after the ”Access Hollywood” release. I believe that the answers were correct, no, as to   assassination and political violence by the Russians here in the United States. Would you both agree with that? CLAPPER: I don’t think we turned up any evidence of that. WHITEHOUSE: OK. And controlling investment in key economic sectors for leverage, it seems that our economy is probably a little too big for that and there was no evidence of that in the IC report either, correct? CLAPPER: That’s correct. WHITEHOUSE: So, the question of shady business and financial ties that not only start out as bribery, perhaps, or as highly favorable deals, secret deals with Russians, but that in turn can then turn into compromise? CLAPPER: It could. WHITEHOUSE: And it’s not just the carrot of I’m continuing to bribe you, at some point you have a stick over the individual of, I’m going to out the deal that we have unless you do this, correct? CLAPPER: That’s classic kompromat. WHITEHOUSE: And we do not yet know the extent to which that has played a role in the 2016 Russian election hack, correct? CLAPPER: I don’t. WHITEHOUSE: And in terms of corrupting and compromising politicians, same, we don’t know the full extent of whether or not politicians have been corrupted and compromised? CLAPPER: I certainly don’t    I did not and don’t. WHITEHOUSE: So, if we were to go down this, yes, yes, yes, no, no, question mark, question mark, would be our tally at the end. Are we agreed on that? CLAPPER: Yes. WHITEHOUSE: OK. Anything else, Ms. Yates? YATES: Not from me, sir. WHITEHOUSE: Terrific. Thank you. I yield back my nine seconds. (LAUGHTER) GRAHAM: You’re a  . Senator Grassley? GRASSLEY: Mr. Clapper, you said yes when I asked you if you ever unmasked a Trump associate or a member of Congress. But I forgot to ask, which was it? Was it a Trump associate, a member of Congress, or both? CLAPPER: Over my time as DNI, I think the answer was on rare occasion, both. And, again, Senator, just to make the point here, my focus was on the foreign target and at the foreign target’s behavior in relation to the U. S. person. GRASSLEY: OK. How many instances were there, or was there just one? CLAPPER: I can only recall one. GRASSLEY: Could you provide. .. CLAPPER: It could have been more. And the best accounting of this would be in accordance with the procedure, the collecting agency, and that would be a better source of records than the top of my head. GRASSLEY: OK. Could you provide us more details in a classified setting? CLAPPER: I could. GRASSLEY: OK. Miss Yates, the same question    you said, I don’t know what you said to answer my question about if you were involved in any unmasking, were you involved? YATES: No, I’ve never asked for anyone to be unmasked. GRASSLEY: OK. Senator Graham, both you and I, and maybe other people, have been said that we need a classified setting to get some answers here. I assume you’re going to pursue that? GRAHAM: Yes, sir. GRASSLEY: OK. Let’s see, I got time for a couple more questions, I believe. Regardless of any disagreements that we have about allegations of collusion, the fact that Russia tried to meddle in our democracy is obviously a front to all Americans. We have to punish Russia, and we have to deter all nations from these shenanigans. Do you two believe that the government’s response, so far, has been enough to deter future attacks of this kind? And if not, what else would you think we should be doing? Miss Yates, would you start out, please? YATES: I think they’re coming back, and we have to do a whole lot more, both to harden our election systems, our state election systems, to ensure that folks out there know when they’re looking at news feeds, that it may not be real news that they’re reading. I think that we have to do more to deter the Russians, and it wouldn’t hurt to prosecute a few folks, but I don’t think we should kid ourselves, that we’ll be able to prosecute our way out of this problem. GRASSLEY: OK, Mr. Clapper. CLAPPER: Well, as much as I love Congressional Hearings, I think there is a useful purpose served. Because I think the most important thing that needs to be done here, is educate the electorate as to what the Russians’ objective is, and the tactics and techniques, and procedures that they’ve employed and will continue to employ, and I predict it will be against all the parties. And so, I think education of the public is the most important thing we can do in this hearing, grudgingly though, I admit it, serves that purpose to the extent that this can be shared openly. GRASSLEY: So, your . . . CLAPPER: I do think as well, there needs to be more done in the way of sanctions to the Russians, or any other government, that attempts to interfere in our election process. GRASSLEY: I’m done. GRAHAM: thank you very much. Senator Klobuchar? KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. And we thank you, both, for being here again. I think Senator Graham asked if you would want to come back, then Director Clapper, and we’re very glad that you’re here. So, when I asked my questions before, I asked about this general fact, if a   national security official is caught on tape, with a foreign official, saying one thing in private, and then says something in public that’s different, and if that’s material for blackmail. And you, both, said that it was. Can you give me an examples, just from your experience, Director Clapper, of when Russians have used, for one of better words, sex, lies, and videotape against people as blackmail? CLAPPER: Well, I don’t have a lot of direct knowledge external to Russia, this is a classical technique going back to Soviet era, that they would use to   compromise political opponents. And of course, you know, the current administration in Russia is even more aggressive than that, where they just blot out people for being opposition. So, there are examples of that, I don’t have them off the top of my head, but I have read, and seen it, particularly during the Soviet era, internal to the Soviet Union, that this was a common practice. KLOBUCHAR: What about our election infrastructure, as we move forward? As you said, one major thing we need to do, is to educate the public. And I’m very concerned, while we have different states, have different election equipment on the ranking on rules, and we’re working on a Bill on this. How important is that to protect the integrity of our election equipment? CLAPPER: It’s quite important and speaking now as a private citizen, not my former capacity, I do think that our election apparatus should be considered critical infrastructure, and should have the protections that are tended to that. A lot of states pushed back when Jeh Johnson, secretary of Homeland Security, engaged with state election officials about having that designation and having the federal government interfere in    in their election process. But as a citizen, I’d be concerned with doing all we can to secure that apparatus part of the    attendant (ph) to the intelligence community assessment that we put out. DHS put out a paper on best practices for    as an advisory on how to secure election apparatuses in    at the state and local level. KLOBUCHAR: Very good. Do you think we’re doing a good enough job now, back to the propaganda issue, in educating our citizens about this? CLAPPER: No, we’re not. And the other thing we don’t do well enough is the counter messaging. KLOBUCHAR: And how would you suggest we could improve that? CLAPPER: I would be for    I have been an advocate for a USIA (ph) on steroids. I felt that way in terms of countering the message from ISIS, who is very sophisticated at conveying messages and proselytizing and recruiting people. Our efforts to counter message are too fragmented in my    in my own opinion. That’s all I’m saying here. I    I would seriously consider the notion of a, as I say, a USIA (ph) on steroids not only for the. .. KLOBUCHAR: What would that mean exactly? CLAPPER: I’m sorry? KLOBUCHAR: Well, someone that we could    we could message or counter message, and our efforts to counter violent extremist ideology, particularly that from ISIS, who are very skilled at this and we    I don’t think we do, as a nation, we do a good enough job. I think counter messaging the Russians, giving them some of their own medicine much more aggressively than we’ve done now. And I would hasten to add that is    should not be tagged onto the intelligence community. It needs to be a separate entity from the intelligence community, something the I. C. would support, but should be separate from that. KLOBUCHAR: Mr. Chair, just one last question. Ms. Yates, you brought a lawyer with you, a career lawyer, to the meeting at the White House. Is that right? YATES: Yes, that’s right. KLOBUCHAR: About when you were giving these warnings about the knowledge you had on General Flynn. Is that normal practice? Why did you do that? YATES: Well, this was a person who was the career lawyer who was supervising this matter and we thought that it was important. First of all, she had been the one who was most intimately familiar with it, but secondly, we knew that my tenure was going to be short and wanted to make sure that there was continuity there and that. .. (CROSSTALK) KLOBUCHAR: You just didn’t know it was going to be that short. YATES: I didn’t. KLOBUCHAR: OK. Thank you. (LAUGHTER) GRAHAM: I think the vote is on, so I hate to change, but let’s do three minutes. KENNEDY: I can be very quick. GRAHAM: Yes, sir. KENNEDY: Mr. Clapper, does Mr. Putin have any assets in the United States? CLAPPER: I don’t know the answer to the question. KENNEDY: Who would know that? CLAPPER: Well, some component in the intelligence community might know it or the FBI, but I don’t know. KENNEDY: Do you know if any of Mr. Putin’s friends might have assets in the United States that are being held for Mr. Putin? CLAPPER: That’s a possibility, yes. KENNEDY: Who would know that? Same person? CLAPPER: I’m sorry? KENNEDY: Who would know that? Same person? CLAPPER: I would guess the FBI. KENNEDY: OK. If the intelligence community and the attorney general knew all this information about Mr. Flynn, how did he get a security clearance? CLAPPER: Knew what about Mr. Flynn? KENNEDY: Well, that he had had a conversation with the Russian ambassador about sanctions. CLAPPER: Well, that was late    that was the 29th of December or so, whenever that    whenever that    as reported in the media when that took place. KENNEDY: January 19th, I think, the president was sworn in, 17th, something like that. How did he get a security clearance? CLAPPER: Well, he was a security clearance    had one for a long time. He’s a career military intelligence officer. I don’t know the specifics of when his    when his fell due. The system is every five years    the current system, every five years, you’re supposed to get a periodic reinvestigation. I don’t know the details of that. It would probably be done by his old agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, but. .. KENNEDY: But don’t you have to get some additional double secret security clearance to serve in the White House? CLAPPER: Well, yes, you do. And as I indicated before. .. KENNEDY: Can i ask you how he got one. .. CLAPPER: . .. the process is done    I don’t know how it’s done in this administration. KENNEDY: OK. CLAPPER: But my own knowledge of how it was done when I served in the Bush administration and again in the Obama administration, there’s an extensive vetting process by the FBI. KENNEDY: OK. Let me stop you because I’ve only got 50 seconds. Ms. Yates, are there any reasonable arguments that can be made in defense of President Trump’s executive order? YATES: I don’t believe that there are reasonable legal arguments that are grounded in truth that can be made in defense of his argument that the travel ban was not intended to have an impact, a religious impact, and to disfavor Muslims. KENNEDY: So you believe that the arguments made by the lawyers who are now defending the executive order are unreasonable? YATES: I believe that the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold the law and to always speak the truth, particularly when it’s about something as fundamental as this executive order was, that deals with religious freedom. But let me say this. I have tremendous respect for the career men and women of the Department of Justice, including the lawyers in the civil division who are handling this. But their obligation was different than mine. They must make an argument if they can make a reasonable legal argument. As acting attorney general, my responsibility was broader than that and I had to look beyond the confines of the face of the E. O. to look at the president’s statements and to look at other factors to determine what was the actual intent here, and that was the basis for my decision. KENNEDY: And for the record, different travel ban. GRAHAM: Yeah, there’s a    the first order was withdrawn. There’s a second one out there. Senator Blumenthal. BLUMENTHAL: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Yates, so far, the concerns you expressed about the constitutionality of these executive orders have been upheld by the courts, correct? YATES: That’s right. BLUMENTHAL: Second, Director Clapper, on the issue of possible use of the far right websites by the Russians, you were asked earlier whether you have any knowledge about that potential cooperation or involvement. Do you have independent knowledge of the use of those far right websites? CLAPPER: I don’t. I don’t have, at least off the top of my head, specific knowledge or insight into that connection. Could have been, I just don’t know that directly. BLUMENTHAL: But you made reference to published reports. You said, I think, you knew about it from what you read about in the newspapers. CLAPPER: Well, that’s a specific reference to what happened in    occurred in France. BLUMENTHAL: Correct. And the same tactics that were used most recently in France were also used or at least reportedly used in this country? CLAPPER: Correct. BLUMENTHAL: And I’d like to put in the record one public report, there are probably others, a McClatchy report of March 20th, which begins with the lead, ”federal investigators are examining whether far right news sites played any role last years in the Russian cyber operation that dramatically widened the reach of news stories, some fictional, that favored Donald Trump’s presidential bid.” It quotes tow people familiar with the inquiry and it goes on to mention, ”Among those sites, Breitbart News and Infowars.” Mr. Chairman, if this report could be entered into the record. GRAHAM: ( ) BLUMENTHAL: Do you have knowledge, Ms. Yates, of that federal investigation? YATES: I don’t, and if I did, I couldn’t tell you about it. BLUMENTHAL: I thought that might be your answer. Finally, you said, Ms. Yates, that we’re not going to prosecute our way out of the Russian continued attack on this country. But putting Americans in prison if they cooperate, collude, aid and abet or otherwise assist in that illegality might send a very strong deterrent message, correct? YATES: I expect that it would, yes. BLUMENTHAL: And there are indeed criminal penalties existing on the books, we don’t need new laws, which involve criminality and potential criminal prosecution for those acts, correct? YATES: Yes, that’s right. BLUMENTHAL: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. GRAHAMN: Thank you all. We’re at the end of the day and you’ve been great. I think the public is better educated, at least I hope, about what Russia did. Seems to be bipartisan consensus that Russia tried to interfere with our election. We have some differences in other places. But just some housekeeping here, you will provide to the committee if you could, Mr. Clapper    I know you’re a private citizen now, but if you could help us to determine the pool of people that can request unmasking, we’d appreciate it some later date. When it comes to (inaudible) collection on 2016 campaigns, I’m a little confused, but I think we found at least one occasion where that did happen. You made a request for unmasking on a Trump associate and maybe a member of Congress? Is that right, Mr. Clapper? CLAPPER: Yes. GRAHAM: OK. Do we know any others off the top of your head of any other candidate on either side of the aisle? CLAPPER: Well, I don’t    there could have been other requests    unmasking requests that I. .. GRAHAM: But there’s a way to find that out. CLAPPER: Yes. GRAHAM: OK, good. CLAPPER: And the best way to do it would be to the original collection agency. .. (CROSSTALK) GRAHAM: Right, to find out who requested what. Finally, the current deputy attorney general, do you know him, Ms. Yates? YATES: ( ) GRAHAM: Do you have confidence in him? YATES: Yes, I do. GRAHAM: Thank you all. WHITEHOUSE: Final comment? GRAHAM: Absolutely. WHITEHOUSE: During the last hearing, we had the author of the Kremlin playbook as one of our witnesses and we had the very   regarded Kenneth Weinstein as one of our witnesses, and they both agreed that the United States is leaving itself vulnerable to this kind of influence if we continue to allow shell corporations to proliferate without a way for law enforcement to figure out who the beneficial owners are. So I mention that because Chairman Grassley and I are working on a piece of legislation to help solve that, but I think it’s very important in this area and I just wanted to flag it and express to Chairman Grassley my appreciation for his bipartisan cooperation on that front, and of course, my appreciation to Chairman Graham for his work to make this hearing a success and so interesting and meaningful. Thank you. GRAHAM: Thank you both. The hearing is adjourned. Transcript provided by ASC Services, on behalf of Bloomberg Finance (Government Division)."
"      The doctor was getting ready. Must look respectable, he told himself. Must be calm. He changed into a dark suit, blue shirt and tie and came down the wooden staircase of the stately Victorian house at Seventh and Pine that had always been occupied by the town’s most prominent citizens. That was him: prominent citizen, town doctor,    father of three, and as far as anyone knew, the first Muslim to ever live in Dawson, a farming town of 1, 400 people in the rural western part of the state. “Does this look okay?” Ayaz Virji asked his wife, Musarrat, 36. In two hours, he was supposed to give his third lecture on Islam, and he was sure it would be his last. A local Lutheran pastor had talked him into giving the first one in Dawson three months before, when people had asked questions such as whether Muslims who kill in the name of the prophet Muhammad are rewarded in death with virgins, which had bothered him a bit. Two months later, he gave a second talk in a neighboring town, which had ended with several men calling him the antichrist. Now a librarian had asked him to speak in Granite Falls, a town half an hour away, and he wasn’t sure at all what might happen. So many of the comforting certainties of his life had fallen away since the presidential election, when the people who had welcomed his family to Dawson had voted for Donald Trump, who had proposed banning Muslims from entering the United States, toyed with the idea of a Muslim registry and said among other things, “Islam hates us. ”  Trump had won Lac qui Parle County, where Dawson was the   town, with nearly 60 percent of the vote. He had won neighboring Yellow Medicine County, where Granite Falls was the county seat, with 64 percent. Nearly all of Minnesota outside the Twin Cities had voted for Trump, a surprising turn in a state known for producing some of the Democratic Party’s most progressive leaders, including the nation’s first Muslim congressman. Now Trump was in the White House, and Dawson’s first Muslim resident was sitting in his living room, strumming his fingers on the arm of a chair. The pastor had called to say two police officers would be there tonight, just in case. The late afternoon sun came in through the windows, beyond which was a lovely town of sprawling cottonwoods, green lawns and so many people the doctor felt he no longer knew or maybe even could trust. The doorbell rang. “Hey there,” Ayaz said, snapping out of his thoughts to greet his neighbor. “Hiya,” said the neighbor, who worked in security. He had heard from his wife about the talk in Granite Falls and, wanting to be helpful, had offered to lend Ayaz his bulletproof vest for the evening, and here it was, in the duffle bag he was slinging through the ornate front door. He set it down on a chair in the doctor’s study and pulled out the vest. Ayaz looked at it. He began taking off his suit jacket and tie to try it on.     Wooden gnome statues surround the “Welcome to Dawson” sign in Dawson, which has proclaimed itself Gnometown. Every year, a statue is awarded to a Dawson resident and created in that person’s image. (Salwan   Washington Post)  This was Dawson six months after the election, which was how Ayaz most often thought of things these days  —   before and after. He remembered his first visit three years before, driving with Musarrat on a narrow highway west into the prairie and passing one little farm town after another  —   Cosmos, Prinsburg, Bunde, and finally seeing the wooden sign, “Welcome to Dawson. ” They arrived on a breezy fall day, and he remembered how it all seemed almost corny, from the park with little gnome figurines, to the wide streets named Oak and Maple, to the formidable Grace Lutheran church at the town center. The whole visit felt like one big welcoming parade. Welcome to our hospital and clinic, where the two other doctors, the nurses and other staff members were lined up to greet them. Welcome to the school, where the principal showed them around. Welcome to the   downtown, where there was a butcher, and a bowling alley, and a diner named Wanda’s, and as they walked along, Musarrat noticed something rare. She didn’t feel people staring at her headscarf. They were saying hello and smiling. Ayaz remembered that it “just felt right. ” Wholesome. He had been wanting to get away from his job working for a huge   chain in Harrisburg, Pa. and find a way to practice what he called “dignified medicine. ” The town seemed to want him, too, a doctor with a medical degree from Georgetown University and an interest in rural health. No one seemed to care that he was Muslim, of Indian descent, born in Kenya and raised in Florida. They just needed a good doctor. So the Virjis decided to move to Dawson. By the winter of 2014, they were settling into the Victorian house on Pine and the life Ayaz imagined for his family. The children  —   Maya, Imran and Faisal, the oldest, who was 12 then  —   enrolled in the public school around the corner. Musarrat set up a spa business down the street. Ayaz often walked to work, where his smiling photo hung on the clinic and hospital walls along with his titles: chief of staff and medical director. He was one of only three doctors practicing in Dawson, and one of a few in the county, and was soon busy with patients and helping to plan a $7 million expansion of the facilities. He and Musarrat made friends  —   Jason, Betty, Duane, Stacey and other Dawsonites who would drop by for kebabs or chicken parmesan. When John and Jill Storlien, the local butchers, found out that Ayaz was driving all the way to Minneapolis to get his halal meat, they offered that perhaps they could manage. Their cows came in facing Mecca anyway, it turned out. Ayaz texted them the prayer to say as they butchered, and so one day in a tiny Midwestern town, two Lutherans spoke their first Islamic verses over the carcass of a cow. In summer, neighbors spread blankets and chairs on the Virjis’ front lawn and watched the annual parade float by. And that was how it was going in Dawson, even through an election season that Ayaz found increasingly disturbing, as Trump kept whipping up crowds by saying that maybe Syrian refugees were part of a secret army, and maybe he’d have to shut down mosques, and maybe Muslims were the one immigrant group that could not become fully American. All of that was in the air, but in a county that Barack Obama had won twice, Ayaz saw only two “ ” yard signs during the whole campaign. He never thought Trump would win, much less in Dawson.     Ayaz Virji reacts as his wife, Musarrat Virji, feeds their daughter, Maya, 9, slices of dates while Pastor Mandy France checks her phone after preparing for the next day’s lecture. (Salwan   Washington Post)  The morning after the election, he was shocked and angry, and when he looked up the local results before he went to work, the feelings only intensified. Not only had Trump won the county, he had won Dawson itself by six percentage points. By the time he got to the hospital, he was pacing up and down the hallways, saying he hoped people realized that they just voted to put his family on a Muslim registry, and how would he be treated around here if he didn’t have “M. D. ” after his name? People tried to reason with him. A colleague told him it’s not that people agreed with everything Trump said, and Ayaz said no, you’re giving them a pass. He told the hospital’s chief executive that he was thinking of resigning, and she told him to take some days to cool off. He and Musarrat talked about what to do. He began investigating a job in Dubai. He spoke to his brother in Florida, an investment adviser, who had received a fax after the election that read, “Get the     out of my country you Muslim pig,” and was moving to Canada. Musarrat kept thinking about the time after Sept. 11 when a man had chased her with a baseball bat, yelling about her headscarf. Nothing like that had happened in Dawson, but the Virjis began feeling differently about the town. They wondered whether the people who had seemed so warm were secretly harboring hateful thoughts or suspicions about them. Musarrat told Ayaz that she noticed more silence from certain friends. Ayaz was stopped on a sidewalk by a woman who said, “Jesus loves you,” and wondered what would happen if he said, “Muhammad loves you. ” Another day, he ran into a patient who told him that a lot of farmers had voted for Trump because of   health insurance premiums, not because of “anything racial,” and please, no one wants you to go. Ayaz wasn’t sure whether to believe that. But he and Musarrat decided to stay, at least for the time being, and he tried to transform his anger into understanding. Maybe people really didn’t know, he told himself. Maybe people were suffering in ways he didn’t understand. Not long after that, a patient of his named Mandy France, a pastor in training at Grace Lutheran, asked if he might be willing to give a talk about Islam to the community. She said she’d been horrified by some of the things she’d heard people saying about Muslims in her prayer group. Ayaz had reservations. He almost never talked about his religion, and he wasn’t sure it was his responsibility to teach people about it now. On the other hand, he thought how else will people learn, and so three months after the election, Dawson’s first Muslim resident found himself standing on the stage of the high school auditorium in a suit, a bright spotlight shining on him. He squinted, trying to make out the faces in the crowd of nearly 400 people filling up the seats. In the days before, people had been saying the whole thing was an effort to convert Christians to Islam. People had called the school, angry that the event was being held there. Ayaz had worked for weeks on what he would say, writing out an intricate   outline by hand  —   from “step into shoes of Muslim” to “  framework”  —   but when he ran it by Pastor Mandy, she had said no, you need to talk to people on a basic level. They are scared. So he tried to address the tension. “I heard many people were protesting this talk,” he began. “And I have to say, that stings a little bit. I mean, do I look that intimidating?” He laughed, and a few people in the audience laughed. “Do I look like a terrorist?” he said smiling at them, and after talking for an hour about what “99. 99 percent” of Muslims believe, he ended with a slideshow of family photos. “Look! We’re normal!” he said. “That’s our cat!” People applauded and even stood up, and when it was over, some of them submitted questions to be answered later in the community newspaper. “Do Muslims believe in birth control?” “Do the majority of Muslims   other religions?” “Why are terrorist attacks always from Muslims?” When Ayaz read them, he wondered if this was what people were thinking when they saw him walking down the street. Still, he felt good enough about the whole exercise that when he was invited to speak in another town, he agreed, even though he had some reservations about venturing beyond Dawson. Montevideo was 20 minutes east down the highway, a town of 5, 200 people. He’d given a talk on obesity at the hospital there once but otherwise he was a stranger, and when he arrived at the library, about 75 people were waiting, including several men with Bibles. As he began talking about how faith without deeds is meaningless, they began shouting verses at him. They yelled that they were praying for his salvation and called him the antichrist. Their tone became so hostile that Musarrat, who had brought their    daughter, moved to the back of the room, closer to the exit. In the days after, people wrote letters to the local paper saying how embarrassed they were at the doctor’s reception, but Ayaz decided he was done with trying to explain Islam to rural Minnesota.     Ayaz Virji gives a lecture on Islam at City Hall in Granite Falls, Minn. about half an hour from Dawson. Virji decided to give the lecture  —   his third  —   after a librarian asked him to speak. (Salwan   Washington Post)  Except that the invitations kept coming, including the one from Granite Falls. It was 35 minutes east on the highway, a town of 2, 900 people he’d only breezed through once or twice, but Ayaz decided okay, one more. Now fliers with his photo, the date and time of the talk were going up around Granite Falls and on Facebook, where reactions were coming in, including a   from a man whose own photo was superimposed with a huge Confederate flag. “What’s the plan for Thursday?” a nurse asked Ayaz now. It was Tuesday, two days before the talk, and people kept asking him about it with notes of worry in their voices. Pastor Mandy was saying she had a bad feeling. One of his friends told Ayaz that he should have police there. A colleague had mentioned that her husband had a bulletproof vest, and maybe Ayaz would like to borrow it. “We’re going to get security,” Ayaz told the nurse. He was sitting at a computer in the nurse’s station, dictating notes on a patient. “Anxiety, as mentioned, under control, back pain, under control . . . ” “Oh,” the nurse went on. “Don’t do it. ” “Mandy asked if I wanted to cancel,” he said, checking another chart, his leg bouncing. He didn’t want to be paranoid, but he didn’t want to be naive. He kept thinking about the rise in hate crimes since the election. “I said I don’t want to cancel. It’s got me mad. I’ve got all this to think about  —   the talk, and now I have to worry about security. I mean, I’m not Martin Luther King. ” He went back to dictating. “Stress level . . . white   count . . . breathing . . . delirium . . . ” “Granite Falls is a different town,” the nurse continued. “It’s a little bit rough. ” “Okay. Well. Such is life,” Ayaz said, getting up. He headed down the hall to tend to his next patient, which was why he had come to Dawson anyway, he kept reminding himself. He asked a nurse to call a patient about lab work. He went into his office to call a colleague. “Everything okay?” he said into the speakerphone. They were supposed to be talking about a medical equipment issue. “Isn’t today the day you  —   ” the colleague said. “Thursday. It’s Thursday. I decided to do it. So. Yeah,” Ayaz said, and felt his anger rising again. He hung up the phone and stared out the window. He didn’t want to be angry. He knew some of it was because Trump at times reminded him of people who had bullied him growing up, including high school classmates who called him the   and a “  bastard” and made those years “hellish” and “like a prison,” all of which he had tried to escape by telling himself that one day he was going to be respected. One day he was going to lead a decent and dignified life, which is what he was trying to do when he closed his office door just after 1 p. m. He rolled out his mat, prayed, and carried on with the day. On Wednesday night, Pastor Mandy came over to the house to talk through the plan for Granite Falls. “Okay, so,” she was saying. “I’m going to open by reading out of the Bible that there is no fear in love, but love casts out fear. ” “That’s good,” Ayaz said, making a note on his outline. “I think John 14:6 is going to be thrown at you. . . . ‘I am the way and the truth and the light,’ ” Mandy said, referring to the verse many Christians understand to mean that Jesus is the only path to salvation. Ayaz made a note of that, too, and suggested that perhaps she could explain to people how the verse is not necessarily literal. “As soon as I say the Bible is not the literal truth, I’m going to be crucified,” she said. “Okay, don’t do it,” Ayaz said. “Let me be crucified. It’s okay. ” “No, you were crucified in Monte. It’s my turn to be crucified,” Mandy said. “No, I’ll do it,” Ayaz said. “I’m the main enemy. ” He told Mandy he’d found a verse to quote in case someone called him the antichrist again, and began looking for it in his Bible. “Can I ask you a personal question?” she said. “Was that hurtful to you? Be honest. ” “It wasn’t,” he said, not looking up. “How could that not hurt you?” Mandy said. “He called you the embodiment of all that is evil. ” “Didn’t bother me,” Ayaz said, still looking for the verse. “I think that hurt you,” she said. He found it. He read the verse, about how unsparingly Jesus will judge hypocrites. “What do you think of that?” he said. “Do you think that’s good?” On Thursday, he got home from the hospital and went to pick up Maya from school, hurrying along the sidewalk in the bright sunshine and shade of cottonwoods. “Hi, Dr. Virji!” someone called out from a front lawn. “Hey!” Ayaz called back to a woman he knew had voted for Trump. “How are you doing?” He crossed the street and headed toward the school. “Hi, Dr. Virji!” said a kid who had been over to their house often before the election, but not since. “Hey there!” Ayaz called back. When he got home, he went upstairs to change, and came down in his suit. “Does this look okay?” he asked Musarrat. She looked at him. She held his face for a moment. He went into the living room and sat in a chair, waiting for the body armor to arrive. He rubbed his face. The doorbell rang. “Do you want to put it underneath or on top and really make a statement?” the neighbor asked Ayaz as he pulled the bulletproof vest out of the duffle bag. “I don’t want to make a statement,” Ayaz said. He took off his jacket, his tie and his shirt as the neighbor tried to adjust the straps of the vest to make it less bulky. “It doesn’t go any smaller than that?” “No, this is it,” his neighbor said, helping Ayaz put it on over his  . Maya came into the study. “Dad, what are you doing?” she said. “Now I put the shirt on over?” Ayaz said, struggling into his dress shirt. He walked over to a mirror, looked at himself and turned to his neighbor. “I don’t think this is going to work,” he said. “This is very conspicuous. ” He took it off and began getting dressed again. “We really appreciate you doing these talks and stuff,” the neighbor said, zipping the vest back in the duffle bag. “Yeah. Sure,” Ayaz said.    Larry Olson, 74, makes a comment during Ayaz Virji’s lecture on Islam in Granite Falls, Minn. (Salwan   Washington Post)   He was quiet as they drove along Oak Street and out of Dawson, heading east on the narrow highway into the open fields. Musarrat brushed cat hair off his suit jacket. “I think some people are coming from Dawson to be supportive,” she offered. “I know a way they could be supportive,” he said, thinking once again of the vote. “Maybe they are sorry,” Musarrat said. “Would be nice if they said it,” Ayaz said. “I don’t think they regret it. ” They passed through Montevideo and continued farther east. “Ah, goodness,” Ayaz sighed, and soon, they were arriving in Granite Falls, and parking in front of a square brick City Hall with a flapping American flag. Ayaz went inside and made his way to the front of the city council chamber. He stood behind the long dais and looked out at the crowd filling all the chairs in the room and spilling into the lobby. He spotted the two police officers and began scanning faces in the audience for ones that appeared  . A man in khakis and   glasses. A   man holding a Bible. A disheveled, balding man in the lobby, looking at him through the glass door. A   man sitting in the front row, arms folded. Ayaz recognized him. “Hey,” he said to Duane Husted, a neighbor he knew had voted for Trump. “Hey,” Duane said back, and soon Mandy stood up to begin, saying to the crowd, “I encourage you to listen. ” Ayaz glanced at his outline and stood up. He said he hoped what he had to say might lead to a better understanding of one another, which was the point of the talk. “So, with that, I begin in the name of God, the most beneficent and most merciful,” he said, reciting the Islamic phrase that usually comes before prayer. Some people shifted in their chairs. He introduced himself as a doctor who had studied comparative religion at Georgetown with professors who were “the epitome of intellect and scholarship. ” He said that what he learned was that if you want to understand Islam, or anything, “you have to be sincere” and “you have to use your brain. ” He looked around at the crowd. “Because it’s easy to demonize. You know, ‘Everybody else is crazy and I’m just right,’ ” he said sharply. “And what kind of society does that create? That’s what ISIS does. That’s what these zealots do. Do we want to be like that? As Americans, don’t we want to be better than that? We better be better than that. ” He glanced at his outline and made the point that of course  Islam has its zealots, and he condemns them. “But that’s not what we’re talking about,” he said. “Because if you say, ‘That’s Islam,’ then that’s like me saying, ‘Well, Christianity is David Kor esh,’ ” he said, referring to the cult leader. He began pacing a bit. People were listening. “Do you guys know who the LRA is?” he said, referring to the Lord’s Resistance Army, the cultish Ugandan rebel group blamed for the deaths of more than 100, 000 people. “How many of you knew about that? I want you to raise your hands. ” Two hands went up. “How come you don’t know about that?” Ayaz said. “How come only Islam has terrorism? The KKK had 5 million members in the 1920s. Lynching of black people was normal. It was routine. Why don’t we look at ourselves, too, as well as others? You have alternative facts? Then go to a different lecture. ” No one was getting up to leave. “So, the purpose of today is to know one another,” Ayaz continued, going back to the outline. He quoted Koran verses to explain how there is no compulsion to convert people to Islam, how extremists who believe that “hate me more than they hate you,” and how Islam means peace, and soon, he began to veer. “So Islam is not what you see on TV, okay?” he said. “I know Fox News. It’s not news. It’s the WWF, okay? Don’t use them as my spokesperson. When you say, ‘These people are animals and we have to blow them up,’ don’t say, ‘This is Islam.’ It’s not. And 99. 9 percent of us will agree we need to condemn these people and it hurts us even more because they’re saying that God said this? Muhammad said this? Never in a million years. ” His voice was rising. He was getting angry. Mandy looked at him. “Breathe, breathe,” she said. He began talking about Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who had referred to Islam as a “vicious cancer. ” “There are 1. 6 billion Muslims in the world! Now, according to General Flynn, we have to purge them? ‘We have to purge the world of Islam!’ ” he said in a mocking voice. He was far off his outline now. “You can sense I’m angry about that,” he said. “Wasn’t Jesus angry when he went into the temple and knocked over the tables of the money changers? He was angry. Injustice should make us angry! Okay? I am angry about the election. Because there is injustice there, and I have felt that within my family. And with the burning of mosques? And something like 150 bomb threats to Jewish synagogues? We should think. ” He looked at Duane again, a neighbor he had considered a friend before the election but had barely spoken to since. “I’ll tell you. After the election, I was angry. And I was angry at my community for what they did. And I was ready to leave. Okay? I was ready to go and say you know what? Not my job. People think I’m a terrorist? I’m outta here. Fine. Find somebody else. The reason I’m here is not because I want to  —   my faith is very personal to me. I’m here because who else is going to do this, if not me?” People were just sitting there, listening, not saying anything. He asked them to imagine how they would feel if he judged Christians the way some people judge Muslims. If he was dishonest, he said, he would pull out all the most violent Bible verses and say Christianity commands followers to kill. If he was unfair, he would call the Christian cross a “symbol of torture. ” The room was quiet. “How do you feel?” he asked. “Love thy neighbor? Do unto others?” “Why should I come to rural America and help people who think I’m a terrorist and say, ‘Let’s ban these people from coming here! Ban these doctors from coming here!’ ” He looked at his outline. “So, now let’s get to the issues . . . ” he said. “Who believes that Islam supports and promotes terrorism?” No hands. “None of you believe that? Really? Be honest! It’s okay! Nothing’s going to happen! I’m not a terrorist!” Still no hands. He moved on to what the Koran says about women, that they should be treated with dignity, and what Trump had said about grabbing women. “What did he say? What did he say? You know what he said. ” He moved on to sharia. “Sharia,” he said in a menacing voice. “Come on. You guys know. This is the Devil talking! Come on! You guys know this. Sharia. All Muslims want to impose sharia? Chop off your heads and gouge your eyes out? Right? Isn’t that what Muslims want to do? Isn’t that what I want to do?” He kept going, veering on and off his outline, from arcane points of Islamic doctrine to the absurd things people say about Islam, which “are about as stupid as they come. ” He went over the history of Islam in America. He mentioned that Thomas Jefferson hosted what is considered the first iftar dinner, the meal that breaks the fast during the holy month of Ramadan. He talked about refugees. He talked about mercy. He talked and kept talking, and after an hour and a half in which not one person had left the room, Pastor Mandy tapped him on the arm and whispered that he needed to finish. “I gotta do this,” he told her. He had one last thing to say, about judgment. He read the Bible verse he had written down the night before from the Gospel of Matthew, which describes what Jesus will say to those who professed his name but failed him. “And he will say, ‘I never knew you,’ ” Ayaz read. “ ‘Get away from me, you wicked people.’ ” He looked up from his notes at the audience. “He’s telling this to you,” Ayaz said. “So. ” He gathered his outline. “Anyway,” he said. “I’m not going to talk about anything else. ” He sat down. He was exhausted. People shifted in their chairs. Mandy stood up. “Okay,” she said. “So. I think, what we will do is to give some time for people to ask questions. ” Hands went up. “The lady in the back?” Mandy said, and the woman stood up. “I want to thank you,” she said. “These conversations are very much needed. ” She sat down. “Thank you,” Ayaz said, and looked out at all the hands. He called on a man with a beard. “I don’t have a specific question for you, but maybe a comment,” he said. “In the U. S. the way we teach American history, we condense it down so much. We clean it up. We leave out a whole bunch of things. As Christians, we sanitize it even more . . . and you kind of alluded to that. People really need to be honest about our history. ” “I would agree with you, well said,” Ayaz said. “Who’s next?” He scanned the hands, and called on a man with short gray hair, who stood up. “Um, I guess where I’d want to go is simply  —   ” he began, then started over again. “Part of what I want to share with you is this. ” He paused for a moment. “I hear a lot of pain from you this evening. ” Ayaz was looking at him. He was listening. “Um, I’m sorry,” the man said. He sat down. The room was silent. People looked at Ayaz, waiting for his response. He glanced down and then around the room at them, at the two police officers, the man in the tortoise shell glasses, the man with the Bible, the disheveled one, his neighbors. “Thank you for that,” he said. There were a few more questions, and then Ayaz was done talking. He had said everything he wanted to say, and now he listened to the applause.     Downtown Dawson is pictured on May 19. In the November presidential election, Donald Trump had won Lac qui Parle County, where Dawson was the   town, with nearly 60 percent of the vote. (Salwan   Washington Post)  He kept thinking about it all as they headed back west on the highway. “People were very nice,” he said. “Gracious. ” He said that he’d been surprised to see Duane, and some other Dawson people. Musarrat said she saw Lori, Diane, Mary and her husband. “Oh, and then Sandy and her husband,” she said. They passed the same fields they passed before, now in the last light of day. “Was I too negative?” Ayaz asked after a while. Soon it was dark, and their headlights were shining on the “Welcome to Dawson” sign, and the same streets with the same houses and the same people who had seemed to Ayaz so good and so genuine when his family first arrived. In the morning, he would walk to work as usual, and do his rounds as usual, and that’s how he wished things could be. Only now, arriving back in Dawson, he still felt different, more and more like a stranger in a rural Midwestern town. He didn’t want to feel that way. He hoped in time he wouldn’t. He turned onto Pine Street, and then he was home. "
"      June 15, 2015   It is an oppressively humid day in South Florida and Jeb Bush has come home to declare his candidacy for president. The big crowd assembled at Miami Dade College is festive  —   and diverse, reflecting the culture of Miami that has shaped the former governor for decades and the kind of openness he believes his party needs to win the White House. Bush has had a difficult spring, his candidacy buffeted by criticism and   wounds. But in many circles he is still seen as the politician to beat for the Republican nomination.   His speech evokes what he hopes voters will see in him, someone with executive experience, conservative values and a reformer’s instinct  —   and perhaps above all, electability.  “I will take nothing and no one for granted,” he says. The speech draws strong reviews, his best moment yet. For Bush, it is a day to put his problems behind him and begin the campaign anew.    June 16, 2015   The scene at Trump Tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue is surreal. Down the escalator, his image reflecting on the walls around the lobby, comes Donald Trump, the billionaire developer and reality TV star. The crowd gathered in the lobby is large and boisterous. Later it will be revealed that some were paid to attend  —   an arrangement the candidate would not long need.          Trump is there to announce, to the surprise of so many, that he will seek the White House. He has flirted with this before but always stopped short. Now he says he is in. His speech is seemingly off the cuff. He goes after China and President Obama and then turns to immigration. Mexico is sending their worst across the border, he says  —   drug dealers, rapists and murderers among them. The language is harsh  —   shocking to many  —   and draws instant condemnations. For the novice politician, it is an inauspicious start to the campaign.      THE YEAR 2015 will be remembered as one of the most bizarrely compelling and genuinely unnerving in the nation’s modern political history. It is clear now that there were two halves to the year for the Republican Party: BT and AT, Before Trump and After Trump. From January to   the story of the Republican race was mostly conventional, with Bush the focal point for good and ill. There were unanticipated twists, among them the sheer size of the field of candidates  —   ultimately a total of 17 who would formally declare. Those early months, however, were only a prelude to the real events that would follow. It is hardly overstatement to say that, on June 16, everything changed  —   though no one knew it at the time, not even Donald Trump. Trump’s entry brought scorn and dismissal. He was a clown, a carnival barker, the leading man in a sideshow with a short run. His outrageous rhetoric  —   an appeal to nativism and antipathy toward everything from institutional powers to cultural shifts  —   seemed to guarantee all that. Yet even on that day in June there were signs that the elites in the party and in the political community didn’t get what was stirring. From New York, Trump flew to Iowa for a rally at Hoyt Sherman Auditorium in Des Moines, where he was cheered as he strode down the aisle to the front stage. Don and Kathy Watson were among those who had come to see him. Asked why Trump, she replied: “Why not? He’s as good as anybody. . . . He’s not afraid. He’s not a politician. ” They weren’t certain they would support Trump, but they knew which candidate they would not support: Bush. “Dump him. We’ve had too many Bushes,” she said. Trump’s reception that night showed that whatever the party establishment thought of him, many voters found him instantly attractive. Those early sentiments underscored the festering emotions that would soon burst forth, frustrations born of economic stress and disgust with Washington. By the end of the year, every candidate running for the nomination could sense it  —   and all were trying to adapt, channeling the anger as best they could. Some adapted well, and may yet win the nomination. Others didn’t make it to the New Year. Aboard his campaign bus in Iowa two days before the arrival of 2016, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida reflected on what he had seen and felt through the amazing year of 2015. “People are just tired,” he said. “They’ve tried Democrats, they’ve tried Republicans. They’ve tried a combination of both. They’ve tried new people, they’ve tried old people and nothing changes. Things get worse. They don’t seem to get better, no matter who’s in charge; it feels like the country is stuck in neutral and people are fed up and that’s what brings us to the point where we’re at today. ” What Rubio said was an echo of what almost every Republican candidate was saying by the end of the year. But as the election year opens, the lingering question  —   the big unknown  —   is whether 2015 will prove to be an aberration, a holiday from reality or a portent of things to come. What is clearest is what didn’t work in 2015, though it often worked in the past. Television advertising moved few voters. Policy rollouts fell on deaf ears. Impressive political résumés proved not to be persuasive. What took on the Republican side was a new kind of politics, one built on emotion and visceral connection. To some people, this represented a worrying turn toward a darker and more divisive politics. To others, it was a welcome turn away from what they considered to be too much political correctness. Rick Santorum said of Trump: “He may have understood the game better than any of us. ” But like so many people, the former senator from Pennsylvania wondered whether the billionaire mogul understands the game ahead. It is the question that hovers over everything in politics at this moment. “I think the vote is much different than a poll and so I want to see what happens when people actually vote,” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in evaluating 2015. “Then we can start talking about eras being defined or newly established. ” The answer will come soon enough. What follows is the story of how Republicans got to where they are today, told primarily through the impressions, recollections and analyses of those who lived it personally  —   the Republican candidates. This article is based almost entirely on    interviews with most of the major candidates  —   some of whom fell away  —   and with their advisers and other strategists. It is the story of a remarkable year in American politics.        THE QUESTION THAT HOVERED over the Republican Party a year ago was very different: Will he or won’t he? In late 2014, the he in question was Jeb Bush. A son and brother of presidents. A towering figure in Florida politics. A cerebral executive celebrated for his policy chops and conservative record as governor. Though hobbled by his support for immigration reform and Common Core educational standards, Bush was seen by party elites as a man literally groomed for the office  —   a president at the ready. The reality would prove to be more complicated. Out of office for eight years, Bush was rusty, and through the fights of the Obama era that reordered the political right, he was largely absent.  To demonstrate that he was in touch with politics in the age of social media, Bush went on Facebook on Dec. 17 to declare that he was actively exploring a run. The announcement landed like a thunderclap, instantly thrusting him to the top and undercutting a slew of other establishment hopefuls, especially Christie and Rubio. “Any time someone with the last name Bush gets into a national race, the first impact you feel is fundraising, and that’s certainly the one that we felt most immediately,” Christie would later recall. “A lot of people started to sign on with him before we’d even gotten off the ground. It was his attempt, I think, to preempt the field. ” Sally Bradshaw, senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said there was no expectation of clearing the field  —   quite the opposite. “We knew this would be a more crowded and talented field than 2012 and we knew the electorate was angry at President Obama,” she said. “We assumed there would be an establishment candidate or several and an anger candidate. Our assumption was that [the anger candidate] would be Ted Cruz. No one anticipated a Trump candidacy at that point. ” Bush’s aggressive effort to raise funds in early 2015, Bradshaw said, reflected the campaign team’s assumption that the nomination contest would be highly competitive and potentially lengthy. “Shock and awe” is how it came to be called, to the chagrin of Bradshaw and others. Still, it was a genuine blitzkrieg. Bush’s advisers established Right to Rise, a super PAC that could accept unlimited contributions, and it vacuumed up big checks by the day. On Jan. 9, it received its first $1 million contribution, from Los Angeles investment banker Brad Freeman. By February, Bush was averaging one fundraiser a day and regularly headlining events with a minimum price tag of $100, 000 a person, such as the Feb. 11 gathering at the Park Avenue home of   titan Henry Kravis. Longtime Bush family fundraiser Fred Zeidman recalled: “Everyone was enthusiastic, everyone was writing checks. That had always been the benchmark. Money has been the way you keep score. ” The intense early pace startled Bush’s likely opponents. “I think everybody was a little surprised as to not just the timing but how successful he was early on,” Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recalled later. Donors who had been contemplating backing Christie, Rubio or Walker were suddenly on board with Bush. “Are they raising a lot of money? Yeah,” Ray Washburne, a Dallas real estate developer who was leading Christie’s fundraising efforts, said at the time. Washburne’s candidate was not. “We’re in the   stage. ”    Former Florida governor Jeb Bush officially launched his presidential campaign in Miami on Monday, saying ”the presidency should not be passed on from one liberal to the next.” (AP)   The swaggering entrance of Bush was perhaps most acutely felt by Rubio. Bush’s onetime protégé, Rubio enjoyed an overlapping donor network with him, especially in their shared home state of Florida. Yet at the onset of the   invisible primary, many of these people were publicly signing on with Bush before Rubio could even make the hard sell.  “It just changes completely the way you have to go out and raise money,” Rubio recalled later. He said he resorted to building a more   donor network, as he did in his 2010 Senate race when he began far behind the   candidate of party leaders,  . Charlie Crist. “You have to find new people that haven’t traditionally been involved in the past, but want to see a change in America. ” As Bush jetted from mansion to mansion securing donors, Bradshaw and Bush’s longtime political consigliere, Mike Murphy, were mapping out the campaign. They were confident about Bush’s chances to be the nominee. Sure, he would have to overcome America’s historical aversion to dynastic politics and the country’s lingering distaste for the George W. Bush years. But he would easily establish his own political identity, they figured. He had done it in Florida. His campaign signs and bumper stickers always bore the logo, “Jeb! ,” with a giant red exclamation point emphasizing that he was not just another Bush. They would do so again. Bradshaw and Murphy envisioned the general election against Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee. They would try to master the data and digital frontier that Obama so effectively exploited and that had bedeviled Republicans. Bush would visit urban areas and tour schools in impoverished neighborhoods. He would deliver an optimistic pitch to the middle class. He would woo Latinos with a compassionate approach to immigration, by campaigning in Spanish and by showcasing his Mexican American wife and blended family. His slogan would be “right to rise,” a shot for everyone to climb up the income ladder. Out in the heartland, there were rumblings of resistance among the constituency that had not yet shown much interest in a third Bush presidency: voters. A dozen   residents  —   Republicans, Democrats and independents  —   registered a startlingly negative view on Bush during a   focus group moderated by Democratic pollster Peter Hart for the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. When an information technology program manager named Charlie Loan, a   independent, said   that he would be happy to see Congress pass a law banning anyone named Bush or Clinton from running for president, half the people in the room agreed. And when the participants were asked for short impressions of Bush, the responses included: “No, thank you;” “Greedy;” and, “Again?” The closest anyone came to showing enthusiasm for Bush was, “intriguing. ”     AS BUSH WAS FAST BUILDING his juggernaut, a threat emerged on the horizon. Mitt Romney, who had run for president twice before, had grown restless in the two years since conceding to Obama. The world seemed like it was on fire; back home, the middle class was getting crushed. Romney was itching to get back in the game, to have a shot at turning things around. One night in early January, aboard a   flight from San Francisco to Boston, Romney wrote in his journal: “If I want to be president, I’m going to have to run for president. ” In Romney’s mind, there was no if. And at a Jan. 9 gathering of some of his top 2012 campaign donors in Manhattan, hosted by New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, he made his feelings known. “I want to be president,” Romney told the assembled financiers. Romney’s surprising declaration electrified the Republican money and operative class and set off a tumultuous   period of public deliberation. “This wasn’t going to happen by a claim of some kind or other people having a difficult time getting traction and then people turning to me and asking me to run,” Romney recalled thinking at the time. “If I wanted to be president, it was a decision I had to make. And Jeb, I think very wisely, had begun raising money and getting things started early on, so the time frame to make that decision was earlier than I might have thought. ” Romney called his former donors, dozens of them, and received encouraging feedback. His chief fundraiser, Spencer Zwick, estimated that they could raise the $100 million or so necessary to get through the primaries. Longtime adviser Beth Myers assured him he could assemble a   staff.    Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, with his wife, Ann, at the height of his   flirtation with a presidential run in January 2015. He opted out on Jan. 30. (Gregory  )  Strategist Stuart Stevens kept counseling Romney to make a personal decision, not a political one, though Romney studied the politics closely. Chicago investor Muneer Satter, a GOP   commissioned polls from a dozen or so states and showed the data to Romney. “Am I loved? Am I written off? Am I despised? What does the Republican base think about me?” Romney recalled wondering. He liked what he saw. Romney said the polls showed him with commanding leads among potential Republican candidates in New Hampshire and Nevada and a smaller lead in Iowa. In South Carolina, he was tied at the top with Bush and others. “It’s like, ‘Wow. Wow.’ That’s not a bad place to start from,” Romney said in a   interview in Boston at the   offices of Solamere Capital, the private equity firm run by Zwick and Romney’s eldest son, Tagg. Romney thought that if he got in, he was better positioned than anybody else to get the nomination. He was more concerned about the general election. He saw Clinton  —   because of both the historic nature of her candidacy and the demographic advantages Democrats enjoy at the presidential level  —   as a formidable opponent. The reaction outside Romney’s orbit was less rosy. Governors, senators and other Republican leaders called him a decent man who has served the party well, but said his time had passed. On the right, the criticism was sharper. The Wall Street Journal editorial board lacerated him in a column headlined, “Romney Recycled. ” Rupert Murdoch, whose company owns the Journal and Fox News Channel, said: “He had his chance, he mishandled it, you know? I thought Romney was a terrible candidate. ” Talk radio host Mark Levin summed up the sentiment in a tweet: “Been there, done that. ” Of the barrage of negativity, Romney suspected a culprit: “I recognized the hand of my good friend, Mike Murphy, [who] in my view was fanning the flames of, ‘No, he’s the disaster. It would be terrible. Only Jeb!’ I must admit that had the opposite effect [than] he might have intended, which is just like, ‘I’ll show them.’ ” Murphy, the Bush adviser, said this was “absolutely not true” and that he did not talk down Romney’s chances with commentators, governors or senators. “I’m sorry he thinks that,” Murphy said, noting his long relationship with Romney. “I think the doubts were more organic than he believes. ” Romney believed that, if he passed on the race, Bush would be the most likely nominee. Privately, he harbored serious doubts about Bush’s ability to beat Clinton. He recalled thinking, “I like Jeb a lot, I think he’d be a great president, but felt he was unfairly but severely burdened by the W. years  —   and when I say the W. years, it’s not only what happened to the economy, but the tragedy in Iraq. ” He added, “A       would be too easy for the Democrats. ” On Jan. 22, Bush flew to Utah, where the Romneys were settling into a new home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Holladay, to pay Mitt a courtesy visit. The date had been set long before Romney expressed interest in running. The two men exchanged pleasantries and updated each other on their growing families; four days earlier, Romney’s 23rd grandchild was born. Then they got down to business. Romney told Bush about the private polls that showed him performing well in the early voting states. “It’s opened up a door that I didn’t think would be open to me,” he recalled telling Bush. Romney also said he confronted Bush with his fears about his candidacy: “Jeb, to be very honest, I think it’s very hard for you to post up against Hillary Clinton and to separate yourself from the difficulty of the W. years and compare them with the Clinton years. ” He said Bush responded by saying that “he was going to make his campaign about the future, not about the past. ” “I didn’t say anything at that point,” Romney recalled. “But as he left, I said to myself, ‘Gosh, in my opinion, it’s not going to be as easy to make that separation as I think he gives the impression it will be.’ One of the few things I predicted that turned out to be true. ” Bush, through a spokesman, declined repeated requests to be interviewed. Bradshaw said: “We don’t talk about meetings that we consider to be private. We’re honoring Governor Bush’s commitment to Governor Romney to keep the meeting private. Governor Bush appreciates what Mitt did in waging an able campaign and leading our ticket. ” With his exploration continuing in public, Romney more and more was leaning against running. Wife Ann supported the idea and wanted Mitt to be president, but their five sons were split. Tagg and Josh were for it, Matt and Craig were against it and Ben was on the fence. Romney suspected their wives were opposed, though they kept their opinions to themselves. Romney privately consulted two of his closest friends in elected office: Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, his 2012 vice presidential   whom he earlier had been badgering to run himself to no avail; and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. They didn’t discourage Romney, but neither did they push him to jump in. “They were friendly and encouraging,” Romney recalled, “but cautious and saying, ‘Gosh, we need an elder statesman in the party. . . . If you get into the race, why it diminishes you. You’re now one of the big crowd of people running and you lose the impact you could have had.’ And they said, ‘Maybe you’re not as able to win the general as perhaps someone coming along.’ ” Romney was arriving at the same conclusion. He remembered thinking, “It’s going to take something unusual, something catching lightning in a jar to beat [Clinton] and the guy who ran before isn’t very likely to catch lightning in a jar. I’m too well known. I’m too well defined. ” On Jan. 30, exactly three weeks after declaring in New York that he wanted to be president, Romney announced that he was giving up on the dream. He did so with what many interpreted as a knock against the   Bush. “I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders  —   one who may not be as   as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started  —   may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democratic nominee,” Romney said. “In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case. ”  SOME OF THOSE YOUNG STARS Romney had in mind were fresh off another successful midterm election. Descending on Florida for the Republican Governors Association’s annual meeting, they were ebullient and looking ahead to their possible White House runs. It was only November of 2014, but the corridors of the ornate Boca Raton Resort & Club were a grand bazaar of political gossip and speculation. Greg Abbott, just elected governor of Texas, joked, “I think everyone in this building is running for president. ”     AS THEY LOOKED toward 2016, many Republicans believed the nomination battle would become a fight among the governors. The state executives were stars in the party, seen as models of conservative governance in contrast to the dysfunctional family of Republicans in Congress. Moreover, at a time of public disenchantment with President Obama, who was elected more on charisma than experience and whom Republicans derided as never having run anything before, the governors thought they would be the likeliest antidote. The list of prospective candidates from these ranks was long: the outgoing Texas governor Rick Perry, who after a record 14 years in office could boast of sizeable job creation numbers; Christie, who began 2014 in scandal surrounding the closure of lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge but ended it taking a victory lap as outgoing Republican Governors Association chair; Ohio Gov. John Kasich, newly reelected in a landslide in one of the most important swing states in the country; Walker, nationally known among conservatives for his battles with unions and who won three tough elections in four years; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a policy wonk and idea generator. Those were just the sitting governors. Beyond that were the former governors: Bush, Mike Huckabee (Ark.) George Pataki (N. Y.) and Jim Gilmore (Va. ). Governors appeared to have the best of both worlds: experienced as chief executives and able to portray themselves as Washington outsiders. As Walker explained more than a year later, governors “could all make an argument that we were outside of Washington, that we’re getting things done, that we were part of a movement of governors across the country  —   all of which is accurate. ” Many of the governors who were preparing to run had one overriding goal in mind: to become the alternative to Bush. In Bush’s camp, the other governors loomed largest as potential competitors, although which one was most threatening remained a mystery. Perry, who had run a disastrous race for president in 2012 and had spent two years preparing for a second campaign, already could see the landscape ahead  —   a nomination contest that ultimately would come down to a competition between two men who had led two of the biggest states in the country. “I full well thought that by the fall of 2015, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry were going to be on the stage having a thoughtful conversation about each of our competing visions for America and us comparing our records of success,” Perry said in a December interview. Perry judged himself and Bush to be “two of the most successful Republican governors maybe in the history of the country. ” Surely, he believed, “the American people would distill down which of these individuals had the best vision for America. . . . It was going to be me and Jeb. ” The challenge was to break out from the pack. The first to do so was Walker, who delivered a fiery speech on Jan. 24 in Iowa at a   Freedom Summit, sponsored by the group Citizens United and hosted by Rep. Steve King, one of the most conservative members of Congress. By showing real passion, the bland politician had surprised those who didn’t know him  —   including many in the national press corps who had descended on Des Moines for the first major Republican event of the cycle. Conservative talk radio was abuzz about him. For days on end, Rush Limbaugh hailed the Wisconsinite as the cure to what ails the Republican Party.    Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker prepares to ride a motorcycle during a June 2015 political fundraiser in Des Moines, Iowa. Walker said he quickly came to see that the later focus on Trump kept him from breaking through. (Jabin   Washington Post)  At the time, Walker later recalled, he found it amusing. “I laughed with the coverage that came out  —   ‘Oh, Walker gives his breakout speech,’ ” he said. In his own mind, it was no different than the performances he delivered on factory floors or at small rallies during his reelection in the fall of 2014. The media attention to Walker gave him a significant boost, even though others such as Cruz, the senator from Texas, and even Trump stirred the conservative audience nearly as much. With the attention came a brighter spotlight, and Walker then suffered through a series of errors. In London, during an official state business trip, he declined to say whether he believed in evolution. In an interview, he wouldn’t say whether he believed Obama was a Christian. At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, he appeared to cast his battles with the unions as a proving ground for his capacity to deal with Islamic State militants. Walker wrote off the incidents as minor problems. And the missteps did not arrest his rise, at least not then. He soon became the poll leader in Iowa and, in the quickly congealing world of conventional wisdom, was described as the principal challenger to Bush. As he traveled the country early in the year, Walker believed he was particularly well suited for a GOP electorate whose frustrations, even with their own party leaders in Washington, he could feel. “Part of our assessment was, I can say I’m the guy who didn’t back down. If you want somebody who’s going to stand up and get these sorts of things done, I can do it, I did at Wisconsin, we can do it going forward,” Walker recalled. “I think that was part of our initial appeal. What we didn’t see coming along the way was just how intense that frustration was. ”        IF GOVERNORS PLANNED to run on their records of enacting reforms back home, a trio of   senators were hanging their hopes on their potential to disrupt Washington’s established order. The first out of the gate was Cruz, a combative conservative who, in his 14 months in the Senate, had made many more enemies than friends. An Ivy   lawyer, Cruz already had proven himself a smooth orator and wily tactician. He was best known for leading a 2013 crusade against Obama’s health care law that resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government.  Cruz arrived on the presidential stage as a hero to tea party activists, but he had another objective: to make himself a hero to evangelical Christians and libertarian conservatives, too. “Conservatives have always outnumbered moderates in a primary, but the way moderates have won previously is by dividing conservatives,” Cruz would later say. “Their strategy was to keep conservatives splintered. If conservatives ever unite, it’s game over. ”    Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) announced his intention to run for president in the 2016 election during a speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. (AP)   So on March 23, Cruz journeyed to Lynchburg, Va. to formally announce his candidacy at Liberty University, the private Christian college founded by televangelist Jerry Falwell. It was a splashy event. He spoke in the round at Liberty’s basketball arena before 10, 000 cheering students. Like a pastor, he paced around the stage, no notes in hand, and gestured theatrically. He shared history lessons, invoked the Constitution and declared himself to be an uncompromising conservative and a champion of Christian values. Thanks to his national profile in the Senate, Cruz had a powerful network of   donors, as had conservative   candidates of presidential campaigns past. But even before announcing, he was moving stealthily and aggressively to woo wealthy power brokers in his home state of Texas, on Wall Street and beyond. Energy investor Toby Neugebauer first met Cruz years ago and the two men, born just a few days apart, quickly clicked. Their families vacationed together. By February, Neugebauer had grown concerned there was not an effective,   super PAC operation to bolster Cruz. Neugebauer said to his wife, “Either we believe or we don’t believe. ” And he soon approached other wealthy Cruz backers, over Texas barbecue and at Manhattan    with a proposition: If they put $10 million into a network of super PACs, so would he. On April 9, Neugebauer wrote a check for $10 million. The next day, hedge fund executive Robert Mercer put in $11 million. And soon enough, Farris and Dan Wilks, brothers whose fracking services business had transformed them into billionaires, and their wives anted up $15 million. “The money made the Cruz candidacy very real,” Neugebauer said, adding: “People realized, ‘This isn’t Michele Bachmann.’ ” Cruz’s campaign now had what no recent   conservative candidate had: the resources to run a long campaign.      Sen. Ted Cruz ( .) began his presidential campaign as a hero to tea party activists, but he also was keen to become one to evangelical Christians and libertarian conservatives. (Jahi   Washington Post)  For Rand Paul in Kentucky, the ambitions on display across the Appalachian Mountains at Liberty represented a sudden threat, though Paul might not have recognized it at the time. Paul, a   maverick, embodied the tea party movement of 2010 when he catapulted from an ophthalmology practice in Bowling Green to the Senate. Paul’s father, Ron, had rallied libertarians during two quixotic bids for the presidency. Now Rand was aiming to do what his dad never could: win the Republican nomination. Central to Paul’s hopes was expanding his base of libertarians and college students by picking up support from evangelicals. He was coming off an impressive 2014, when he traversed the country in the midterms, building alliances and courting   donors. He was organizing in Iowa, where some saw him as a genuine contender. Paul also was trying to grow the Republican Party’s cultural reach, giving speeches about race and other topics in such liberal enclaves as Berkeley, Calif. In a Louisville ballroom on April 7, Paul declared his candidacy: “I have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back. ” It was a day full of promise. Voters, Paul knew, were growing angry with what he derided as “the Washington machine. ” Who better to win the nomination than a fiercely libertarian eye    legislator? Little did he know then that a louder, brasher and angrier outsider would soon step forward. This was a busy week in presidential politics. That Sunday, Clinton entered the race with studied understatement: a   and folksy video that featured little of the former first lady and secretary of state in favor of a diverse assortment of Americans talking about their hopes and aspirations for the spring. “Everyday Americans need a champion,” Clinton said, “and I want to be that champion. ” In Miami, Rubio and his advisers could hardly believe their good fortune. In just 24 hours, the ambitious young senator was set to make his formal announcement. What better way to enter the race than with a visceral comparison to the leading Democrat? For Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, a compelling biography helped accelerate his ascent in Florida politics. And to accentuate his story under the national spotlight, Rubio launched his campaign at the Freedom Tower, an iconic Ellis   landmark in downtown Miami where a generation earlier U. S. officials processed Cuban refugees fleeing the Castro regime. Rubio had been elected to the Senate in 2010 after taking on and defeating the establishment. After the party’s crushing defeat in the 2012 presidential election, he was a leading member of the Senate’s Gang of Eight that drafted an immigration reform bill, which included a path to citizenship for those here illegally. He walked away from the legislation when sentiment inside the party shifted against that provision. But the issue remains a flash point in the Republican race to this day  —   and potentially one of Rubio’s biggest obstacles. Rubio stepped forward under a banner that read, “A New American Century. ” Charismatic and boyish  —   he was 43, but could have passed for a few years younger  —   Rubio offered himself as a   president for a rapidly changing world. It was time, he said, to close the books on the past. Though he didn’t say their names, it was clear what he meant: the era of politics dominated by people named Clinton and Bush.  “Yesterday is over,” he said, “and we are never going back. ” Rubio now says his “yesterday” contrast was not only generational, but also about old ideas and stale solutions. “Ultimately, to the extent that there are people running who are not in touch with the realities of the 21st century, that contrast is going to be there,” he said.     IN ALMOST EVERY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, someone unexpected rises toward the top of the field. In 2015, that role fell to Ben Carson, a   pediatric neurosurgeon with no political experience. He would come to symbolize the hunger among many Republicans for someone, anyone, not tainted by politics as usual. Carson was a novice to politics but has attracted a substantial following among conservatives and evangelicals. His life story was as compelling as any of the others seeking the presidency, if not greatly more so  —   a rise from poverty in his home town of Detroit to the top ranks of the medical profession. He broke onto the political scene two years earlier at the National Prayer Breakfast, when he sharply criticized Obama, who was sitting nearby. Carson’s demeanor was jarringly calm in the   world of national politics, which proved to be an early asset. But the transition from medicine, paid speaking and honorary degrees was not always smooth. “The question at the beginning was whether we could raise money,” said Barry Bennett, a GOP campaign veteran who was brought on by Carson to manage his campaign. “So we started a fundraising list as Jeb’s super PAC was aiming for $100 million. That was hanging over us. We wondered, ‘Could we compete?’ ” Millions poured in from his email list, which would grow to 3 million addresses, and from   solicitations. Carson had won informal straw polls across the country and became a phenomenon of sorts on the right  —   a kinder, gentler vessel for the frustrations within the Republican base. “It was an outpouring of emotion for an   person, very real, and a feeling, an emotion that the polls were never able to capture,” said Terry Giles, a former Carson adviser. Carson was also a threat to some of those on the right who legitimately believed they were the rightful candidates to appeal to the wide swath of evangelical Christians who play an influential role in Iowa and many southern states. Within weeks of Carson’s declaration of candidacy, Huckabee and former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania also joined the race. They were the two previous winners of the Iowa caucuses, both over Romney  —   Huckabee in 2008 and Santorum by an eyelash in 2012. Both were overshadowed by conservative newcomers and struggled to regain the support they had previously enjoyed. Huckabee would compare the dynamic to junior high school and boys’ fascination with the newest pretty girl in class. “I’m seeing a lot of that in the presidential race,” he said in a December interview. “It’s that there’s the     approach where you’ve got so many new girls in school. Some of us, we’ve been here since the first grade, so we’re having to just wait our turn to be remembered and liked again. ” Santorum said he anticipated that this would be the year of outsiders and felt that his 2012 campaign gave him credibility to tap the   mood. “From my perspective, that’s what I did last time,” he said. “I took on the establishment. Four years had passed and there were more people doing the same thing and in a   way. . . . We were not in the headlines, not top of mind. We had been out of the fray. So from my perspective, I was starting all over again. ”    Ben Carson, left, meets a voter at a December 2015 rally in Keene, N. H. After benefitting from his outsider status early on, he began to fall in polls that month following his reactions to the terrorist attacks in Paris. (Melina   Washington Post)  The field of declared candidates grew quickly after Carson announced. The month of May brought in the only woman, Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive at   who lost a Senate race in California in 2010 in her only venture into politics. Also joining were Pataki and Sen. Lindsey Graham (S. C.). Rubio would later joke: “We live in a year when one out of six Republicans is running for president. ”  Perry’s formal announcement came on June 4 at an airplane hangar north of Dallas. The backdrops included a   transport plane similar to one that he had flown in the Air Force, a group of military veterans and an American flag that ran almost from floor to ceiling on one wall. Perry’s speech laid down markers that he hoped would separate him from many of the others. The 2016 election, he said, would be a “  don’  ” election, where voters prized records over rhetoric. “The question of every candidate will be this one: when have you led?” he said. “Leadership is not a speech on the Senate floor. It’s not what you say, it’s what you do. ”     DESPITE THE GROWING FIELD and the unsettled nature of the polls, much of the focus in the late spring remained on Bush, who struggled to connect with voters even as he excelled at raising money. By late April, Bush had something big to tout when he addressed 350 of his top financial supporters at a   donor retreat at Miami Beach’s 1 Hotel, an   establishment with stunning vistas of the Atlantic Ocean. The organization had already raised more money in 100 days than any other Republican operation in modern history, he told them. Still, some allies were restless. Why wouldn’t he just make it official and launch his campaign already? Why had his fundraising success not intimidated possible rivals from entering the race? At an April   in New Hampshire, Bush laughed when a woman said he seemed to be the establishment’s chosen one and that she did not want to see a Republican coronation to match what she believed was happening with the Democrats. “I don’t see any coronation coming my way,” Bush responded. “Trust me. ” Murphy, the strategist, tried to quiet the concerns of donors who would have been happy with a coronation. During a   briefing, he laid out the long game plan for Bush to secure the nomination and shrugged off the early polls as “noise meters. ” But shortly after Miami Beach, Bush inadvertently sparked another brush fire. When asked at a private donor meeting in New York in early May to whom he relied upon for advice on U. S.  policy, he gave a surprising response: his brother, President Bush. Suddenly, Bush was being pressed on the campaign trail to assess his brother’s legacy and most specifically the decision to invade Iraq. He stumbled for days, initially backing his brother’s decision, before asserting that, if he had known at the time that the intelligence was faulty, he would not have launched the invasion. Bush’s donors and other backers continued to express concerns privately about his prospects. In an effort to build a more nimble and effective operation, Bush announced staff changes in the days before his formal announcement. The   added to the worries of many Bush loyalists, but campaign officials insisted that they were on track to win.  July 4, 2015  It is the midway point of the   year, a weekend for picnics, parades and candidate sightings in New Hampshire. Mitt and Ann Romney open their spacious summer home on Lake Winnipesaukee for some guests in the area: Marco Rubio and Chris Christie, two rivals for the nomination, and their families. Both candidates are planning to march in the parade in nearby Wolfeboro, where the Romneys are an annual presence along the route.   Mitt Romney, in   and shorts, cooks pancakes. Ann Romney, in her robe, fries the bacon as the guests assemble for breakfast. Politics is not on the agenda. But there is little relaxing on any weekend with the Romneys at the lake. There are boat rides and a trip for ice cream and a water slide into what Rubio, conditioned to the climes of South Florida, describes as freezing water.   It is a moment of congeniality in what everyone knows will only become more heated and personal. Rubio talks some pro football. It is July and he is still hopeful that his Miami Dolphins will actually field a competitive team for the season. He and Christie, both still low in the polls, are quietly hopeful that their seasons ahead will be successful as well.      DONALD TRUMP’S BOEING 757 landed with a roar at Phoenix’s airport on a warm July afternoon. He stepped onto the tarmac in his uniform of dark suit and red tie  —   wisps of that famous hair turned up by the wind  —   and into a waiting black GMC Denali with a “TRUMP” license plate. For the first time since his announcement, Trump’s seemingly   presidential bid began to have the aura of a real, vibrating campaign:   stops, a plane full of aides and security guards and piles of printed news articles about him and his rivals. “Let’s go! Let’s go!” Trump said, clapping his hands in the style of a drill sergeant, as his entourage loaded into the caravan. In a region where illegal immigration has inflamed the public, Trump had come to capitalize on the issue. Approaching the venue, he marveled from behind the vehicle’s tinted glass at the thousands who had come to hear what he would say. Trump later would acknowledge that he had been taken by surprise by the power of the immigration issue. “When I made this speech about illegal immigration, I had no idea what it was going to become,” Trump said. “I mean, it was an important subject to me but I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way it has. ” The Phoenix rally was strategically chosen to stoke the issue further. “We really wanted to punctuate where illegal immigration has had the most impact,” said Corey Lewandowski, Trump’s   and   campaign manager. Backstage that day, Trump could hear the crowd stomping its feet and breaking into spontaneous cheers as his fans waited and sang along to his mix of Broadway tunes and   classics on the loudspeakers. But instead of relaxing in his green room, Trump never even opened the door. He met for 20 minutes with families of people who were killed by illegal immigrants, taking pictures with each relative. The Phoenix rally came just days after an illegal immigrant, who had been deported five times, shot and killed Kate Steinle, 32, as she walked along a pier with her father in San Francisco. Trump treated local conservative politicians like old friends, including the controversial sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio. He encouraged a GOP state treasurer to challenge Sen. John McCain ( .) in a primary. “This is a movement,” he told a Washington Post reporter that day. He said it as a way of explaining the scene. But it sounded, too, like an assurance to himself. National polls were charting an unexpected Trump surge. Days after he announced, an   Street Journal poll showed him at just 1 percent, with Bush at 22 percent. A week after the announcement, a Fox News poll put him at 11 percent to Bush’s 15 percent. A week after the Phoenix rally, a   News poll showed Trump at 24 percent to Bush’s 12 percent. Bush would never lead again. Despite the polls, few political strategists took Trump seriously. Nor were candidates seeing a need to fundamentally adapt their strategies. That soon began to change once it became clear that Trump was playing by different rules.      Donald Trump on screen, behind the scenes, at a December 2015 campaign rally in Manassas, Va. Perhaps not surprisingly, he has used television to great advantage. (Charles   Washington Post)  The first example came a week after the Arizona rally. At a Family Leader candidate summit in Iowa, Trump disparaged McCain, the party’s 2008 nominee and a Vietnam War POW who endured repeated torture. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. With a tone of sarcasm, he continued: “He’s a war hero because he was captured? I like people that weren’t captured. ” Denunciations rained down on Trump. Candidates who had declined to criticize him for his immigration pitch suddenly felt emboldened to speak out. Surely, concluded many commentators, the attacks on McCain will bring a swift end to the Trump boomlet. “I think the beginning of the end has come,” said Graham, himself a candidate and a close friend of McCain. “The beginning of the end has arrived because he’s crossed a line with the American people that will not be tolerated. ” Graham’s feud with Trump had begun even before the McCain attack. Trump’s immigration comments, he said, are “going to kill my party. ” Trump, in retaliation, read aloud Graham’s cell phone number at one of his rallies. Graham responded first by changing numbers and then by producing a hilarious video on the many ways to destroy a cellphone.   But Trump’s surge continued, presenting all the candidates with a dilemma. Should they attack him, in hopes of accelerating what many thought would be an ultimate decline, or should they stay on course and hope that Trump would fade on his own? Bush’s advisers telegraphed their theory: Bush would benefit from the amount of attention Trump was getting because he was drowning out the other candidates, including Walker and Rubio, who were positioning themselves to become Bush’s main rival. But that assumption was based on the false premise that the Trump candidacy would burn itself out. For Cruz, the   senator, the playbook was counterintuitive: praise Trump whenever possible and steer clear of direct engagement. The senator from Texas hoped Trump’s supporters would be future Cruz voters, when and if Trump slipped. “I think he’s terrific,” Cruz said in a Fox News interview at the time. Others hoped that the Trump phenomenon would run its course naturally. “Obviously Donald said things about us and we’ve had to respond to some of that,” said Rubio, who at various points found himself a target of Trump’s insults. “But even there we’ve tried to spend very little time doing that because every second I spend responding to his statement of the day is a second I’m not using to talk to voters about the future of America. ” Trump’s candidacy benefited immensely from the fact that he had spent a decade hosting the NBC television program “The Apprentice. ” His celebrity appeal, combined with his blunt talk, produced a candidate unlike anything seen in the modern era of politics. “We’ve never had someone, at least not in my lifetime, who was running for president before who, for the seven or eight years before that, had a   rated national television show,” Christie said. “You cannot discount the celebrity factor in all this. ” Santorum offered a similar analysis: “He’s the same as he was on ‘The Apprentice.’ There is a sense of authenticity even though he’s all over the place on issues. . . . It’s, ‘We know that guy.’ ” Bush and others jabbed at Trump over immigration in those early weeks, but it was Perry who decided to make a frontal attack. Perry’s rhetorical broadside came on July 22 in Washington.   “He offers a barking carnival act that can be best described as Trumpism: a toxic mix of demagoguery,   and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued,” he said. Perry called Trump’s candidacy “a cancer on conservatism and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded. ” Many saw Perry’s attacks as a move of desperation by a candidate hoping to raise his poll numbers enough to make the main debate stage. Asked recently why he had given the speech, Perry said, “Because it was true, and that’s what I felt. ”     AFTER MONTHS OF POSITIONING, the candidates descended on Cleveland to share a debate stage for the first time. There were 17 of them  —   so many that they had to be divided into two groups: the top 10 would debate at  ; the others in an earlier undercard. The leading candidates were escorted out of their green rooms and into a freight elevator. Together, they rode down to the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena, where the lights were shining bright and the Fox News anchors were made up and ready to start asking questions. Not in recent memory had the party fielded such a deep roster, nor had a primary debate been so hotly anticipated. Then again, a candidate like Donald Trump had never led the polls. In the elevator, the nervous energy was palpable. The presidential aspirants were checking each other out, perhaps thinking that 11 months from that day, only one of them would be returning to this very arena, at the Republican National Convention, to accept the nomination. Matt Borges, the Ohio GOP chairman, made sure to be along for the ride: “Even for a grizzled old advance guy like me, that was a cool moment. ” For all the takes on what a Trump nomination might portend for the GOP brand or for conservatism itself, most Republicans agreed on what the nuclear scenario would be: Trump running in the general election as an independent. That would so divide conservative voters, they believed, that Clinton would waltz into the White House. The first question tried to settle it once and for all.   Bret Baier asked for a show of hands for anyone unwilling to support the eventual nominee and disavow an independent run. Trump, standing center stage, glanced quickly to his right. Not a single hand was in the air. Until he raised his. It was the start of a rollicking night in which Trump landed on the debate stage like a hand grenade, as he had from the day of his announcement. As Kasich later observed, “If I said one of the things he had said about Hispanics, Muslims or women, I’d have to go into a witness protection program. ” Watching the spectacle unfold, Clinton and her small army of a campaign team saw an opportunity. They would brand the whole GOP field as Trumpian. No matter who the Republicans nominate, they figured, Clinton was running against Trump. “They’re Trump without the pizzazz or the hair,” Clinton would come to say of the other Republicans. In Washington, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was grappling for ways to gain control of his party’s nominating process. His carefully laid plans to limit the number of debates and reorganize the calendar after 2012 were challenged by the size of the 2016 field.  “For me, it’s just 14 candidates, it’s having 14 actually   people running for president,” Priebus would later say, after three had dropped out. “Every analysis  —   the convention, the delegates, the debates, too many, not enough  —   it’s the number of candidates to manage and calculate that makes everything else complicated. ”  Even though Trump   party bosses in public, Priebus worked hard to develop a friendly personal rapport with Trump. After the Fox debate, Priebus sought to put the question about a   run to bed. He solicited signed pledges from all of the candidates vowing to support the eventual nominee. Most sent theirs back right away. For Trump, however, Priebus trekked up to New York to get the form in person. They met in the candidate’s Trump Tower office overlooking Central Park, where the billionaire signed the pledge and gave Priebus his assurances. For the rest of the year, speculation would continue off and on about Trump going rogue. But Priebus wouldn’t flinch. “I’ve never worried about him running as an independent,” he said in a December interview. “I am not one tiny, little bit worried about it. He’s not doing it. ”     BY NOW, THE TRUMP PHENOMENON was in full bloom. The candidate was reinventing political communication on the fly, calling in by telephone to cable programs day and night, and doing the same with Sunday morning talk shows, in contravention to the   practice of requiring guests at least to be in a remote studio with a camera. Cable television executives knew a hit series when they saw one.  The effect on other candidates was smothering. Walker said he quickly came to see that the focus on Trump kept him from breaking through. His policy rollouts, such as a prescription to overhaul the health care law, received scant media coverage. “I remember, one time, I went into a meeting and I came out 50 minutes later, and I won’t say what network it was, but it was one of the cable networks, still covering Trump’s speech live, 55 minutes later,” Walker recalled. “I don’t even think the president of the United States gets covered live for 55 minutes. ” Almost all the candidates were surprised at Trump’s continuing support. “We knew that voters were clearly angry at President Obama and wanted significant change in the White House,” said Bradshaw, the Bush adviser. “Trump is a talented candidate who channeled their anger effectively. . . . Have we been surprised by his staying power? Yes. But has it changed who Jeb is and his belief in the type of candidate we need? No. ” Beyond the rhetoric, everything about Trump’s campaign style drew more attention to the candidacy and perhaps nothing more so than the Boeing 757 that carried him from rally to rally. The plane carried   glamour along the campaign trail like no other competitor could. Trump invited journalists aboard for news conferences, or local politicians to put the squeeze on them for support. The cream leather chairs, with Trump’s crest woven into the headrests, hosted huddles with power brokers such as Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) and   dinners with his staff.  Trump, audaciously, landed his helicopter near the legendary Iowa State Fair in August. Just as Clinton was picking up her      sweaty   looked to the sky at the whirring sound of Trump’s helicopter approaching. A political Willy Wonka, sporting his red “Make America Great Again” cap, Trump offered kids rides on his helicopter. “Does anyone want to take a ride?” Trump asked them. “It’s nice, right?” Trump continued his penchant for theatrical displays. Ahead of a raucous   rally in Mobile, Ala. he directed his pilots to thunder flamboyantly over a college football stadium packed with supporters before touching down. This was the Deep South, the heart of red America, and the unlikely candidate from Queens wanted to own it. Bush’s super PAC tried to go    with Trump that day, renting a small airplane to fly over the stadium trailed by a banner that read, “TRUMP 4 TAXES. JEB 4 PREZ. ” Candidates playing by conventional rules, and with far fewer resources, found themselves at a huge disadvantage. By late summer, they began to fall away. The first was Perry, the Texan who had run again in part to prove he was a better candidate than he had been in 2012. He had done that, but he was hobbled  —   more so than he had calculated  —   by the debate sponsor’s decision to split the field into varsity and JV sessions and particularly by an indictment for misusing his office. “The indictment needed to go away and I needed to be on the main debate stage,” he said. “Neither one of those happened. ” In some ways, Perry became an object lesson for the folly of trying to attack Trump directly. But he also admitted to miscalculations about the state of the Republican electorate. “I’ve been mad at Washington longer than anybody out there  —   and doing something about it,” he said, pointing to his record as governor. But it was Trump  —   and, at that moment in early September, Carson and Fiorina  —   who were reaping the benefits of the   anger. “That’s my misjudgment,” Perry said. He added: “The electorate is really disgusted with Washington and the bullet goes through Washington and hits anybody that’s got any experience. They just lump us all into one. ” Perry’s departure came less than a week before the second debate, this one at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Backstage or between commercial breaks at the debates, the candidates were collegial with one another. Their personalities in that mix were revealing; one candidate would quip to Priebus that if the RNC really wanted to raise money it would sell    access to the green rooms.    Carly Fiorina meets New Hampshire voters at a spaghetti dinner in August 2015. She was propelled in polls for a few weeks after squaring off with Trump at the Reagan Library debate, but would not stay in the top tier for long. (Melina   Washington Post)  Fiorina and Paul were known to be more serious outliers among the group. Rubio came across to some as scripted and Cruz alternated between being a loner and a social butterfly. Kasich occasionally was moody, Christie gregarious and chatty, and Trump particularly charming, endlessly in search of praise. Heading into the Reagan Library debate, Trump knew his tussle with Fiorina might come up. A few days earlier, he was quoted in Rolling Stone magazine criticizing the appearance of her face: “Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? !” Backstage before the debate, according to a person who observed the candidates and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private encounter, “He was really trying to work her. ” It had little effect on Fiorina, who moments later would score one of her best applause lines with her steely retort to Trump. The debate propelled Fiorina in the polls for a few weeks, though she would not stay in the top tier for long. “There’s a myth about Donald,” the same person said. “He doesn’t like    confrontation. He likes going on Twitter and taking off at somebody. Or he’s in another room and you’re 5, 000 miles away and he bangs you. But when you’re    he doesn’t like it. He’s not comfortable with it. He wants to be liked, and you could tell that backstage. ” Standing next to Fiorina that night was Walker. For the Wisconsin governor, the debate was a critical opportunity. Over the summer, he had seen his lead in Iowa evaporate, eclipsed by both Trump and Carson. He was in single digits in the state most critical to his hopes of winning the nomination and his campaign was under pressure to reverse the trend. Through much of the evening, Walker was barely visible among the 11 candidates on the stage. After the debate, one of Walker’s sons made a telling observation. “Dad, you only got a couple questions because all the questions were about attacks on the other candidates,” Walker recalled his son saying. “He said, ‘You don’t attack any of the other Republicans; of course, you didn’t get any questions.’ ” Walker’s campaign was hobbled by more than the lack of visibility at the Reagan Library debate  —   mistakes by the candidate and what turned out to be profligate spending in the face of diminished resources. But like Perry, Walker found that experience in office and a record of taking on fights prized by conservatives provided little boost in the face of the appeals of pure outsiders: “I think because there’s frustration, voters have said we’re going to go as far removed from that, which again is why you had not only Trump but at least for a while you had Carly and Carson be a part of this wave of interest out there. ” Within a week of the Reagan Library debate, Walker abruptly suspended his campaign. The decision, he said, came down to answering the question of whether he could make changes that would alter the trajectory of his candidacy. “If we can’t change so that we get more attention, then we don’t have a pathway to the nomination,” he said. When Walker announced his suspension on Sept. 21, he said, “I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field. . . . I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same. ” None of the other candidates heeded Walker’s advice.  AUTUMN GAVE RISE to a few rivalries that would linger into the New Year. Leading up to the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. Bush and his team escalated their criticism of Rubio. At a   strategy briefing, Bush’s advisers presented to donors a slide show, part of which detailed Rubio’s perceived vulnerabilities. They had two  : Rubio has a lot of baggage and his relative inexperience relegated him to a “GOP Obama. ” On the campaign trail, Bush was zeroing in on Rubio’s voting record, noting that he had missed more votes than any of his colleagues. Bush suggested senators who miss their work should have their pay docked. His son, Jeb Jr. played the part of aggrieved constituent: “Dude, you know, either drop out or do something. ” In their debate preparations, Rubio and his advisers knew what to expect. The moment came 21 minutes into the debate. “Because I am a constituent of the senator,” Bush said, scolding his   disciple, “I expected that he would do constituent service, which means that he shows up to work. ”  Rubio counterpunched without missing a beat. “The only reason you are doing it now is because we are running for the same position, and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you. ”  In that instant, whatever air was left in Bush’s balloon seemed to fizzle out. Reporters in the spin room that night peppered campaign manager Danny Diaz with questions about whether Bush should quit the race. The Bush team continued to believe that if it could convey to voters the candidate’s record of successes and reforms in Florida, its candidate would eventually win their support. This had been the focus of the   super PAC’s fall advertising blitz. But to some voters, what had gotten through was not the Florida record but Trump’s incessant and unyielding mocking of Bush as “low energy. ” With fresh urgency, Bush headed to New Hampshire for a “Jeb Can Fix It” bus tour. He invited reporters onto his luxury coach, where Bush sat on a plush couch musing about his shortcomings. “I’ve learned to accept the simple fact that I’m imperfect under God’s watchful eye,” he said one night. “I don’t have a   problem, and I don’t have an   problem. . . . The adversity, I turn into opportunity. It’s an obstacle to jump over. It’s an opportunity to get better. ” Bush’s fall surprised some almost as much as Trump’s rise. “I expected Bush not only to have all the money, but also all the oxygen. ” Kasich said. “But he just didn’t. ”    Sen. Marco Rubio ( .) speaks at a town   meeting in Iowa in December 2015. Rubio has consistently tried to be a voice of dissent: “They’ve tried new people, they’ve tried old people and nothing changes. Things get worse. ” (Melina   Washington Post)  Rubio, meanwhile, who had struggled all summer to raise money and gain meaningful traction in the polls, seemed set to soar. Soon, donors would sign on and endorsements would roll in. Looking back, Rubio said, “I’m not a big believer in this one pivotal moment that decides the whole race. ” But if there were such a moment for him, the Boulder brawl was it. The candidate who made the most of the Boulder debate was not Rubio, however. It was Cruz. The debate was a freewheeling and chaotic affair, and the confrontational line of questioning from the CNBC moderators set the candidates on edge. Republican base voters famously scorn the mainstream media, and Cruz pounced on the opportunity to turn on the moderators.  “This is not a cage match,” Cruz thundered at the debate. “You look at the questions: ‘Donald Trump, are you a   villain?’ ‘Ben Carson, can you do math?’ ‘John Kasich, will you insult two people over here?’ ‘Marco Rubio, why don’t you resign?’ ‘Jeb Bush, why have your numbers fallen?’ ” The live audience at the University of Colorado roared in approval. And over on Fox News Channel, the meter on pollster Frank Luntz’s focus group nearly went off the charts. Luntz said on the air, “I’ve been doing this since 1996. This is a special moment. I’ve never tested in any primary debate a line that scored as well as this. ”  At the next debate, in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, Cruz would set his sights on Rubio. By the next morning, they had begun sparring over immigration policy, with each accusing the other of having once supported amnesty. Their squabbling would stretch into the new year. Other candidates were left to fume at what they perceived was coverage almost totally dictated by the latest poll  —   and not always a reliable poll. Paul was among those most exasperated. His rallies, he said, were still well attended. “The frustrating thing is the lack of appreciation of what we’ve done,” Paul said. “The simplicity of news coverage is astounding, where they’ll poll 300 to 400 people, and that defines the story. ”  AS FALL TURNED TO WINTER, outside events conspired to reshape the race. The terrorist attacks Nov. 13 in Paris and Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, Calif. spread fear across the country. More than anything, Republican voters were looking for strength. Carson became an immediate victim. The   surgeon hardly fit the profile of a wartime commander in chief. He stammered over foreign policy in interviews. His national security tutors leaked word that he didn’t know what he was talking about. And when Carson delivered a   speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, he repeatedly read “Hamas” in his speech notes and botched the name of the   movement, pronouncing it as the ground chickpea dish “hummus. ” Before Paris, Carson had started to surpass Trump in some Iowa and national polls, but with the shift to foreign affairs his poll numbers plummeted. He made a   effort to arrest his standing, touching down in Jordan just after Thanksgiving to tour two Syrian refugee camps on a   mission. But it did not have the desired effect. Frustrated, Carson gathered his advisers at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. to discuss repairing how he was perceived on foreign policy. The downbeat session stretched on for hours, with Carson complaining to aides that he was being portrayed as foolish. “Obviously, going through a process like this is pretty brutal,” Carson would later say. At the Dec. 15 debate in Las Vegas, he turned in another underwhelming performance. Soon, his campaign was engulfed in confusion and infighting. Carson didn’t know what to do to rescue his fleeting popularity with voters. He invited journalists from The Post and the Associated Press to his home two days before Christmas to signal a staff  . No one’s job was safe, he warned. “The key thing for me is just going to be not changing,” Carson said. “Everybody wants you to change. They say, ‘If you do this, it’ll be better.’ But that’s what politicians do. That’s what they try to do in order to get elected. I’m not trying to change in order to get elected. ” On the last day of the year, campaign manager Bennett and other top officials resigned from the Carson campaign. The Paris and San Bernardino attacks persuaded other candidates that a shift to    issues of national security would expose Trump as unworldly and unknowledgeable. But once again, he defied the norms of politics. The policy pronouncement came over by email on Dec. 7, Pearl Harbor Day, at 4:16 p. m.: “Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration. ” Trump called for a “total and complete” ban on Muslims entering the United States, at least temporarily. His statement cited research that he said showed that large segments of the world’s   religion were rooted in hatred and violence. The proposal defied a call for tolerance toward Muslims that President Obama issued less than 24 hours earlier from the Oval Office. It drew condemnations from leaders around the globe as well as his rival candidates. “Donald Trump is unhinged,” Bush tweeted. Finally, Trump had crossed a bridge too far. Or so went the instant analysis  —   once again. But that night in South Carolina, campaigning aboard the USS Yorktown, Trump defiantly read his proposal. Banning Muslims was “common sense,” he said. “We have no choice. We have no choice. ” His crowd rose to its feet. There were cheers and hoots and loud applause. In the days to come, Trump’s poll numbers climbed higher still. Republican primary voters, it turned out, liked what he had to say. The Muslim comment seemed to spur Bush to action. In the year’s final debate, he confronted Trump more vigorously than ever, delivering a performance that seemed to rejuvenate him. He continued to carry the attacks on Trump through the rest of the year with the hope that in the   world of the Republican race, no one was truly out of the running. “This is not something that is new,” adviser Bradshaw said of Bush’s aggression. “Trump’s comments keep getting more outrageous. He felt it was incumbent on him to push back. He [Trump] is not our path to the White House. ” Bush told CBS’s John Dickerson in late December that he had “hated” being the   and now felt unleashed to run freely. “It is a little liberating to be able to post up against a guy who is not qualified to be president,” he said. Bush’s candidacy now stood for something else, however, which was the epic failure of super PAC dollars to change the dynamic of the Republican race in 2015. Right to Rise, Bush’s super PAC, spent tens of millions of dollars through the fall and early winter months while Bush’s poll numbers continued to sag. But no other candidate’s super PAC was having any real success, either. On New Year’s Eve, Trump took to Twitter to observe: “. @JebBush has spent $63, 000, 000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!” No final verdict was possible on the power of the super PAC until the voters were heard from in 2016, but in 2015 they were the dogs that didn’t bark.    New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie leans in to shake supporters’ hands after announcing his candidacy for president in June 2015 at a high school in his state. At the last debate of the year, he called President Obama a “feckless weakling. ” (Brendan  )  Trump wasn’t the only presidential hopeful trying to exude strength after San Bernardino. For Christie, who had toiled for months in relative obscurity searching from one New Hampshire town hall meeting to next for a comeback, terrorism became his lucky strike. Suddenly, the tough,   former prosecutor from New Jersey was a hot draw. At town   meetings stretching two hours long, grown men and women were reduced to tears as Christie talked about the five hours on Sept. 11, 2001, when he didn’t know if his wife, Mary Pat, who worked in Lower Manhattan, had died with the fall of the Twin Towers. Christie also stressed that, as a former U. S. attorney in New Jersey who dealt with issues of terrorism after   his credentials stood alone. Sitting down for an interview one chilly December night in Wolfeboro, N. H. Christie said: “I personally know all the tools that are available and have used them. No one else on that stage has done that. They’ve just heard about it from other people. It’s the difference between playing in a sport and being a spectator. ”     BY YEAR’S END, THERE WAS a palpable sense of unease about the future  —   fear of possible terrorist attacks, distrust of institutions and political leaders, economic anxieties amid the recovery and lower unemployment, and confusion about what verdict the voters would deliver in November. Analysts looked for parallels for the year just ended. Was this like 1992, a year of anger at government when a   candidate by the name of Ross Perot captured nearly a fifth of the national vote? Or 1948, with two   nominees and independent candidates from the left and right? Or the period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the racially based rhetoric of George Wallace struck a populist chord? Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who advises a   super PAC, said: “I think it’s unique to our times. It’s very much a product of the economic moment, this combination of a world of  ’s United [the Supreme Court case that helped give rise to super PACs] and   Recession. . . . I definitely think what we’re going through now is deeper and darker than anything we’ve gone through in our politics for a long time. ” The Democratic nomination contest still falls along more conventional lines, with a strong   in Clinton backed heavily by the establishment and an insurgent challenger in Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) powered by an energized progressive base. The real turmoil is inside the Republican Party, now clearly split and heading for a potentially decisive clash between its warring factions. Whatever lies ahead, the assumptions candidates and their strategists carried with them as the year began were mostly blown apart by what happened, including the possibility that Trump could become the Republican nominee. Among Trump supporters, there is a belief that the political class doesn’t know what’s coming. Party leaders still heavily discount that possibility, but they no longer rule it out. “I’m not one of these people that think that Donald Trump can’t win a general election,” said Priebus, the RNC chair. “I actually think there is a huge crossover appeal there to people that are disengaged politically that he speaks to. . . . Donald Trump taps into the culture. Some people in politics don’t get it, don’t understand it, are frustrated by it. It doesn’t matter. He does. ” The struggles of the establishment candidates to slow down Trump and Cruz, who by year’s end was surging in Iowa, led some party figures to think about a saving grace. In late December in Boston, Romney said he still encounters Republicans trying to draft him. “Every day I get a call or letters,” he said. “I go to church, I get harangued at church. ‘Oh, you’ve got to run!’ ” “Look,” Romney added, “I had one person who was running for president, and I won’t give you the name . . . called me and said, ‘I hope you don’t close the door. We may need you.’ That’s a person running for president. A candidate. A Republican. I’m not giving it a second thought. ” One other thing has changed: At the time Trump entered the race and began to defy the conventional rules of past campaigns, there was a sense in the camps of some of his rivals that he had created an alternate universe that ran parallel to the more traditional path of politics. It was there to observe but not necessarily understand or manage. Now many have come to see that they all are operating inside that alternate universe. They are trying to adapt as best they can. Rubio’s rhetoric is edgier than it was before. Christie has used    language to attack Congress and especially Obama, whom he described as a “feckless weakling” at the last debate of the year. For someone like Cruz, a terrain defined by anger is a welcome development. His campaign was shaped from the moment he arrived in Washington as one that would find its most fertile ground among those most disaffected with the elites and the Washington establishment. “I’m a big believer in politics that truth will out,” Cruz said. “You run as who you are. Indeed, the candidates who often tend to do the worst are those who can’t figure out who they are and who run one day as a conservative and one day as a moderate and end up getting the support of neither. ” For someone like Rubio, the environment has presented unexpected challenges. How does a candidate who built his campaign around a positive and hopeful message navigate a campaign in which fear and anger have become the guiding emotions? Asked why he believed his approach could win the day in such an environment, Rubio said, “We are a hopeful and optimistic people and we have a lot to be optimistic about if we do what needs to be done. So I would say my campaign is realistic but optimistic. ” But he went on to say this: “I recognize people’s frustration and you’ve got to speak to that. If they don’t believe you’re in touch with what they’re feeling in their lives, there’s no way they’re going to make you president. ”    Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, left, answers a question as former Texas governor Rick Perry listens in August 2015 at a debate for   Republican presidential candidates. Both have exited the race. (Brian  )  By the time 2015 closed, more candidates had quit the race. Jindal exited in   and Graham and Pataki followed him in December. When he quit, Jindal noted how the environment favored someone like Trump over more traditional candidates. Saying he had tried to offer policy ideas to the voters, he told Fox News anchor Baier, “Given this crazy, unpredictable election season, clearly there wasn’t an interest in those policy papers. ” Candidates far down in the polls hold out hope that the voters will prove to be unpredictable, as ever. “When people ask that question about surprise, they assume we know something about the election,” Paul said. “We haven’t had an election. We have polls and things, but I don’t think we’ll know anything until the voting begins. ” As Kasich said, 2016 “could be a year where things could be absolutely normal because right now they appear abnormal. There’s no voting yet. ”  Santorum said Trump’s suffocating presence has slowed the normal rhythms of the campaign, in which candidates rise, are exposed to scrutiny and either prosper or lose altitude. “It’s more incremental,” he said. “They’re not getting the attention that leads to a higher spike and leads to a faster decline. Trump has been a depressant factor on this rise and fall, and it’s stretched it out. ”  Santorum has been kept in the shadows, but is he frustrated? “Four years ago, I was more frustrated than I am now,” he said. “I actually understand this. I understand the fixation [with Trump]. I get that. What I’m waiting to see  —   and this is the valuable role Iowa plays in the process  —   is whether Iowans who go to caucuses are going to continue on this trek; or are they going to take a step back and say, ‘We’re going to regress to the norm?’ ” As Election Year begins, the answer to that question seems no more predictable than it was last June 16.  Dec.   2015  It’s the week after Christmas and the first contests are little more than a month away. In Iowa and New Hampshire, voters brave nasty snow and difficult roads to question the candidates.   Chris Christie is in Muscatine, Iowa, and goes straight for the serious stuff. Terrorism. ISIS. That shooting at a center for the developmentally disabled in San Bernardino? It could happen anywhere  —   and though he doesn’t say Muscatine, everyone knows that’s what he means. Marco Rubio is 70 miles up the road in Clinton, an aptly named starting point for his “Out With the Old, In With the New” tour of Iowa. The country is heading toward ruin, and this hopeful son of immigrants wants to save it.   Ted Cruz is taking a break from Iowa, but he will be back soon enough. Cruz spends the final days of the year at a sprawling Texas ranch huddling with evangelical leaders, some 300 of them. He began 2015 as the candidate of the tea party. Now he is the candidate of evangelicals, too. But Mike Huckabee isn’t letting it go without a fight. The forgotten victor of eight years past is making plans to camp out in Iowa throughout January, some 150 events. He wants to be remembered again. So, too, does Rick Santorum, Iowa’s 2012 winner.   Jeb Bush has a plan to bounce back. He is at a smokehouse in South Carolina today, again attacking the man  —   a cartoon character, in Bush’s mind  —   who replaced him as the  . But he is haunted once more by the legacy of his brother. When he playfully nicknames the    state senator endorsing him “Hurricane Katrina,” his listeners cringe.   Donald Trump begins the week in New Hampshire. Snow is coming overnight but the gymnasium at the Pennichuck Middle School in Nashua is filled to capacity. Trump delivers an   speech, punctuated by chants from the audience: “U. S. A.! U. S. A.! U. S. A. !”   As he closes, Trump tells of a call he says he received from a reporter, a prominent reporter, he says, without offering a name. He says the reporter has told him, “What you’ve done nobody has ever, ever done. . . . You’ve changed politics as we know it. ” Trump likes the sound of that, but he knows better. He offers a parting thought  —   a reminder that all up to now is merely prelude. “Honestly,” he says, “unless I win, it doesn’t mean a damn thing to me. ”   David Weigel contributed to this report.

"  p. series b. series img. series   About this series: What’s happening in America? What does it mean to be an American? These are questions defining a campaign unlike any other. For nearly 35 days, we crossed the nation looking for answers. This is what we found. PART 1 | PART 2 | PART 3 | PART 4       Where else to pick up but in Las Vegas, our nation’s great national cliche, more excessive in its hyperbole than the boasts in a Donald Trump stump speech, at once the representation and perversion of the American Dream. It is by its very sustenance a city teeming with losers, yet the tallest residential structure in town has Trump’s name on it. People flock here in hopes of something gained, of some miraculous transfer of wealth, of beating or evening the odds rigged against them, of leaving inhibitions behind, in fear and loathing, in remembrance of things lost. All various ways of interpreting what the 2016 presidential campaign is about. It was 45 years ago that gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson beat his way to Las Vegas, longing for something already gone, a time when “there was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. ” He was writing in 1971 about the heady counterculture days of the  ’60s, although the words could be appropriated by various ideologies this election year. Feeling out of time, his senses altered by hallucinogenic drugs, Thompson rendered a novelistic evocation of Las Vegas as the wasteland of the righteous capitalist ideal. One can only wonder what Thompson would have done with the materialization of candidate Trump. Watching the Republican Party leadership deal with Trump, one person said, was like witnessing a   Vegas act  —   the illusionist David Blaine trying to escape from a water tank. Surely he will loosen his way out from the chains and handcuffs and rise to safety. Time passes, even in this city without clocks, and is it already too late? How much longer can he hold his breath? The establishment was in the water tank, running out of air. The Trump International Hotel Las Vegas is understated compared with the man himself, and in contrast to the neon madness nearby. The owner might call it   if it were Jeb Bush’s joint, not his. A block off the metastasizing gaudiness of the Strip, it has no casinos, no   slot machines dinging and clanging, no motley hordes marauding over the vast carpeted expanses in search of a magic show or a buffet line. Inside the   doors, in the clean, bright restaurant off the lobby, Mary Robinson sat enjoying breakfast. It was only by chance that Robinson had spent the night at this hotel. She had arrived from Georgia earlier than her friends, and her travel agent booked her there for a night before moving her to the Encore casino hotel on the Strip. “You’re not really going to stay at Trump’s?” one friend chided her upon hearing the news.    Supporters of Hillary Clinton listen as their candidate speaks at an outdoor rally in Las Vegas on Feb. 19, the eve of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. The former secretary of state was accompanied by her husband, Bill Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea Clinton. (Melina   Washington Post)  As a    African American, an IBM retiree and a staunch Democrat, Robinson expressed shock about Trump’s success and concern as to what it meant. She worried that the Trump movement was fueled at least in part by racism, an angry backlash to the presidency of Barack Obama and the changing demographics of the country. She confessed to having felt compelled to “defriend” some people on Facebook who were supporting Trump and defining what it means to be an American in ways that were disturbing to her. “I posed this question to some of these Facebook friends: What would be one thing that would change if you ‘got your country back’?” Robinson said. “And by the way, who stole it? Would you take it back to the 1950s, when blacks faced segregation laws? When white men controlled everything? Is that the country you want back?” Did she have any empathy for white men who felt betrayed or left behind by the powers that be? This was as foreign to her as that possible new planet past Pluto. “No,” Robinson said, and then she added, slowly enunciating every word to emphasize the point: “I don’t get that whole thing about them being screwed. When you are brought up black, in the South, that is a leap I just cannot make. ” One of the   people who helped feed tourists such as Mary Robinson was    Alma Zamarin, a petite,   food service worker who grew up in the Philippines and “jumped ship” more than 20 years ago after marrying an American. She was now a citizen, and she also happened to be a committee leader in the employee group at the hotel that organized under the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 banner. She is no fan of Trump and his followers. The Trump management was challenging the union election, but the vote seemed likely to hold. For the man who promises that as president that he would win so much that the public would grow tired of it and beg him to lose just to break the monotony, here was one for the loss column.    Alma Zamarin, a Filipina food service worker at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, is pictured on Feb. 20. Zamarin is a member of the Culinary Workers Union trying to bargain with owner Donald Trump. (Linda   Washington Post)  Zamarin is part of the other Las Vegas, the real city, largely   and with a predominance of Hispanics, along with blacks and Asians, and strongly  . In the power structure of Nevada, the culinary workers play a vital and uncommon role. They make this casino wonderland possible, serving the food, washing the dishes, cleaning the rooms, carrying the luggage, parking the cars. Their strength comes not through money but because of the necessity of the work and the magnitude of their numbers. And they know how to organize, both to win contracts and affect elections. This side of Las Vegas was on display when Zamarin walked a picket line in the   dusk on the sidewalk perimeter of Sunrise Hospital along with several hundred others. The mass demonstration involved a dispute with Sunrise’s parent company, the Hospital Corporation of America, a giant   hospital conglomerate, over higher rates the hospital wanted to charge union members in its health network. This was not a campaign event, and yet it was, falling under the rubric of the little guys saying they were being squeezed by corporate greed. What does it mean to be a culinary worker in America? The chants resounded up and down the line.  Who sucks?   Sunrise sucks!  The picketers were barely 20 minutes into their demonstration when a caravan of dark SUVs pulled to the curb. Out flew Secret Service agents and a covey of aides, all unavoidably inflated with the     of   campaigning, and then from behind the tinted glass came Hillary Clinton. She was perfectly put together, ready for another go at a town hall showdown with Bernie Sanders, as she made her way along the curb and down the line.    Members of the Culinary Workers Union picket outside Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas on Feb. 18 to protest what they say are stall tactics on negotiating contracts with the Hospital Corporation of America, its parent company. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders stopped by the demonstration to talk to members two days ahead of the Nevada Democratic caucuses. (Linda   Washington Post)  The chanting continued unabated.  Who sucks? Sunrise sucks!  The candidate was shaking hands and offering encouragement.  You’ve got a good protest going on here.   Keep the pressure on.   Good for you. All right! All right!  She stopped to pose for photos with workers. And soon enough, she was gone. Twenty minutes later, another caravan pulled to the curb, with another rush of agents and aides, and another candidate working the line. “I’ve been Bernified!” one union steward yelped joyously after Sanders gave her an embrace. If you are looking for the issues of modern America, they are all here in abundance, like everything in Las Vegas. During the last recession, this place became known as the foreclosure capital of the country. The jobless rate and homeless problem grew accordingly, and they are still evident. The schools are stressed. The population has swelled with Mexican and Central American immigrants, legal and not. Poor mental health is a problem, with a suicide rate well above the national norm. The desert environment is endangered. Water is always the question: how to get it, how to preserve it. And if you are looking for quirky American stories, they are here in abundance, too. Consider first the case of Justin Lepper, an artist with his own studio, who studied political science at Indiana University and worked on election law for George W. Bush’s reelection campaign in 2004. On a day just before the caucuses, he was curating an exhibit of paintings of Sanders that would be auctioned off that night. Lepper had painted a few of them himself, including one of Sanders dressed as his hokey namesake, KFC’s Colonel Sanders, with double vision.    Artist Justin Lepper puts the finishing touches on a painting of Bernie Sanders at the Eden Art Studio and Gallery in Las Vegas on Feb. 18. Lepper was curating an exhibit of artwork of Sanders to be auctioned off at a fundraiser for the candidate ahead of the state’s Democratic caucuses. Although Lepper likes Sanders, he said he didn’t plan to vote. (Linda   Washington Post)  From Bush to Bernie? Lepper called himself “the world’s most liberal conservative. ”   supportive of gay rights,   (although he doesn’t own one) a “capitalist at heart” who had a marriage fall apart and a house out near Centennial Hills get foreclosed on. He thought he was living the American Dream, and now he had reinvented himself with a new one, like so many people out here. He called the     painting “I Love Chicken. ” “Chicken is very American. Colonel Sanders is very American. Bernie Sanders is very American. Fighting for the American middle class. ” Something else was very American, as it turned out. Although he considered Sanders “the best choice we have this year,” Lepper will not vote for him. He does not plan to vote at all. Just like 43 percent of the registered voters in 2012. It is always instructive to remember this aspect of American democracy: Voting is a right people died for; choosing not to vote is a freedom. Melissa Petersen, a leading arts advocate in the city, was not only planning to vote, she was the Democratic Party’s site leader for the five neighborhood precincts that would caucus at the John C. Fremont Middle School. Petersen was a Las Vegas native who knew the neighborhoods block by block  —   where the Bernie signs were, where the “corn man” and the “tamale lady” might situate their carts, where the other colonel, Elvis’s Col. Parker, kept his ostentatious residence, where the voters who might need a   interpreter lived. It was the diversity of the city, she said, that explained what it meant to be an American. She was a liberal, supportive of undocumented immigrants and gay rights, worried about climate change, but she said most of her relatives lived out in the gated communities and would vote for Trump.   * * *    A supporter waits for Donald Trump to arrive at a campaign event in Walterboro, S. C. on Feb. 17. (Jabin   Washington Post)  Across the nation, in Columbia, S. C. a member of Marco Rubio’s staff had just beckoned Steven Diaz, 31, a stocky former Marine with a “#marcomentum” button affixed to his pullover, to stand in front of a black curtain that protected a hotel bathroom and hallway that served as a makeshift green room for the candidate and his aides. Diaz stood there, folding his arms across his broad chest. “There’s another bathroom around the corner,” he told each person trying to get behind the curtain. As one scooted away, Diaz smirked. “I actually don’t know if there’s a bathroom that way,” he said. “People just follow me. They think I’m intimidating because I have no eye. ” His left eye resembled a marble. A scar on his right side stretched across his skull like the lines of a basketball. It had been more than 20 years since his family moved from Mexico, 13 years since he became a Marine and 10 years since he was hit by an IED in Iraq’s Anbar province. The shrapnel went through his left eye and into his right brain, affecting his   memory and causing doctors to replace a part of his skull with plastic. It had been eight years since he had come home and faced depression, five years since his marriage and four years since he said he finally understood what love really meant. Four months since he began volunteering for Rubio. He was just proud to be serving again. “When you come back, you realize that when you’re away the politicians have control over so much,” Diaz said. “A part of you knows you’re being used as a pawn. But you focus on protecting people and helping out kids or building roads, and that’s what we have to focus on. Because if you try to understand the politics, whew. ” The 2016 campaign offered opportunity and confusion for Diaz and many veterans like him. The military molded him not to question the commander in chief. But the country he fought for was waging a fierce internecine battle. In his conservative, evangelical circle, things had changed. No one there seemed to think President Obama was utilizing the talents of troops abroad or respecting veterans at home. The questions unsettled the fundamental fabric of South Carolina, a state that prided itself as being the most patriotic in the country. Spending cuts were diminishing communities whose economic vitality relied on the   complex. They were polarized, angry and struggling. Was the American promise still real? Or had it become as seductive and improbable as a slot machine in Vegas?     Steven Diaz, 31, a medically retired Marine veteran who runs Hidden Wounds, a nonprofit organization in Columbia, S. C. that helps veterans deal with the emotional scars of war, is pictured on Feb. 24. Diaz was wounded by an improvised explosive device in Iraq, losing vision in his left eye. He suffered traumatic brain injury and   stress disorder. Diaz said he would vote for Marco Rubio in the South Carolina primary. (Linda   Washington Post)  And then there was Diaz, a patriot in a country that felt less patriotic. Diaz was critical of Obama but tried to find a balance between being open about his personal struggles and avoiding needless bickering. If South Carolina would do the same, he hoped the answer would lie with Rubio. He was drawn to the senator’s optimism and his multiethnic group of conservatives. Rubio’s father had moved the family to the United States when Marco was 4 to be the pastor of Iglesia Latina de Columbia, and now Diaz relished the idea of a Hispanic president. It also meant something to Diaz that Rubio thanked veterans at each campaign stop.   wore baseball caps with their military branch embroidered on them, but his generation tended to wear subtle black wristbands, often with the names of a friend who lost his life during the war. The last time he was at a campaign rally, and Rubio asked vets to raise their hands to be acknowledged, Diaz made friends. One of them was Michael Banks, a    Air Force vet who had started a martial arts studio in town. “There’s a lot of piss and moan going on right now,” Banks said in a conversation with Diaz. “But there is still a lot of opportunity in this country. ” “Yeah, when you spend days sleeping in holes, and seeing people who want to destroy your freedoms, it changes things,” Diaz replied. “What I loved about the military was that there was no division. In the bigger perspective, we were all willing to kill for each other and die for each other. Now, in the civilian world, everyone wants you to pick a side. ” After he was injured, Diaz oscillated between anger and guilt. It anguished him when he heard about friends in the war zones getting hurt because he thought he should have been with them. It angered him whenever Obama withdrew troops from Iraq or Afghanistan before the countries were stable, thinking it risked everything for which they had fought. His return meant dealing with the VA bureaucracy while attempting to cope with   stress disorder and seizures. He tried to stay positive while he watched friends sink into depression and alcoholism. After a good friend committed suicide, Diaz   Hidden Wounds, a nonprofit organization that connected veterans with therapists and private doctors as they waited for an appointment at the VA hospital  —   which he said could take up to six months. About 2, 000 veterans, mostly from South Carolina, had taken advantage of the program, and the group footed the bill for 500 of them.    Steven Diaz suffered from a traumatic brain injury while serving as a Marine, and he sees veterans’ care as one of the top issues in the presidential election. (Jayne Orenstein, Dalton   Washington Post)   When Mario Rubio, Marco’s    brother and a former Green Beret, came to town, a staffer asked Diaz to organize a dinner with him and other vets. Diaz put on a blazer and found an American flag to commemorate the event. Diaz sat down at Lizard’s Thicket with his wife, Laura Diaz. She was the daughter of a    mom and a truck driver who saw his wages stagnate, then decrease until he was eventually laid off. Her mother had to reenter the workforce in her 60s but found little luck applying for jobs against underemployed college graduates. “We plunged from   to poor,” Laura Diaz said. “I’m not sure how we’re gonna get back. ” Joining them was Jesus Caldera, a      with gelled hair and rimless glasses, who had to drop out of the University of South Carolina after administrators asked students for proof of citizenship. Caldera had none. His parents had immigrated illegally from Venezuela when he was an infant, and he grew up with Steven Diaz in the evangelical church. Although he was as conservative as his friends, Caldera found a reason to thank Obama for giving him “the biggest break in my life” when the president issued an executive order allowing “dreamers” like him to get driver’s licenses and work permits. He now managed a   call center at the United Way and was drawn to Rubio because of his work on immigration reform. “I know he has to distance himself from it now,” Caldera said, “but I remember what he did. I know he’ll look out for people like me when he’s in office. ” As they began to dig into dishes of fried catfish and green beans and okra, Laura Diaz confessed that she was afraid they would have offended somebody by simply bringing an American flag to the restaurant. This is the fear that political correctness had wrought after a tumultuous summer in South Carolina. They marveled at how quickly their state supported the families of the Emanuel Nine, the black churchgoers who were killed by a young white gunman, but found themselves exhausted at the subsequent controversy over the Confederate flag. “It just seemed like it wasn’t causing any trouble being up there,” Laura Diaz said to the table. “But then, people just used the moment for their own agenda. ” “Does it ever feel to you like we are going back a generation?” Steven Diaz asked. “With Black Lives Matter and all this aggression, sometimes it feels like we have forgotten how far we’ve come. “I mean, there was a time we could not eat with these people,” Diaz said to Cal dera. He looked at his wife, a white woman from Mississippi. Mario Rubio, whose struggles with the VA bureaucracy are invoked in his brother’s stump speech, approached Diaz’s table and patted the young veteran on his back. “How’s the VA treating you?” he asked. “Well, I’ve learned how to play the game,” Diaz said. “No, let me rephrase: I’ve learned how to work with the system. ” Rubio laughed and said, “Can you teach me?”    Walter Holm, 67, a Vietnam War veteran living at Transitions, a homeless recovery center in Columbia, S. C. is pictured on Feb. 22. He served in the Marines; has no drug, alcohol or mental problems; has had four years of college; and had been employed most of his life until medical problems caused him to lose almost everything. He spends his days at an unemployment center and a public library, where he applies for jobs online. (Linda   Washington Post)  If Walter Holm, a    Vietnam War vet, could teach young Americans a lesson about the country, he said it would be that the place was “hallowed ground, brimming with opportunity. ” Yet he couldn’t find any. At the unemployment office near downtown Columbia on another day, Holm walked out of the place feeling frustrated, again. Holm spent his childhood in rural Rhode Island, worked as a commercial diver in New York, designed cabinets in California and built houses in Alaska. He said he lost all his money paying for operations on his back and his digestive system and moved to Columbia to find building work after last fall’s floods. “I always thought by this age I would retire and feel good, but this is a little depressing,” he said. Then he paused, looked to the sun and added: “I’m homeless. ” He wore glasses and hid his thin white hair under a   veteran’s cap, trying not to worry. As the Republican primary approached, he focused instead on the condition of the nation, which he thought was in the midst of its own crisis. “We used to be a country that valued integrity, that meant what we said. ” He watched Obama with confusion after the president did not fully back Syrian rebels against a ruler who allegedly used chemical weapons. He wondered why Obama did not keep a larger sustained presence in Iraq, instead of “using the military like little specks at a time, instead of using our firepower. ” Holm was not registered to vote in South Carolina, but he said he would vote for Ted Cruz if he could. He liked that the senator from Texas was willing to shut down the government to voice his disdain for Obamacare and Planned Parenthood funding. Although he opted against Trump out of fear that he would be too eager to use his war powers “as a showmanship thing,” he appreciated that the New York billionaire pounded away against illegal immigration. Every morning, Holm sees groups of   men huddled on a street corner, waiting to get picked up for   jobs. Holm acknowledged that he was old and could not move as fast as any of them, but he figured he could at least supervise. In the meantime, he would fill out 10 to 30 applications a day sitting in the local library or McDonald’s. The only job he was offered paid $8 an hour, which he thought was too little.  * * *    Journalism major Nikeeya Ali, 19, walks to class at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, S. C. on Feb. 25. (Linda   Washington Post)   At South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, Nikeeya Ali’s goal for this election season was to stay “woke. ” That meant being aware of the injustices of institutional racism and countering efforts to demean black culture. It was part of the political awakening among young black activists in America, and it was disrupting the otherwise cozy relationship the Clintons had with African Americans. Ali was friendly and curious, a    sophomore class president, and she had just learned about the 1994 crime bill’s disproportionate effects on black men. It was a measure that Hillary Clinton had supported as first lady. The morning after learning about the crime bill, Ali was in the audience when actress Angela Bassett came to the historically black public college to stump for Clinton. Ali approached the microphone. “I just want to say your outfit is amazing,” she started. Then she said her professor had played a video in which Clinton talked about how black men could seem scary when they wore hoodies. “As a black woman with two sons, why do you really advocate on Ms. Clinton’s behalf?” Bassett, who actually has only one son, stumbled briefly before saying Clinton was ready to have conversations and “put in place a concrete plan. ” Ali couldn’t remember that part. She was too thrilled, too nervous. She wrote about the experience on a personal blog and watched with amazement as it received about 43, 000 page views. Intellectuals including Cornel West,   Coates and Michelle Alexander had abandoned the Clintons. And just as a segment of white America was defying conventional Republican dogma and going for Trump, Ali and her friends were debating whether they, too, had too much faith in a politician who seemed to pander. Given the string of unarmed black men being shot by police, and the battle over the Confederate flag, Ali and her friends could not help but be woke. Those incidents were discussed so much on campus that faculty put on a seminar called “How to Not Get Killed by the Police. ” “I have two brothers, and it bears on my soul every day,” Ali said. “It’s always in the back of my head that something might happen to them. He might not even have to open his mouth  —   just by the color of his skin. I want a politician who will address that and mean it. ”    South Carolina State University student Nikeeyah Ali doesn’t see a divided United States, but rather one that has been brought closer together because of social media. (Jayne Orenstein, Dalton   Washington Post)   After writing her blog post, Ali took increasing pride in being part of the new black consciousness. There was a history of activism at the school. In 1968, students began protesting a segregated bowling alley in Orangeburg, and after an officer was hit with an object during a campus protest, police fired into the crowd. They wounded 27 and killed three. The Orangeburg Massacre predated similar incidents at Kent State and Jackson State, but it was underplayed by newspapers covering civil rights in the South. Now the campus had a bowling alley of its own but struggled with declining enrollment and state funding. Broken windows. A vacant dorm. A shuttered Starbucks. But the roadshow of American media was about to clang into town. Clinton was coming to the school. Ali had concerns about inconsistencies in Clinton’s story. Not that she was certain about Sanders. Some of his ideas seemed impractical, and his notion of providing free tuition at public universities, she thought, might harm enrollment and funding at historically black colleges. Two days before Clinton arrived, Ali and her friends spoke about how proud they were that Beyoncé took on a political cause with her video “Formation,” and rejoiced at how unapologetically black Kendrick Lamar’s performance was at the Grammys, where he came out in a prison uniform while his band played in jail cells before being released to joyfully step with dancers in African garb. The word they used was “authentic. ” It was not a word they would use with Clinton. Khadeja Ceasar, a    majoring in political science who grew up in Sumter and dyed her afro puff in a color somewhere between brown and green, declared that Clinton could not construct an actual policy argument to help black people. “I’m personally excited to see her,” said Nakea Pennant, 19, a biology major. “She’s the one who can get the job done. She has years of experience. ” The others at the table stared at her. “What? You have an issue? Chime in. ” Ali jumped in. “I saw her on video singing ‘His Eye Is on the Sparrow,’ because she was speaking to some black people,” Ali said, referencing a familiar song in the black church. “Now, you know she doesn’t sing that song to herself. Who taught her that?” “But that’s how politics are played,” Pennant said. Their generation was promised a new type of politics that they believe never fully came. Most were tweens and teenagers when Obama won and remember their parents and teachers crying at that unlikely moment. As they grew older, they all knew Obama would not solve racism in America. He was one man. But they did not expect to come of age at a time when perceived injustice would lead to looting in Ferguson, Mo. and rioting in Baltimore, and a Republican   singling out Mexican immigrants as “rapists. ”    Jalen Griffin kills time before a game at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, S. C. on Feb. 25. Griffin said he had no plans to vote in the presidential primary. (Linda   Washington Post)  “If Trump wins, America is a country that is willing to accept racism,” Ali said. “And if Hillary wins, it makes us know we’re moving in a direction of diversity. ” “If he wins, now we know they hate us,” said Keith Gilliard, 27, a broadcast major who was invited by Sanders’s staff to perform his rap song “I Love My HBCU” on the candidate’s tour of historically black colleges and universities. The conversation sped up. Although they appreciated Obama’s legacy, one student noted that few of the people who had most powerfully worked for change in the black community did so inside the electoral system. They were people such as Malcolm and Martin, who exacted pressure on a system that did not present solutions quickly enough. “Things are going to get worse, but it’s getting better because we are getting people to listen,” Ali said. “You can’t ignore Beyoncé, you can’t ignore Kendrick Lamar, because black people are becoming more serious about our state in society. So many people are becoming, like, woke. ” “Now we have the power of the people,” said Raven Barker, a    broadcasting major known to his friends as Jim West, his   name. “By the time we hit our 30s and 40s, we’re going to be the ones that are leading the line and we will have the power to control the conversation. ” “I think the old people have already accepted ‘This is my life,’  ” said Deja Wilson, 19, who was studying criminal justice and planned a career as a police officer and then a prosecutor. “They are like, ‘I raised you, I gave you the information [about racism] I bust my ass every day, I make sure that there was food on your table, why do I have to be rioting for you?’ ” The students were asked whether they had any talks with white people about race relations. They were told stories from Iowa about how many people there thought Obama spoke too much about race, fostering even more division. “Are they trolling?” one student asked. “I would assume they are looking for a laugh. ” “Do they not watch the news every day?” another asked. “I would have sympathy for them, but I would feel sorry about their mental state. ” With the election approaching, Ali was about to make up her mind. Her friends had shared a video of a protester who bought a ticket to a private Clinton fundraiser in Charleston. The woman hoisted what appeared to be a pillowcase that said “We have to bring them to heel. ” It was a reference to a Clinton quote in which she discussed the importance of tougher prison sentences for “ . ” It seemed she was talking about young black men. “Will you apologize to black people for mass incarceration?” the protester asked. Clinton tried to answer, but the woman continued talking. As she was escorted out, Clinton told the audience, “Back to the issues. ” The video horrified Ali. Back to the issues? Clinton’s support of the crime bill was the issue. By the next afternoon, Ali was wearing a “Bernie Sanders”   as she looked out a window and saw a long line forming to see Clinton. The melody of “Lift Every Voice and Sing’’ could be heard ringing out from the campus bell tower.  * * *    Leo Murietta and his family were homeless after immigrating to the United States from Mexico, but his parents found jobs working in the Las Vegas casinos. He sees immigration reform as a top issue for this election but also is optimistic that progress can be made. (Alice Li, Jayne   Washington Post)    When at last it was all over in South Carolina and Nevada, and Clinton had won each, Nevada narrowly and South Carolina overwhelmingly, and Trump had cleaned his opponents’ clocks in both states, Melissa Petersen would sit in the back yard of her home on Barbara Street in Las Vegas and listen to the shrieks coming from atop the Stratosphere, a giant observation tower that rises high above her Beverly Green neighborhood. She knew the screams by heart  —   three variations that differentiated the amusement rides that provoked them, from the mechanical claw to the bungee jump to the capsule shot up and down. Las Vegas again capturing the American mood. There was the hysterical giggling scream. There was the scream of utter terror. And there was the undulating scream that started   and fell to a long and low moan.

The allegation was the use of chemical weapons.    . navbox . navbox p . navbox b . navbox img . normal    Part 4: Americans look for someone to listen to their worries.     "
"       FREDERICK RYAN JR. WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board. DONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it. RYAN: Thank you  …     We’ve heard you’re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly  …     Any you can share with us? TRUMP: Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names  …     Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and   expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that’s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that’s a representative group. FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out? TRUMP: No, other than to say, we’re working hard, I think we’re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I’ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess  —   and I’m your neighbor, I’m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we’re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I’ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn’t, but he’s a real professional. So we’re having a news conference today in the new building that’s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we’re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we’re going to break it in a little bit, so we’re going to open it in September, and it’s under budget, even though we’ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we’re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I’m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done. The GSA [General Services Administration] I will say, GSA has been very professional, they’ve been very, very professional. They chose us over —  I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we’re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope? HOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It’s at 2:15. TRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we’re going to give them a tour of the building. It’s still a little bit rough  —   as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won’t see as much as they think. It’ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it’s finished, right? But that’ll be a fun news conference. HIATT: If I could, I’d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best? TRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry’s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I’ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It’s just a horrible giveaway. HIATT: What in particular? TRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn’t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, ‘release our prisoners,’ they would have said ‘no,’ and we would have said, ‘double up the sanctions,’ and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they’re buying, you noticed, they didn’t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn’t have done that. And I think it’s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it’s going to be bad for Israel. It’s a very bad deal for Israel. HIATT: George Shultz, it’s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today’s world the United States should be doing? TRUMP: I do think it’s a different world today and I don’t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it’s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We’re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it’s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure  —   I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here. HIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that’s not something  …     TRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it’s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they’d be blown up. And we’d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can’t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can’t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I’ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities. HIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let’s say. TRUMP: Well, number one, I’d create economic zones. I’d create incentives for companies to move in. I’d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it’s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is   percent. It’s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans  —   not youth, but African Americans  —   is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that’s why when I open a building and I show you it’s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else —  I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night —  we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can’t  —   it doesn’t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let’s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you’ll have a situation like that, and then we’re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don’t want us there. They want our money, but they don’t want us. HIATT: The root of many people’s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate  —   do you think it’s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation? TRUMP: Well I’ve never really see anything that  —   you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped  —   it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you’d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it’s got to play a big role. It’s got to play a big role. But that’s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening  —   first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I’m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I’m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back. HIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement  —   I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you? TRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I —   HIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement? TRUMP: I’ve read where there are and I’ve read where there aren’t. I mean, I’ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I’m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work.  And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they’ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it’s, it’s tremendous. I’ve seen 5 million jobs, I’ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it’s many millions of jobs, and it’s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier  —   it’s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies  —   they’re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn’t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They’re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they’re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that’s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you’re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it’s going to move to Ireland. RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred’s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about   …     clearly you say you’ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you  —   is that something that concerns you? TRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can’t  —   there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don’t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don’t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a   press on and it doesn’t seem to be, from what I’ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn’t seem to be, doesn’t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems. CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL  : Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that’s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been  —   it’s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it’s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc. etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what’s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what’s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described. TRUMP: I think what’s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it’s divided as bad as I’ve ever seen it. I‘ve been, you know, I’ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21, 000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division  —   not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn’t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There’s a racial division that’s incredible actually in the country. I think it’s as bad, I mean you have to say it’s as bad or almost as bad as it’s ever been. And there’s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn’t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn’t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn’t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there’s a lack of spirit. I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader  —   beyond other things, the other things that I’d do  —   I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it’s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place. RYAN: Mr. Trump, you’ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you’ve mentioned that you want to “open up” the libel laws. You’ve said that several times. TRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: That was an amazing —   RYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws? TRUMP: Okay, look, I’ve had stories written about me  —   by your newspaper and by others  —   that are so false, that are written with such hatred  —   I’m not a bad person. I’m just doing my thing  —   I’m, you know, running, I want to do something that’s good. It’s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I’ve always heard that if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office. And I can understand that. You’ll do a hundred deals, and you’ll do one bad one or two bad ones  —   that’s all they read about are the bad ones. They don’t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I’ve always heard that. I’ve heard that if you’re successful  —   very successful  —   you just can’t run for —   RYAN: But how would you fix that? You’ve said that you would open up the libel laws. TRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I’d  —   well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because  —   not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory  —   because for the most part I think libel laws almost don’t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I’ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong  —   media, when I say paper I’m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they’re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don’t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don’t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for  —   I probably get more  —   do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [Editor’s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus] she kills me, this one  —   that’s okay, nice woman. RYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications? TRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent. MARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me? TRUMP: In a better world  —   no  —   in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction. RYAN: Well, now, you’ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements   …     TRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That’s what happened. But, uh  …     RYAN: But there’s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations? TRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don’t know if it’s malice because the people don’t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we’ve never really met. And I get these stories and they’re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, “How could they write?”  —   and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they’re written. Nobody calls me. STEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining “incorrect?” It seems like you’re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy. TRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I’ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I’ll tell you now and the word “intent” as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I’ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on  —   you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we’ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they’re very bad people. In many cases, they’re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20, 000 seats and they will come in  —   because there’s really no way  —   how you going to be able to tell  —   somebody said “oh you shouldn’t let ‘em in”  —   how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud  —   they’re so loud, these people, I don’t know what they do, they’re trained voices or something. And they’re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like “screw you,” okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn’t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don’t condone violence at all but it’s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know  …     HIATT: Sorry, when you say we don’t condone violence  —   TRUMP: I say that. HIATT: You say that. But you’ve also said, “In the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn’t believe it. ” Isn’t that condoning violence? TRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we’ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy  —   and I said it  —   he had the voice  —   and this was what I was referring to  —   and I said, “Boy, I’d like to smash him. ” You know, I said that. I’d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming  —   you couldn’t make  —   so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, “screw everybody. ” And that’s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out  —   I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he’s giving everybody the finger. And they don’t talk about that. See, they don’t talk about that. They say, “Donald, wait a second, Donald, don’t”  —   HIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible? TRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I’ll tell you what they  —   HIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn’t that violent? TRUMP: Well he punched other people. HIATT: No, I understand that. TRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was  —   one guy was, you know, I’d like to say  —     ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched  —   he didn’t punch anyone  —   TRUMP: No. ARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched. TRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When? ARMAO: In Fayetteville. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina. TRUMP: I don’t know. I don’t know which one. ARMAO: Yes you do. TRUMP: I don’t know. Because we’ve had so many  —   ARMAO: That’s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees. TRUMP: Oh well that’s a different  —   that’s different from the one I’m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville. ARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case  —   TRUMP: No I don’t, no I don’t, that’s different  —   ARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out  —   TRUMP: By the way, that’s different  —   ARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses. TRUMP: He did give the finger, and  —   ARMAO: So that’s okay? TRUMP: Well, a lot of people don’t  —   you know, the finger means, “F you. ” A lot of people think  —   and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents  —   a lot of people think that’s very inappropriate. I mean, you know  —   ARMAO: It’s certainly inappropriate. TRUMP: Well, I think it is. ARMAO: But does it  —   is it  —   does it qualify to  —   TRUMP: So do you let him  —   ARMAO:  —   to punch him in the face? TRUMP: Again I don’t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he’s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in  —   HIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy’s legal fees, isn’t that  —   TRUMP: I didn’t offer  —   HIATT: Isn’t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I didn’t offer, Fred  —   HIATT: You said you would consider it  —   TRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn’t say that. HIATT: Isn’t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. HIATT: Doesn’t that convey a message of approval? TRUMP: Don’t think so. LEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about  —   TRUMP: It’s true. LEWANDOWSKI:  —   any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says  —   TRUMP: Strong. LEWANDOWSKI:  —   please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don’t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, “please do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that. ” That’s said at the very front end at every event. TRUMP: Very loud, and it’s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it’s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It’s not an arena, it’s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people  —   protesters  —   stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars  —   blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20  —   I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, “screw you, screw you, pigs, pigs”  —   meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio  —   now that was his territory. Okay, he’s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car  —   they didn’t move them  —   cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don’t know how they did it  —   just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn’t even know why they were there. People  —   somebody was interviewed, “Why are you here?” “Well, I don’t know, I’m not sure. ” They didn’t even know. Nobody ever talks about these people. They say, “Oh, Trump had a bad rally,” or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it  —   because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a   protesters, there were 21, 000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes  —   not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing. Now Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I’ll be speaking, I’ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of  —   from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities. I know [Lewandowski] went in  —   he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get  —   to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs “ ”  —   it just said “” meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it’s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying “  Trump” or just “” and they had numerous of those  —   there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena. And he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front  —   and I saw it  —   this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him  —   he took him  —   If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him. But the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You’re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [Editor’s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice] “fuck you,” and the whole place goes, “Whoa,” and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, “USA, USA. ” That’s why they’re all screaming “USA, USA,” or “Trump, Trump, Trump. ” You can have 20, 000 people and you can have like two people. Usually  —   it’s amazing  —   usually it’s one person. I mean, it’s like they stage it. It’s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person. Okay, we’re talking about the media. So, I’ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It’s always, “Trump had a”  —   and here’s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard HIATT: But just  —   given the Supreme Court rulings on libel  —   Sullivan v. New York Times  —   how would you change the law? TRUMP: I would just loosen them up. RUTH MARCUS: What does that mean? [Crosstalk] TRUMP: I’d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me  —   and they do, they don’t write good  —   I mean, I don’t think I get  —   I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, “Why are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous. ” I don’t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard. I’m not looking for bad for our country. I’m a very rational person, I’m a very sane person. I’m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we’ve never  —   we don’t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, “Why am I  —   why am I doing this? Why am I even here?” And I don’t expect anything to happen —   RYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel? TRUMP: No, if it’s wrong. If it’s wrong. RYAN: Wrong whether there’s malice or not? TRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, “Why  —   why did you do this?” or “Why did you do that?” It’s just, you know, like I’m this horrible human being. And I’m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story  —   he called because we’re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters  —   but nobody ever calls. RYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you’ve  said three times you’ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when you ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad —   TRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I’m a   person you know, etc. etc. JACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way? TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have  —   I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they’re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with  —   why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I’ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions —   hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are. DIEHL: Hundreds of billions? TRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea   —   I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can’t afford to do this. Certainly we can’t afford to do it anymore. DIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them? TRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don’t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don’t see other people doing much about it. DIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30, 000 troops and —   TRUMP: No I didn’t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you’re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that   to 30, 000. They said, would you send troops? I didn’t say send 20, 000. I said, well the generals are saying you’d need because they  what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need   to 30, 000 troops, but I didn’t say that I would send them. DIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops? TRUMP: I find it hard to go along with —  I mention that as an example because it’s so much. That’s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that’s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I’d give them tremendous air supporters and support  because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so  —   we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved. DIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they’re up to and —   TRUMP: I think it’s a terrible situation, I think it’s terrible they have no respect for —   DIEHL:  —  and what should we do about it? TRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don’t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don’t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But —  and honestly, you know part of —  I always say we have to be unpredictable. We’re totally predictable.  And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say  —   like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left  —   We should have never been in Iraq. It was a   it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, “Keep the oil. If we don’t keep it Iran’s going to get it. ” And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically —   HIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil? TRUMP: You would  …     You would, well for that —   for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas. HIATT: With U. S. troops? TRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil.  And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they’re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don’t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you’re sitting there. And I’ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look. HIATT: So what do you think China’s aims are in the South China Sea? TRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I’ve done very well. China’s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh  …     I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I’ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say ‘oh that’s not the same thing.’ The level of  …     uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world. China has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they’ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn’t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that’s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they’ve built in China. We don’t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what’s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it’s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero. DIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea? TRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so DIEHL: What would you do? TRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They’re selling their products to us for  …     you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can’t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China  —  they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just ‘come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make’ and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it’s just the opposite. You can’t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you’re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It’s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax. HIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States  …     TRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don’t like to tell you what I’d do, because I don’t want to  …     You understand what I’m saying, Fred? If I  …     Okay, if I say ‘Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,’ I don’t want to, I don’t want to sort of  …     red flag all over it. I do think this: It’s an unbelievable thing that they’ve done, it’s unbelievable aggression, it’s unbelievable lack of respect for this country. HIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean  —   there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn’t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I’m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers? TRUMP: Well I’ll give you, I’ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date  —   we’re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do.  And the enemy pulled back, because they don’t want die.  Despite what you read, you know, they don’t want to die  —   and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I’ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we’re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And  …    you shouldn’t do it.  We’re so predictable: “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they’re going to do this and that and that and this. ” And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn’t send them, they wouldn’t  —   if you didn’t say that, they wouldn’t know. I mean, there are times when you just can’t be  …     You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we’re sending fifty troops? I don’t think it was good. LANE: Can I ask you  …    Just going back to NATO, because  …     TRUMP: Yes. LANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning  was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn’t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you’re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there’s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the   was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I’d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you’ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it’s not that you want to pull the U. S. out. TRUMP: No, I don’t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country. We’re borrowing, we’re borrowing all of this money. We’re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we’re protecting Europe but we’re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I’m not even knocking it, I’m just saying I don’t think it’s fair, we’re not treated fair. I don’t think we’re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We’re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing. LANE:  You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it’s basically 50 percent of the   cost is paid by South Korea and Japan. TRUMP: 50 percent? LANE: Yeah. TRUMP: Why isn’t it 100 percent? HIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases? TRUMP: Personally I don’t think so. I personally don’t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that’s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It’s a huge, it’s a massive industrial complex country. And  —   HIATT: So you don’t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific? TRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid  —   let me ask you  —   how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You’re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We’re spending that to protect other countries. We’re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have   vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He’s over in, I mean he’s a very special kid, he’s a great kid. But he’s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it’s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment  —   the new version  —   and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the   people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we’re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we’re backing. And we don’t know if it’s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let’s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It’s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2, 300 Humvees over, all  . So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it’s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have  —   and it’s our equipment. HIATT: I’d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, “They better watch out. They have a lot to hide. ” What should they watch out for? TRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious   …     I don’t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don’t even know these people. HIATT: So, what does it mean, “They better watch out”? TRUMP: Well, it means that I’ll start spending on them. I’ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they’re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I’ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it’s not properly run or that they haven’t done a good job in the brokerage business lately. RYAN: Would you do that while you are president? TRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I’m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I’m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn’t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being   …     I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don’t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn’t win. We don’t win with trade. We don’t win with   …     We can’t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, “Well  …    ” It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off? HIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private   …     TRUMP: No   …     HIATT:   …     your private parts. TRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that. HIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that? TRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here’s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands. MARCUS: You’re on the cover. TRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They’re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, “Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means. ” This was not me. This was Rubio that said, “He has small hands and you know what that means. ” Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later   …     and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, “Mr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have   hands. ” And then another one would say, “You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea. ” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands. ” I had fifty people   …     Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, “How are Mr. Trump’s hands?” My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, “Oh, your hands are very nice. They are normal. ” So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say   …     now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn’t work out. Obviously, it didn’t work too well. But one of the things he said was “He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else. ” You can look it up. I didn’t say it. MARCUS: You chose to raise it   …     TRUMP: No, I chose to respond. MARUS: You chose to respond. TRUMP: I had no choice. MARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice? TRUMP: I don’t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I’m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me   …     every time I’d shake people’s hand, “Oh, you have nice hands. ” Why shouldn’t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions   …     I even held up my hands, and said, “Look, take a look at that hand. ” MARCUS: You told us in the debate   …    . TRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand. MARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that? TRUMP: I don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, ‘Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ I didn’t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the —   a little recap and I said,  and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can’t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I’ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it’s not a question of presidential   …     MARCUS: He said he regrets   …     HIATT: Okay, let’s move on here. Let’s move on. TRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it. RYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You’ve mentioned it many times. You’ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS? TRUMP: I don’t want to use, I don’t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I’m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he’s a   individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars’ worth of negative ads on me. That’s putting [MUFFLED]  …     RYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: I’ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here.  Could I just go around so I know who the hell I’m talking to? HIATT: Sure, then I’d like to let a couple of them get in questions. LEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out. HIATT: Okay. TRUMP: Oh is it? CORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to. TRUMP: Okay we do. ARMAO: I’m   Armao. I cover D. C. events. I  want to ask you a question about what you think about D. C. voting rights or statehood. TRUMP: Okay. I’ll talk about that. TOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles. TRUMP: Hi, Tom. LANE: I’m Charles   …     TRUMP: Yes, I know Charles. STROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer. TRUMP: Right. MARCUS: Ruth Marcus. TRUMP: Right. RYAN:  Fred Ryan. TRUMP: Right, right. DIEHL: Jackson Diehl. TRUMP:  Good. JAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor. TRUMP: Hi, James. MICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I’m the   editor. TRUMP: Yes. CHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba. TRUMP: Hi, Christine. JAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions. TRUMP: Good, yes, yes. KAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor. HIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in? ATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you’ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you’ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a —   how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans? TRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I’m doing very well with African Americans. I’m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I’m doing very well with Hispanics. ATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you’re doing [in the] negatives. TRUMP: We do, if it’s illegals, in other words, if it’s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I’m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I’m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I’m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I’m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don’t forget I haven’t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I’ve had polls that are against me, but I’ve had many polls that say I’d beat Hillary, but they’re not that, that, they don’t mean  anything now because it’s too early. Because I haven’t hit her. I’ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven’t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I’ll be able to make my  points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you. ATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they’re   …    . TRUMP: I don’t think so. No, I don’t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it’s a serious problem. I’ve had Muslims call and tell me you’re right with the Muslim thing, I think it’s a serious problem.  And it’s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there’s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he’s living right next to where he grew up.  There’s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it’s got to be addressed. It’s temporary, and it’s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it’s very positive. HIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country? TRUMP: Well look, there’s many exceptions. There’s many  —   everything, you’re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations  —   Syrians, the whole migration, where we’re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55, 000, okay. 55, 000. Now they say it’s really ten [thousand] but it’s already 10, and I just don’t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did  —   the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible]  —   but you saw what two people did, and I just don’t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There’s no documents, there’s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag  —   you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc. ARMAO: D. C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on “Meet the Press” that you love D. C. you love the people, that you want to do what’s best for them. They think what’s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things? TRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D. C. I think it’s a tough thing. I don’t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D. C. ARMAO: Tough politically? TRUMP: I think it’s just something that I don’t think I’d be inclined to do. I’d like to study it. It’s not a question really  —   maybe Chuck didn’t ask me like you’re asking me  —   I don’t see statehood for D. C. ARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives? TRUMP: I think that’s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay. HIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there   climate change? TRUMP: I think there’s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in   climate change. I’m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes  —   if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don’t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they’re using “extreme weather” I guess more than any other phrase. I am not  —   I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it’s probably a killer with this room  —   but I am not a believer. Perhaps there’s a minor effect, but I’m not a big believer in   climate change. STROMBERG: Don’t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them? TRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we’re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me  —   I know President Obama thought it was climate change  —   to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That’s  —   that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don’t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don’t know who has them. We don’t know who’s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons. RYAN: Thank you for joining us."
"       Donald Trump sat down with the Washington Post’s editorial board on Monday. The interview was, well, amazing.  Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  FREDERICK RYAN JR. WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER: Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board. DONALD TRUMP: New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it. RYAN: Thank you  …     We’ve heard you’re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly  …     Any you can share with us? TRUMP: Well, I hadn’t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names  …     Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and   expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that’s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that’s a representative group. FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Do you want to start out? TRUMP: No, other than to say, we’re working hard, I think we’re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. I’ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess  —   and I’m your neighbor, I’m your neighbor right down the road, in fact we’re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, I’ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesn’t, but he’s a real professional. So we’re having a news conference today in the new building that’s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and we’re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but we’re going to break it in a little bit, so we’re going to open it in September, and it’s under budget, even though we’ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so we’re under budget and ahead of schedule. And I’m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done. The GSA [General Services Administration] I will say, GSA has been very professional, they’ve been very, very professional. They chose us over —  I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So we’re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope? HOPE HICKS, TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON: It’s at 2:15. TRUMP: 2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we’re going to give them a tour of the building. It’s still a little bit rough  —   as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won’t see as much as they think. It’ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it’s finished, right? But that’ll be a fun news conference. HIATT: If I could, I’d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best? TRUMP: Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerry’s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I’ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. It’s just a horrible giveaway. HIATT: What in particular? TRUMP: Well, I think, number one, we shouldn’t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, ‘release our prisoners,’ they would have said ‘no,’ and we would have said, ‘double up the sanctions,’ and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they’re buying, you noticed, they didn’t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn’t have done that. And I think it’s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it’s going to be bad for Israel. It’s a very bad deal for Israel. HIATT: George Shultz, it’s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in today’s world the United States should be doing? TRUMP: I do think it’s a different world today and I don’t think we should be nation building anymore. I think it’s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. We’re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, it’s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure  —   I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here. HIATT: Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that’s not something  …     TRUMP: Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it’s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they’d be blown up. And we’d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can’t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can’t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I’ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities. HIATT: So what would you do for Baltimore, let’s say. TRUMP: Well, number one, I’d create economic zones. I’d create incentives for companies to move in. I’d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it’s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is   percent. It’s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans  —   not youth, but African Americans  —   is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that’s why when I open a building and I show you it’s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else —  I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night —  we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can’t  —   it doesn’t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let’s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you’ll have a situation like that, and then we’re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don’t want us there. They want our money, but they don’t want us. HIATT: The root of many people’s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate  —   do you think it’s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation? TRUMP: Well I’ve never really see anything that  —   you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped  —   it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you’d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it’s got to play a big role. It’s got to play a big role. But that’s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening  —   first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I’m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I’m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back. HIATT: Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement  —   I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you? TRUMP: Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I —   HIATT: Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement? TRUMP: I’ve read where there are and I’ve read where there aren’t. I mean, I’ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what I’m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work. And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And they’ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know it’s, it’s tremendous. I’ve seen 5 million jobs, I’ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But it’s many millions of jobs, and it’s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier  —   it’s all the same: Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies  —   they’re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldn’t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. They’re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, they’re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, that’s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, you’re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and it’s going to move to Ireland. RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST: But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fred’s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about   …     clearly you say you’ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you  —   is that something that concerns you? TRUMP: That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you can’t  —   there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I don’t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I don’t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a   press on and it doesn’t seem to be, from what I’ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesn’t seem to be, doesn’t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems. CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL  : Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that’s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been  —   it’s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it’s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc. etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what’s different specifically about your approach to these issues from what’s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described. TRUMP: I think what’s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it’s divided as bad as I’ve ever seen it. I‘ve been, you know, I’ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21, 000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division  —   not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn’t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There’s a racial division that’s incredible actually in the country. I think it’s as bad, I mean you have to say it’s as bad or almost as bad as it’s ever been. And there’s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn’t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn’t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn’t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there’s a lack of spirit. I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader  —   beyond other things, the other things that I’d do  —   I actually think I’d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it’s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place. RYAN: Mr. Trump, you’ve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and you’ve mentioned that you want to “open up” the libel laws. You’ve said that several times. TRUMP: I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: That was an amazing —   RYAN: My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws? TRUMP: Okay, look, I’ve had stories written about me  —   by your newspaper and by others  —   that are so false, that are written with such hatred  —   I’m not a bad person. I’m just doing my thing  —   I’m, you know, running, I want to do something that’s good. It’s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I’ve always heard that if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office. And I can understand that. You’ll do a hundred deals, and you’ll do one bad one or two bad ones  —   that’s all they read about are the bad ones. They don’t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I’ve always heard that. I’ve heard that if you’re successful  —   very successful  —   you just can’t run for —   RYAN: But how would you fix that? You’ve said that you would open up the libel laws. TRUMP: What I would do, what I would do is I’d  —   well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because  —   not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory  —   because for the most part I think libel laws almost don’t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything I’ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong  —   media, when I say paper I’m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if they’re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they don’t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I don’t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for  —   I probably get more  —   do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [Editor’s note: Trump points at Ruth Marcus] she kills me, this one  —   that’s okay, nice woman. RYAN: Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications? TRUMP: No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent. MARCUS: So in a better world would you be able to sue me? TRUMP: In a better world  —   no  —   in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction. RYAN: Well, now, you’ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements   …     TRUMP: I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That’s what happened. But, uh  …     RYAN: But there’s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations? TRUMP: I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don’t know if it’s malice because the people don’t know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we’ve never really met. And I get these stories and they’re so angry and I actually say, I actually say, “How could they write?”  —   and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they’re written. Nobody calls me. STEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER: How are you defining “incorrect?” It seems like you’re defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy. TRUMP: Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, I’ve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. I’ll tell you now and the word “intent” as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. I’ll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on  —   you know I get these massive crowds of people, and we’ll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, they’re very bad people. In many cases, they’re professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20, 000 seats and they will come in  —   because there’s really no way  —   how you going to be able to tell  —   somebody said “oh you shouldn’t let ‘em in”  —   how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud  —   they’re so loud, these people, I don’t know what they do, they’re trained voices or something. And they’re walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like “screw you,” okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didn’t make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We don’t condone violence at all but it’s very, very unfair reporting and we, you know  …     HIATT: Sorry, when you say we don’t condone violence  —   TRUMP: I say that. HIATT: You say that. But you’ve also said, “In the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn’t believe it. ” Isn’t that condoning violence? TRUMP: No, because what I am referring to is, we’ve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy  —   and I said it  —   he had the voice  —   and this was what I was referring to  —   and I said, “Boy, I’d like to smash him. ” You know, I said that. I’d like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming  —   you couldn’t make  —   so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, “screw everybody. ” And that’s when I made that statement. He was absolutely out  —   I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he’s giving everybody the finger. And they don’t talk about that. See, they don’t talk about that. They say, “Donald, wait a second, Donald, don’t”  —   HIATT: But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible? TRUMP: No, I condone strong law and order. I’ll tell you what they  —   HIATT: Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn’t that violent? TRUMP: Well he punched other people. HIATT: No, I understand that. TRUMP: Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was  —   one guy was, you know, I’d like to say  —     ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched  —   he didn’t punch anyone  —   TRUMP: No. ARMAO: He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched. TRUMP: No. When are you talking about? When? ARMAO: In Fayetteville. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]: North Carolina. TRUMP: I don’t know. I don’t know which one. ARMAO: Yes you do. TRUMP: I don’t know. Because we’ve had so many  —   ARMAO: That’s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees. TRUMP: Oh well that’s a different  —   that’s different from the one I’m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville. ARMAO: Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case  —   TRUMP: No I don’t, no I don’t, that’s different  —   ARMAO: Where the protester is being walked out  —   TRUMP: By the way, that’s different  —   ARMAO: But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses. TRUMP: He did give the finger, and  —   ARMAO: So that’s okay? TRUMP: Well, a lot of people don’t  —   you know, the finger means, “F you. ” A lot of people think  —   and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents  —   a lot of people think that’s very inappropriate. I mean, you know  —   ARMAO: It’s certainly inappropriate. TRUMP: Well, I think it is. ARMAO: But does it  —   is it  —   does it qualify to  —   TRUMP: So do you let him  —   ARMAO:  —   to punch him in the face? TRUMP: Again I don’t condone it. So do you let him walk out, he’s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in  —   HIATT: I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy’s legal fees, isn’t that  —   TRUMP: I didn’t offer  —   HIATT: Isn’t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I didn’t offer, Fred  —   HIATT: You said you would consider it  —   TRUMP: I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn’t say that. HIATT: Isn’t that condoning? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. HIATT: Doesn’t that convey a message of approval? TRUMP: Don’t think so. LEWANDOWSKI: To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about  —   TRUMP: It’s true. LEWANDOWSKI:  —   any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says  —   TRUMP: Strong. LEWANDOWSKI:  —   please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there don’t have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, “please do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that. ” That’s said at the very front end at every event. TRUMP: Very loud, and it’s repeated over and over. Actually, I guess it’s on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. It’s not an arena, it’s a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people  —   protesters  —   stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars  —   blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20  —   I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, “screw you, screw you, pigs, pigs”  —   meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio  —   now that was his territory. Okay, he’s a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car  —   they didn’t move them  —   cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I don’t know how they did it  —   just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didn’t even know why they were there. People  —   somebody was interviewed, “Why are you here?” “Well, I don’t know, I’m not sure. ” They didn’t even know. Nobody ever talks about these people. They say, “Oh, Trump had a bad rally,” or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it  —   because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a   protesters, there were 21, 000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes  —   not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing. Now Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, I’ll be speaking, I’ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of  —   from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities. I know [Lewandowski] went in  —   he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get  —   to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs “ ”  —   it just said “” meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, it’s on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying “  Trump” or just “” and they had numerous of those  —   there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena. And he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front  —   and I saw it  —   this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him  —   he took him  —   If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him. But the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this: You’re making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [Editor’s note: Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice] “fuck you,” and the whole place goes, “Whoa,” and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, “USA, USA. ” That’s why they’re all screaming “USA, USA,” or “Trump, Trump, Trump. ” You can have 20, 000 people and you can have like two people. Usually  —   it’s amazing  —   usually it’s one person. I mean, it’s like they stage it. It’s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person. Okay, we’re talking about the media. So, I’ve never seen the media cover it from that angle. It’s always, “Trump had a”  —   and here’s the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard HIATT: But just  —   given the Supreme Court rulings on libel  —   Sullivan v. New York Times  —   how would you change the law? TRUMP: I would just loosen them up. RUTH MARCUS: What does that mean? [Crosstalk] TRUMP: I’d have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me  —   and they do, they don’t write good  —   I mean, I don’t think I get  —   I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, “Why are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous. ” I don’t know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard. I’m not looking for bad for our country. I’m a very rational person, I’m a very sane person. I’m not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, we’ve never  —   we don’t know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, “Why am I  —   why am I doing this? Why am I even here?” And I don’t expect anything to happen —   RYAN: Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel? TRUMP: No, if it’s wrong. If it’s wrong. RYAN: Wrong whether there’s malice or not? TRUMP: I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, “Why  —   why did you do this?” or “Why did you do that?” It’s just, you know, like I’m this horrible human being. And I’m not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story  —   he called because we’re meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters  —   but nobody ever calls. RYAN: The reason I keep asking this is because you’ve said three times you’ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when you ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad —   TRUMP: I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I’m a   person you know, etc. etc. JACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR: Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way? TRUMP: Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have  —   I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, they’re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with  —   why are we always the one that’s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I’ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions —   hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are. DIEHL: Hundreds of billions? TRUMP: Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea  —   I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can’t afford to do this. Certainly we can’t afford to do it anymore. DIEHL: About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them? TRUMP: I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don’t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don’t see other people doing much about it. DIEHL: And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30, 000 troops and —   TRUMP: No I didn’t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you’re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that   to 30, 000. They said, would you send troops? I didn’t say send 20, 000. I said, well the generals are saying you’d need because they  what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need   to 30, 000 troops, but I didn’t say that I would send them. DIEHL: If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops? TRUMP: I find it hard to go along with —  I mention that as an example because it’s so much. That’s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that’s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I’d give them tremendous air supporters and support  because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so  —   we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved. DIEHL: What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they’re up to and —   TRUMP: I think it’s a terrible situation, I think it’s terrible they have no respect for —   DIEHL:  —  and what should we do about it? TRUMP: Well look, we have power over China and people don’t realize it. We have trade power over China. I don’t think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But —  and honestly, you know part of —  I always say we have to be unpredictable. We’re totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say  —   like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left  —   We should have never been in Iraq. It was a   it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, “Keep the oil. If we don’t keep it Iran’s going to get it. ” And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically —   HIATT: How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil? TRUMP: You would  …     You would, well for that —   for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas. HIATT: With U. S. troops? TRUMP: Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they’re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don’t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you’re sitting there. And I’ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look. HIATT: So what do you think China’s aims are in the South China Sea? TRUMP: Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. I’ve done very well. China’s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uh  …     I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, I’ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say ‘oh that’s not the same thing.’ The level of  …     uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world. China has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that they’ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldn’t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, that’s like a trinket compared to the bridges that they’ve built in China. We don’t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at what’s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and it’s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero. DIEHL: Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea? TRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so DIEHL: What would you do? TRUMP: We, well, you start making it tougher. They’re selling their products to us for  …     you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can’t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China  —  they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just ‘come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make’ and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it’s just the opposite. You can’t do that. In other words, if you want to, if you’re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It’s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax. HIATT: So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States  …     TRUMP: Well, I, you know, again, I don’t like to tell you what I’d do, because I don’t want to  …     You understand what I’m saying, Fred? If I  …     Okay, if I say ‘Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,’ I don’t want to, I don’t want to sort of  …     red flag all over it. I do think this: It’s an unbelievable thing that they’ve done, it’s unbelievable aggression, it’s unbelievable lack of respect for this country. HIATT: This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean  —   there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn’t clear that we would defend South Korea. So I’m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers? TRUMP: Well I’ll give you, I’ll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date  —   we’re going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don’t want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don’t want to die  —   and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I’ll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we’re sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And  …    you shouldn’t do it. We’re so predictable: “Ladies and gentlemen, we’re sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they’re going to do this and that and that and this. ” And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn’t send them, they wouldn’t  —   if you didn’t say that, they wouldn’t know. I mean, there are times when you just can’t be  …     You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we’re sending fifty troops? I don’t think it was good. LANE: Can I ask you  …    Just going back to NATO, because  …     TRUMP: Yes. LANE: As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn’t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you’re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there’s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the   was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I’d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you’ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it’s not that you want to pull the U. S. out. TRUMP: No, I don’t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We’re not a rich country. We’re borrowing, we’re borrowing all of this money. We’re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we’re protecting Europe but we’re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I’m not even knocking it, I’m just saying I don’t think it’s fair, we’re not treated fair. I don’t think we’re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we’re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We’re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We’re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing. LANE: You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it’s basically 50 percent of the   cost is paid by South Korea and Japan. TRUMP: 50 percent? LANE: Yeah. TRUMP: Why isn’t it 100 percent? HIATT: Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases? TRUMP: Personally I don’t think so. I personally don’t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that’s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It’s a huge, it’s a massive industrial complex country. And  —   HIATT: So you don’t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific? TRUMP: I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we’re a poor country now. We’re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid  —   let me ask you  —   how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You’re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We’re spending that to protect other countries. We’re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have   vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He’s over in, I mean he’s a very special kid, he’s a great kid. But he’s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it’s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment  —   the new version  —   and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the   people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we’re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we’re backing. And we don’t know if it’s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let’s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. It’s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2, 300 Humvees over, all  . So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it’s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have  —   and it’s our equipment. HIATT: I’d like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, “They better watch out. They have a lot to hide. ” What should they watch out for? TRUMP: Look, they are spending vicious   …     I don’t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don’t even know these people. HIATT: So, what does it mean, “They better watch out”? TRUMP: Well, it means that I’ll start spending on them. I’ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they’re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I’ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it’s not properly run or that they haven’t done a good job in the brokerage business lately. RYAN: Would you do that while you are president? TRUMP: No, not while I am president. No, not while I’m president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I’m an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn’t be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being   …     I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don’t win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn’t win. We don’t win with trade. We don’t win with   …     We can’t even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, “Well  …    ” It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off? HIATT: Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private   …     TRUMP: No   …     HIATT:   …     your private parts. TRUMP: No, no. No, no. I am not doing that. HIATT: Do you regret having engaged in that? TRUMP: No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here’s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands. MARCUS: You’re on the cover. TRUMP: A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They’re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, “Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means. ” This was not me. This was Rubio that said, “He has small hands and you know what that means. ” Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later   …     and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, “Mr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have   hands. ” And then another one would say, “You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea. ” I said, “What do you mean?” He said, “I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands. ” I had fifty people   …     Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, “How are Mr. Trump’s hands?” My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, “Oh, your hands are very nice. They are normal. ” So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say   …     now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn’t work out. Obviously, it didn’t work too well. But one of the things he said was “He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else. ” You can look it up. I didn’t say it. MARCUS: You chose to raise it   …     TRUMP: No, I chose to respond. MARUS: You chose to respond. TRUMP: I had no choice. MARCUS: You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice? TRUMP: I don’t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I’m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me   …     every time I’d shake people’s hand, “Oh, you have nice hands. ” Why shouldn’t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions   …     I even held up my hands, and said, “Look, take a look at that hand. ” MARCUS: You told us in the debate   …    . TRUMP: And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand. MARCUS: You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that? TRUMP: I don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, ‘Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ I didn’t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the —   a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can’t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I’ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it’s not a question of presidential   …     MARCUS: He said he regrets   …     HIATT: Okay, let’s move on here. Let’s move on. TRUMP: I did feel I should respond. Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it. RYAN: You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. You’ve mentioned it many times. You’ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS? TRUMP: I don’t want to use, I don’t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I’m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he’s a   individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars’ worth of negative ads on me. That’s putting [MUFFLED]  …     RYAN: This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS? [CROSSTALK] TRUMP: I’ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here. Could I just go around so I know who the hell I’m talking to? HIATT: Sure, then I’d like to let a couple of them get in questions. LEWANDOWSKI: We have got five minutes, hard out. HIATT: Okay. TRUMP: Oh is it? CORY: Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to. TRUMP: Okay we do. ARMAO: I’m   Armao. I cover D. C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D. C. voting rights or statehood. TRUMP: Okay. I’ll talk about that. TOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST: Tom Toles. TRUMP: Hi, Tom. LANE: I’m Charles   …     TRUMP: Yes, I know Charles. STROMBERG: Steve Stromberg, editorial writer. TRUMP: Right. MARCUS: Ruth Marcus. TRUMP: Right. RYAN: Fred Ryan. TRUMP: Right, right. DIEHL: Jackson Diehl. TRUMP: Good. JAMES DOWNIE: James Downie, digital opinions editor. TRUMP: Hi, James. MICHAEL LARABEE: Mike Larabee, I’m the   editor. TRUMP: Yes. CHRISTINE EMBA: Christine Emba. TRUMP: Hi, Christine. JAMIE RILEY: Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions. TRUMP: Good, yes, yes. KAREN ATTIAH: Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor. HIATT: Karen, you want to get a question in? ATTIAH: Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you’ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you’ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a —   how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans? TRUMP: Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I’m doing very well with African Americans. I’m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I’m doing very well with Hispanics. ATTIAH: I think some of the polls are saying you’re doing [in the] negatives. TRUMP: We do, if it’s illegals, in other words, if it’s everybody, but people that are legally living here, I’m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I’m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I’m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I’m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don’t forget I haven’t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I’ve had polls that are against me, but I’ve had many polls that say I’d beat Hillary, but they’re not that, that, they don’t mean anything now because it’s too early. Because I haven’t hit her. I’ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven’t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I’ll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you. ATTIAH: But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they’re   …    . TRUMP: I don’t think so. No, I don’t think so. With the Muslim thing I think it’s a serious problem. I’ve had Muslims call and tell me you’re right with the Muslim thing, I think it’s a serious problem. And it’s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there’s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he’s living right next to where he grew up. There’s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it’s got to be addressed. It’s temporary, and it’s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it’s very positive. HIATT: How would you identify people to keep them out of this country? TRUMP: Well look, there’s many exceptions. There’s many  —   everything, you’re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations  —   Syrians, the whole migration, where we’re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55, 000, okay. 55, 000. Now they say it’s really ten [thousand] but it’s already 10, and I just don’t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did  —   the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible]  —   but you saw what two people did, and I just don’t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. There’s no documents, there’s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag  —   you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc. ARMAO: D. C.: You told Chuck Todd last year on “Meet the Press” that you love D. C. you love the people, that you want to do what’s best for them. They think what’s best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things? TRUMP: I think statehood is a tough thing for D. C. I think it’s a tough thing. I don’t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D. C. ARMAO: Tough politically? TRUMP: I think it’s just something that I don’t think I’d be inclined to do. I’d like to study it. It’s not a question really  —   maybe Chuck didn’t ask me like you’re asking me  —   I don’t see statehood for D. C. ARMAO: What about having a vote in the House of Representatives? TRUMP: I think that’s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay. HIATT: Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there   climate change? TRUMP: I think there’s a change in weather. I am not a great believer in   climate change. I’m not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes  —   if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don’t know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they’re using “extreme weather” I guess more than any other phrase. I am not  —   I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it’s probably a killer with this room  —   but I am not a believer. Perhaps there’s a minor effect, but I’m not a big believer in   climate change. STROMBERG: Don’t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them? TRUMP: Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we’re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me  —   I know President Obama thought it was climate change  —   to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That’s  —   that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don’t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don’t know who has them. We don’t know who’s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons. RYAN: Thank you for joining us.

Jabin   Washington Post  "
"     It’s Wednesday, so Kim Conley will run 11 miles, pretty much like any other day, except that on Wednesdays, she runs depleted  —   meaning she’s eaten exactly nothing. The idea is to be tough, reach down, push herself even harder than every other day. She chews up the miles along the American River in Sacramento to keep shaving off seconds to keep getting closer to Rio. Conley, 30, has been running toward this summer’s Olympic Games for nearly a decade. But she’d also like to have a baby someday. Two things stand between Conley and what could well be her last chance to win an Olympic medal. One is the clock, and she knows she can beat it. She’s lopped seconds off her time every year since she started running seriously. The other is a   critter named Aedes, a   mosquito with a   bite.   [Zika is the latest battle in a long war between humans and mosquitoes]   By the millions, Aedes skeeters are feeding on people who carry an unpredictable virus named Zika, then flitting over to their next victim, chomping down and spreading the disease. The bug’s bites have transmitted the virus to people in more than 20 countries: to pregnant mothers, with devastating consequences for their unborn children; to thousands of other people, who end up with fairly minor aches; and quite possibly this summer, to the best athletes in the world, gathered in one vulnerable place, wearing very little clothing. The scramble to solve the Zika puzzle requires scientists to figure out exactly what threat a hardy breed of mosquitoes poses to people along the virus’s jagged journey. Crossing four continents since the first major outbreak nine years ago, Zika’s painful path now touches an Olympic runner in California, and before her a nurse from Indiana, pregnant women in Colombia, a misshapen infant in Brazil, immunologists in Bethesda, Md. all the way back to the owner of a souvenir shop on a tiny island in the South Pacific, 1, 100 miles southeast of the Philippines. The hunt to understand Zika is a race to the very edge of science’s frontier, a race against the ticking clock of myriad pregnancies.    See the full graphic here. (Washington Post)  Conley’s passion and training push her to keep running toward Rio, even as a mounting clamor of warnings urge her to consider a detour. On a cool, sunny California morning at the cusp of spring, she can run straight ahead or look instead at the destruction and anxiety that Zika has caused, anguishing expectant mothers from Brazil up into the Caribbean and now even in the United States. This is the story of Zika’s path so far, from its leading edge today back to its first appearance on a Pacific island in 2007. As the virus’s inexorable march brings it our way, scientists and governments are issuing a stream of strongly worded alerts. The chief of the federal bureaucracy in Washington this month urgently warned government employees to think twice about going to Brazil and other countries where the virus is rampant. The World Health Organization and the U. S. military put out similar warnings. But the U. S. Olympic Committee, buffeted between its desire to give elite athletes their moment  and its responsibility to protect competitors and their fans, has held back, issuing no guidance, announcing only that it will seek counsel from medical advisers. Conley tries not to think about Zika. Her team  —   manager, agent, sports psychologist, physiologist, sponsor  —   is all about confidence: Rio or bust. Conley is a planner. She used to think in units of a school year. Then, preparing to run   and   events in the London Olympics four years ago, she learned that elite athletes think in “quads,”   cycles leading to the next Games. After Conley failed to get past the qualifying heats in London, she’s spent this quad entirely focused on next steps, to Rio, then Tokyo in 2020, then maybe coaching, or becoming a physical therapist, or having a baby. Zika and pregnancy Her husband and coach, Drew Wartenburg, thinks shorter term. He’s forever nudging Kim to live in the moment. “I call myself more an actor than a planner,” he says.   [The agonizing wait of an expectant mother with Zika: ‘Is my baby okay? ’]   They haven’t talked much about kids, except that a baby would fit into their lives after Kim finishes running competitively. Then they started hearing about newborns in Brazil with heads that came out too small and pregnant women who felt compelled to consider abortions when they wanted to be preparing to raise a child. Now, Conley and Wartenburg have to think about it. They’ve talked about whether Conley’s    sister, already at the point where she wants a baby, should travel to Rio to watch Kim run. “She’s someone who probably shouldn’t go,” Conley says. “For us, we just have to wait. ” Zika keeps poking its head into their plans. Friends and neighbors keep asking about it. Family, too. “You want them to be excited about your Olympic journey,” Conley says, “and they’re mostly concerned about the Zika virus, and that’s too bad. ” Wartenburg the coach uses the virus as a motivator. “This is about confronting obstacles,” he says. “Part of what makes athletes elite is not letting any obstacle stand in your way. ” Conley glances over at him, eyebrow cocked. It’s not clear she’s buying this as a motivational tool. Wartenburg the husband tries another tack. “You can’t have thousands of different athletes making thousands of different decisions about ‘Do I wrap myself in mosquito nets, or what?’ That’s not a burden I want. We just have to trust that someone will assess the risk and that their thinking will trickle down to us. ” Conley is quiet. When she speaks, it’s in a small voice: “No one’s said, ‘Don’t go.’ ”    Two things stand between Conley and what could well be her last chance to win an Olympic medal. One is the clock, and she knows she can beat it. The other is a   critter named Aedes, a   mosquito with a   bite. (Photo by Carlos Javier Ortiz for The Washington Post)  January 2016: A scary mask Barbara Ihrke went with plenty of mosquito repellent. When Ihrke, a    nurse, decided to travel from Indiana to Haiti in January to teach a seminar in transcultural nursing, she’d heard a bit about Zika but hadn’t paid much attention to the news from Brazil. Despite slathering herself with repellent, Ihrke got a few bites. She thought nothing of it. She came home in late January, feeling fine. Then, on her fifth day back in Marion, Ind. she got a   headache. She felt tired, her joints swelled up, and a rash spread over much of her body, including, for a couple of days, on her face. Zika, it turned out, was already in the Caribbean, and people such as Ihrke were bringing it home with them. Enough cases had popped up in Haiti that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called the island nation a place of extreme concern.   [Want to avoid Zika? Stay more than a mile above sea level, CDC says]   Two days after her symptoms hit, Ihrke, who works as vice president of academic affairs at Indiana Wesleyan University’s nursing school, called her school’s health center and said, “I think I have Zika. ” She was   . Trained in tropical medicine, she reacted more calmly than a layman might have. By the time she got to the clinic an hour later, the staff had printed out fact sheets from the CDC on Zika. Tests showed her    count had dropped by half. She stayed home that weekend and went to work the next Monday wearing a mask  —   not because she was putting anyone else at risk of infection, but for her own protection, because of her low blood count. What can be done to prevent Zika? As casually as Ihrke reacted to the virus, those around her were more alarmed, especially during the eight days when she wore the mask. “People took a step back when they saw it,” she says. When one man pulled away and announced that his wife was pregnant, Ihrke set him straight: “I can’t give this to you, and there are no mosquitoes in Indiana in February. ” That assurance wasn’t enough for some people. Ihrke can’t guarantee that the virus isn’t still active in her bloodstream, and some neighbors have told her they’re afraid to get too close. Still, Ihrke felt it was important to identify herself as Indiana’s first Zika case, even though state health officials had assured her they’d keep her identity secret. “Part of my calling is to help us react to illnesses, so I decided I should   because I have the ability to explain,” she says. Ihrke’s professional detachment lets her see that for most victims, Zika is no big deal. Having lived and worked in Africa, she says, “knowing that thousands of people die every day from malaria and now seeing that we’re spending millions of dollars on Zika, well, at times we in the U. S. are not rational about what we decide is scariest. We’ve gone into the Ebola mentality, which is that the sky is falling. We invested so much money in making everybody in America   and for what, maybe 10 cases in the U. S.? In a year or two, we’ll hardly remember Zika. ” Less than two weeks after she first felt ill, Ihrke got the   a call from the health center telling her that her blood count was back to normal. She’s ready to return to Haiti, proposing to study the incidence of birth defects there in the coming year. But she knows heading into Zika’s lair is not the right choice for some people. “For the Olympic athletes, it’s hard,” Ihrke says. “Anyone who wanted to be pregnant, I’d say, ‘Are you certain this is what you want to do?’ ”      Darley Martinez Cabarcas, 17, stands for a portrait at Fundación Juan Felipe Gómez Escobar, where she receives regular checkups for her pregnancy in Cartagena on Feb. 19. (Dania Maxwell for the Washington Post)  November 2015: ‘I was five months pregnant’ Two Colombian teenagers, both eight months pregnant, stand outside a health clinic in Cartagena, waiting to know what Zika has done to their babies. “You got it, too?” Yisleth Luna Cardenas, 18, asks Darley Martinez Cabarcas, who is 17. “When I was five months pregnant,” Darley says, recalling the headaches and fever she had in November. “I see the news. I see the babies being born with big problems. Aren’t you worried?” Yisleth dealt with Zika anxiety by focusing not on possible birth defects, but on delivering her first baby: “Will it be a Caesarean section? How painful will the labor be?” Darley cracks a smile, enjoying a rare shared moment in what she calls the “solitude of being pregnant with Zika. ” “I know everyone is worried  —   men, too  —   but so much falls to the women,” she says. “We carry the babies, and then we will raise the babies. ” A pause. “My boyfriend wanted me to abort. ” A Catholic, Darley says it is wrong to have an abortion. She is no longer in touch with the baby’s father. Now, in March, she waits. She knows the virus has been linked to severe birth defects, including microcephaly, the interrupted development of the skull that leads to abnormally small heads and brain damage. The virus has been active in Colombia long enough to have infected thousands of pregnant women, but not yet long enough to reveal whether the defects that have become rampant in Brazil will happen here. What is microcephaly? Zika’s aches subside quickly; the real pain sets in when the women are strong enough to start worrying about what the virus may have done to the baby inside them. “It’s a lonely time,” Darley says. Being pregnant with Zika is not something you can talk to your mother about, because it’s so new. “I can’t wait to have the baby in my arms, to see with my own eyes that he is okay. ” At the Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation, a nonprofit serving   teenage mothers, Darley and Yisleth attend job skill classes and get sonograms. The scans show no sign of microcephaly. But the doctors also say that developmental and neurological problems linked to Zika might not show up on a scan. Darley goes home to wait with her mother, sister and grandmother  —   her father no longer lives with the family. “Women have it hard,” she says.    Rozilene Ferreira de Mesquita kisses her son, Arthur Ferreira da Conceicao as she poses for a portrait at Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco on March 14 in Recife, Brazil. (Matt   The Washington Post)  October 2015: A tiny skull While Darley and Yisleth wait, Zika’s impact is already clear 3, 000 miles to the southeast, where a mother and a physical therapist try to soothe an agitated, bent baby boy named Arthur. The therapist places Arthur   on a yellow exercise ball. He immediately begins to cry. The way his    body is shaped, shoulders hunched, arms and legs perpetually bent and clenched  —   typical for microcephalic babies  —   doing anything on his stomach feels uncomfortable. The therapist rubs his back while his mother, Rozilene Ferreira de Mesquita, puts a pacifier in his mouth. “Calm down,” she whispers. Arthur has appointments lined up for visual testing,   development and auditory stimulation at the Altino Ventura Foundation hospital in the Brazilian city of Recife. On Thursdays, dozens of mothers of babies with abnormally small heads gather here for therapy sessions, group talks and   birthday celebrations. Of 6, 671 suspected microcephaly cases in Brazil, 1, 819 of them are in this state, Pernambuco, the highest proportion in the country. Recife, the ‘ground zero’ of the zika virus Thousands of parents now spend their days visiting doctors who   scan, probe, bend and measure their babies to try to understand what Zika has done. Just three days into March, de Mesquita has already filled a piece of notebook paper with 25 doctors’ visits Arthur must make at eight hospitals over the course of the month. She refuses to miss an appointment. Once her maternity leave ended, she resorted to doctors’ notes to explain her absence from work. She expects to lose her job. Then the family will subsist on her husband’s   salary of $220 per month. “I work for my son now,” she says. “My son is my boss, and he’s a picky boss. ” De Mesquita, 39, contracted Zika last March, the second month of her pregnancy, after a   Friday on the beach in Suape, a town south of Recife where her husband worked as a hotel security guard.    See the full graphic here. (Washington Post)  The next weekend, she woke feeling achy, with a rash on her arms and torso, and an infuriating itch. Recife was not yet known as the epicenter of a   outbreak. There were as yet no billboards along the highways warning about microcephaly. In the hallways of the state health ministry, where de Mesquita worked as a cleaner, she’d never heard the name Zika. She went to her neighborhood clinic, already packed with people with the same symptoms. Doctors treated her for an allergic reaction, which didn’t help, then tested her for dengue fever and rubella. “I was so happy when they came out negative,” she says. “But it turned out that this was worse. ” Arthur Ferreira da Conceicao was born on Oct. 1 after a relatively painless two hours of labor, far easier than her first son, 15 years earlier. But Arthur’s body felt cold, and his skull was tiny, just 11 inches in circumference. The forehead was foreshortened. The back of his head was flat, with wrinkled skin. Within minutes, a doctor informed her there was a problem: Arthur had microcephaly. De Mesquita hadn’t heard the term. “It’s weird, “ the doctor told her, “we already have seven other babies at the hospital with that right now. ”   [Zika: More than 2, 500 babies born with microcephaly in Brazil, WHO predicts]   Arthur couldn’t leave the hospital for 27 days. As he has grown, his problems have deepened. His body seems frozen in a rictus of tension. His mother writes lists of questions for the doctors: Can he see or hear? Will he ever walk, talk, read, go to school? The answers are always the same: “I don’t know. ” In her small concrete house in a hillside slum, de Mesquita has filled Arthur’s crib with toys the therapists recommend. She built a rattle out of a water bottle filled with black beans, to test his hearing. She made a paddle with black and white stripes that she shines with a flashlight to encourage visual perception. On the wall of Arthur’s room, bug repellent mists from a   dispenser. To get to their first appointment, de Mesquita wakes at 4 a. m. tidies up, does the laundry, and feeds Arthur. She kisses her husband goodbye and walks into a warm, drizzling morning as insects trill and roosters crow. She is resigned to another trying commute.    Rozilene Ferreira de Mesquita, center, holds her son, Arthur Ferreira da Conceicao as she listens to a doctor during a visit to Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco for Arthur on March 14 Recife, Brazil. (Matt   The Washington Post)  “People are always staring,” de Mesquita says. “I know people are thinking, ‘What a small head. They’re not thinking, ‘Oh, that baby’s beautiful.’ ” She transfers from the bus to a packed subway car. Passengers crowded around her stare at Arthur. A woman in a yellow tank top speaks loudly to de Mesquita, and others turn to look: “Did you have Zika? You had that thing?” De Mesquita ignores the passengers and tries to soothe Arthur, who is sobbing, heaving, his face contorted in anguish. “Calma,” she says, rubbing his head. Her days unspool in waiting rooms on rows of hard plastic chairs bolted in place. Her hours slip by in a numbing drift of chitchat with other microcephaly moms. The moms started a WhatsApp group  —   more than 120 women strong  —   to share   tips for microcephaly kids.   [Poor Brazilian mothers join hands, turn to social media amid microcephaly crisis]   De Mesquita arrives at 6:45 a. m. at this morning’s hospital, the Association for the Assistance of Children with Deficiencies. She takes a number, 300, and waits for a doctor, who undresses Arthur, claps next to each ear, blows on his eyes, testing his sensations. Arthur’s body at rest is clenched and rigid, his hands in fists, his legs crossed. As the doctor pulls Arthur’s shoulders back, stretching his chest, the baby screams. “Don’t cry,” de Mesquita whispers. Five hours later, she walks back to the bus station and opens her umbrella to protect Arthur from the blazing sun. A woman comes up to de Mesquita. “Jesus only gives children like this to people who are really strong, who are warriors,” the woman says. “You have the capacity to care for him. Someone without faith can’t do it, but you have faith. ” De Mesquita stands up, hefting Arthur onto her hip. “That’s my bus,” she says.    As the Zika virus continues to spread, scientists in Recife, Brazil, are searching for a quicker, less expensive test to detect the virus. (Whitney Leaming, Zoeann   Washington Post)   July 2015: A new mystery   Kong opens a white   the size found in many a dorm room, and slides out a box labeled “Zik V DNA Vaccine. ” He lifts the cover and removes one of about a dozen tiny vials of DNA plasmas that he and his colleagues at the Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Md. have synthesized to see if they can prompt cells to protect against the Zika virus. Countries that have the Zika virus “Time is important,” Kong says. “When you see the pictures of the babies. . . . ” He stops himself. “I don’t really want to look at those pictures. I can’t imagine being those parents. ” Ever since last July, when a Brazilian physician pulled aside one of the Vaccine Research Center’s top scientists at a conference in Rockville, warning him about a disturbing, rampant virus, Kong’s lab on the campus of the National Institutes of Health has been transformed into an   war room. Rows of scientists painstakingly design and test dozens of different sequences of DNA, searching for those that might prompt creation of the perfect protein. Around the country, scientists are studying cells isolated from people recovering from Zika. They need to learn how the virus works on people, why symptoms show up as they have, and how to make the human body defend itself. The goal is a vaccine, produced in the millions of doses, to be given to young children, ideally a   lifelong immunization. On the fourth floor of the Vaccine Research Center, created 16 years ago to develop protection against HIV, the best candidates for a vaccine will be injected into lab mice to see if they become immunized. “The first round of mouse immunizations have not been the best,” says Barney Graham, the virologist who runs the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory. “So we continue. Every week, there’s another mouse experiment. ” At the moment, the freezer contains 29 bacterial recipes. The goal is to begin testing vaccines this fall.   [Zika has been linked to birth defects. Now it may be causing paralysis.]   In lab after lab in their modern    building, people who’d been working on HIV, Middle East respiratory syndrome or flu vaccines have shifted gears and launched a   drive against Zika. They still think mostly in timelines composed of years and decades, but that’s changing. In the past eight years, thanks mainly to research conducted toward an HIV vaccine, the process has sped up as researchers map the atomic structures of a virus and identify antibodies that lead toward a vaccine. Starting in 2003, it took 20 months to develop a vaccine to be tested against SARS. When avian flu hit a couple of years later, the process was slimmed down to 11 months. And in 2009’s H5N1 virus outbreak, the lab got its development work done in four months. If all goes well in Bethesda, a vaccine could be ready for distribution in 2018. “We’re always in a hurry here,” Graham says. “We’re still in a hurry on HIV even though it’s been 15 years. But we’re seeing more and more of these emerging, disruptive viruses now  —   it’s a sign of changes in ecology, as the ecosystems change from climate shifts or increased mobility. ” Last July, two years after a big outbreak of chikungunya virus in South America, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases held a conference in Rockville on “Gaps and Opportunities in Chikungunya Research. ” In a hallway during a break, a physician from Brazil, Roberto Jose da Silva Badaro, made it his business to find Graham. Chikungunya was indeed rampant and troublesome, Badaro said, but something new had cropped up in his region. Chikungunya and dengue fever in Brazil    Dr. Barney Graham, Deputy Director, Vaccine Research Center Chief, Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory and Translational Science Core, is leading a lab that is investigating a Zika DNA vaccine candidate for the virus at the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center on the campus of National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. (Jared Soares for The Washington Post)  All spring, patients in Bahia and neighboring Brazilian states had been coming down with rash and mild fever, but the symptoms were not quite the same as those from other   viruses. Brazilian doctors wondered if they were seeing measles, rubella, West Nile, Mayaro virus or an adverse reaction to some vaccine. By late spring, the number of Zika cases in Bahia was tripling every week. At neighborhood clinics, people waited for hours to see a doctor. A medical team led by a virologist at the Federal University of Bahia, Gubio Soares, isolated the Zika virus. They rushed to tell authorities, including Badaro, Bahia’s vice minister of health. Over the summer, doctors began to see a spike in   syndrome, a condition marked by temporary paralysis. In the second half of last year, the state recorded nearly 140 cases, seven times higher than normal. Hospitals scrambled to find enough   beds for all the patients. “It was a war,” Badaro says. The battle continues: Some pregnant women have left Brazil, heading for colder climates in Europe and the United States. Women have sought out illicit abortions, illegal in Brazil under almost all circumstances. Vendors in a downtown Rio market said Cytotec, a banned medication for stomach ulcers, is in high demand for home abortions. Some pregnant women choose to become virtual prisoners, refusing to leave home except for emergencies. “You guys are discussing something that’s really in the past,” Badaro told U. S. researchers. “What’s coming is the Zika virus. ” Bahia, he told them, had already seen 63, 000 Zika cases. Graham had heard of Zika  —   he knew it had been discovered in Africa in the 1940s, and that there’d been an outbreak in the South Pacific a few years ago, but he’d not heard of it causing alarming symptoms. Graham and his colleagues soon started grabbing researchers off other projects. “When we see a virus spreading like that, we take notice,” Graham says. “People like Dr. Badaro are the sentinel. He was looking for chikungunya, and he found Zika. ”    Dr. Wei Shin sequences DNA as part of an investigation for a Zika vaccine candidate at the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda. (Jared Soares for The Washington Post)  Spring 2007: A spreading rash For hours each night, the “nonstop Micronesian beat” of V6AI, the only radio station in the island nation of Yap, transmits an endless loop of public service announcements warning residents to “sleep under   bed nets” and empty open containers where mosquitoes might breed. Mosquito bites used to be just a nuisance, a small price to pay for living in South Pacific paradise. But in 2007, Zika hit Yap with a powerhouse punch  —   an alien virus zapping an isolated population in a place with few defenses against the bug. But in little more than a year after it first hit Yap in spring of 2007, Zika  —   named after the forest in Uganda where the virus was discovered in 1947  —   infected about 7, 000 of the island’s 11, 000 residents. Most people had mild symptoms or none at all. Doctors thought they were seeing dengue, but the symptoms weren’t quite right. They called in   experts from the CDC and WHO. Lab tests determined the culprit: Zika. “We probably didn’t pick it up till the third or fourth week,” says James Edilyong, a Yap native who is chief of staff at Yap State Hospital. People streamed into the hospital, but “really, we had nothing we could do for them. ” Andy Choor, 32, thought he had a cold, maybe a light flu. His temperature flared, his appetite waned. Everywhere around him, “people were going down. You almost knew who had it because they were down for three or four days, and you just didn’t see them,” he recalls. Choor, who owns a souvenir and crafts shop, felt Zika’s impact at the cash register: Tourists  —   lifeblood of the island’s economy  —   became scarce. Life on the island changed. People who had never really cared about bug bites were now staying inside more. Things seemed quieter, more subdued. “It was alarming, and people are still concerned,” he says, even though the virus has largely vanished from the island.   [How a tiny mosquito became one of the world’s ‘most efficient killers’]   Edilyong, 48, was among the first in Yap to get Zika. “I’ve had the privilege to have both Zika and dengue, and dengue was much worse,” he says. His Zika rash lasted only a few hours; the aches resolved themselves within a day. From Yap, Zika made its way 5, 000 miles east to French Polynesia in 2013 and on to Japan the next year. After so many microcephalic babies were born in Brazil, doctors in the Pacific islands went back to see if they had missed a spike in birth defects. The results are inconclusive  —   in Polynesia, there had been an unusual number of malformations of the central nervous system in babies and miscarried fetuses, but the numbers were not large enough to cause alarm, and a connection to Zika remains unproven. Yap saw no such cluster of defects, Edilyong says: “Whatever happened to Zika to cause the defects in Brazil hadn’t happened when the virus was active here. ” In Yap and Polynesia, Zika seemed to burn through in less than a year. No cases have been reported since the outbreak faded, doctors said. How   environmental factors help spread Zika and other diseases The fear hasn’t gone away, but the hope that life can be normal again has returned. “We never had a panic about it,” Edilyong says. “But people became more anxious after other countries got the outbreak, after we heard about the birth defects. We get the word out about what to do, how to help prevent the spread. We talk to the chiefs, and the message goes right to the villages. And we get people to clean up their yards and empty water containers. We’re okay, we watch out for each other. ” March 2016: Race against risk Kim Conley runs to get to Rio. She runs for the satisfaction of knowing that she’s given it her all. “Really, it’s for the afterglow,” she says, “the feeling of the effort. ” She feels a fire, a will that is evident in her steely blue eyes, her zest for the daily punishment she endures, and now in her willingness to take a chance. Until someone in authority tells her otherwise, she’s determined to outrun the danger. She has to believe she can beat an opponent named Zika. Fisher reported from Sacramento and Washington; Partlow from Brazil; and Jordan from Colombia. Julie Tate in Washington and Anna Kaiser in Brazil contributed to this report.

"       On Thursday, Donald Trump, with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, press secretary Hope Hicks and son Donald Trump Jr. sat down at the     Trump International Hotel in Washington with reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. It was, as you might expect, fascinating. The transcript is below.  I annotated it using Genius. To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript; if you would like to leave your own annotations, make sure you have a Genius account.  BOB WOODWARD: And the real first question is, where do you start the movie of your decision to run for president? Because that is a big deal. A lot of   stuff, and we’d love to hear your monologue on how you did it. DONALD TRUMP: Where do you start the movie? I think it’s actually  —   and very interesting question  —   but I think the start was standing on top of the escalator at Trump Tower on June 16, which is the day  —   Bob, you were there, and you know what I mean, because there has. . . . I mean, it looked like the Academy Awards. I talk about it. There were so many cameras. So many  —   it was packed. The atrium of Trump Tower, which is a very big place, was packed. It literally looked like the Academy Awards. And . . .  . BW: But we want to go before that moment. DT:   Before that? Okay, because that was really . . .  . BW: Because, other words, there’s an internal Donald with Donald. ROBERT COSTA: Maybe late 2014 or before you started hiring people? DT: Well, but that was  —   okay, but I will tell you, until the very end. . . . You know, I have a good life. I built a great company. It’s been amazingly  —   I’m sure you looked at the numbers. I have very little debt, tremendous assets. And great cash flows. I have a wonderful family. Ivanka just had a baby. Doing this is not the easiest thing in the world to do. People have  —   many of my friends, very successful people, have said, ”Why would you do this?” BW: So is there a linchpin moment, Mr. Trump, where it went from maybe to yes, I’m going to do this? And when was that? DT: Yeah. I would really say it was at the beginning of last year, like in January of last year. And there were a couple of times. One was, I was doing a lot of deals. I was looking at very seriously one time, not  —   they say, oh, he looked at it for many  —   I really, no. I made a speech at the end of the ’80s in New Hampshire, but it was really a speech that was, it was not a political speech. But because it happened to be in New Hampshire . . .  . BW: And that guy was trying to draft you. DT: And he was a very nice guy. But he asked me. And he was so intent, and I made a speech. It was not a political speech, anyway, and I forgot about it.    Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sat down with The Post’s Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. Here are five surprising statements he made during their meeting. (The Washington Post)   BW: And that was the real possibility? Or the first . . .  . DT: Well no, the real possibility was the Romney time, or the Romney term. This last one four years ago. I looked at that, really. I never looked at it seriously then. I was building my business, I was doing well. And I went up to New Hampshire, made a speech. And because it was in New Hampshire, it was sort of like, Trump is going to run. And since then people have said, Trump is going to run. I never was interested. I could almost say at all, gave it very little thought, other than the last time, where Romney was running. And I thought that Romney was a weak candidate. I thought that  —   I thought Obama was very beatable. Very, very beatable. You know, you had a president who was not doing well, to put it nicely. And I looked at that very seriously. I had some difficulty because I was doing some big jobs that were finishing up, which I wanted to do. My children were younger. And four years makes a big difference. And I also had a signed contract to do ”The Apprentice” with NBC. Which in all fairness, you know, sounds like  —   when you’re talking about “president” it doesn’t sound much, but when you have a   show, prime time, every once a week on a major network . . .  . BW: So when did it go to yes? DT:  So  —   okay. BW: Because that’s  —   having made, you know, we all make minor decisions in our lives. DT: Okay. BW: This is the big one. DT:  Big decision. Yeah, this is a big decision. And I say, sometimes I’ll say it in the speeches. It takes guts to run for president, especially if you’re not a politician, you’ve never . . .  . BW: When did it become yes? DT: What happened is, during that time that I was just talking about, I started saying I’d like to do it, but I wasn’t really in a position to do it. I was doing a lot of things, and I had a signed contract with NBC. But I started thinking about it. And the press started putting me in polls, and I was winning in the polls. In fact, the day before, I was on ”Meet the Press” the day before I announced I wasn’t going to do it, and I got signed for another two years of ”The Apprentice” and everything else. Which, by the way, I don’t know if you saw, but ”The Apprentice” is a big thing. I made two hundred . . .  . BW: You made a lot of money. DT: Yeah. You were shocked. Remember this crazy man, Lawrence O’Donnell  —   he’s a total crazy nut  —   he said, Donald Trump only made a million dollars with ”The Apprentice.” I said, ”A million dollars?” You know, when you have a show that’s essentially number one almost every time it goes on, you can name it. . . . So anyway, when they added it all up  —   and these are certified numbers, because you have to do certified numbers  —   it came out to $213 million. Okay? That’s what I made on ”The Apprentice.” That’s just  —   and that’s one of my small things. That’s what I made. You know? So it was put at $213 million, and it was certified. And your friend Joe in the morning said, ”There’s no way he only made. . . .” They had a big fight, and O’Donnell, Lawrence O’Donnell started crying. I never saw anything like it. Do you remember? He started crying. [Laughter] He actually started crying. But that shows the level of hatred that people have. But what happened is, I made  —   I had a very, very successful show. And they put me in polls, and I was essentially leading right at the top, without doing any work. Not one speech, not one anything. But any time I was in a poll, I did very well in the poll. Anyway, I decided not to do it. NBC called and Mark Burnett would call, and I did see if I could get out. I had another year on the contract. Because you’re not allowed, because of the equal time, you’re not allowed to have a show . . .  . RC: What happened between 2011 and 2014? DT: Well, that’s what  —   I mean. . . . Between 2011 and 2014? I would say, just thought process. Only thought process. HOPE HICKS: A lot of deals. DT:  Yeah, I mean, I was doing  —   but in terms of this, only thought process. So what happened, but during this period of time, I said, you know, this is something I really would like to do. I think I’d do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me, because without any . . .  . BW: Who are you saying that to? Your wife? DT: To myself. BW: To your family? DT: To my family, but to myself. BW: To yourself. DT:    Yeah, to myself, and . . .  . BW: This is interior dialogue. DT: This is thought process. And I’m saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I’m number one. In fact, I said, I’m probably the only person ever to announce I’m not going to run for president when I’m number one in the polls. Because I remember the week that I announced that I wasn’t going to run and that I was going to  —   that basically NBC extended me for quite a period of time. And the week . . .  . Oh, this is my son Don. Bob and Bob. DONALD TRUMP JR.: I know. At least I know one Bob. How are you? [Introductions] DT: So during  —   and I spoke to Don, I spoke to my children about it. But during this period of time, I said, you know, I think I could probably do very well if I did it. But I didn’t do it because of contractual obligations, because I was finishing up things. Actually, this is one of the things right now. This started afterward. This started, we’re actually a year and a half ahead of schedule and under budget on this hotel. So what happened, Bob, what happened is . . .  . But during this period, I started really thinking during this period of time. And then Romney was a very, very failed and flawed candidate. He did a very poor job. Because I always felt that was a race that should’ve been won. I think in many respects that’s an easier race than the race you have now. And Romney did a poor job. And we all go back to work. Then about a year before June 16  —   that’s the day that I announced  —   I started really thinking about it very, very strongly. But the show continued to do very well. You know, 14 seasons, that’s a long time. But it continued to do very well. BW: Can you isolate a moment when it kicked to yes? DT: Well, I’ll tell you a moment. BW: Because that’s what Bob and I are looking for. DT: I’ll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. So you saw that it made a lot of money because it was certified. Now it’s much more, because I also have a big chunk of the show. We chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. Okay? And hopefully Arnold will do well; who knows? But there was a moment in, I would say, February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast  —   the head  —   came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract. And I said, ”Steve, I think that I am going to run for president. And if I do that, I’m not allowed to have a show.” In fact, when I did ”Saturday Night Live” recently, it was a whole big deal. I’m not allowed to be on, and they actually had to give certain periods of time to other candidates that were running. It was a whole big . . .  . So. I disagree with the equal time provisions. I think they’re very unfair. But nevertheless, you have them. So I said, ”Steve, I can’t have a show if I run. I can’t be having a show, so I’m not going to run.” He says, ”No, no, no, you’re going to do it.” I said, ”Steve, I’m going to.” And they actually went to the upfronts and they announced that ”The Apprentice”  —   in fact, you had a problem with it, because you were hearing that I was going to run, and then they announce that they’re going to renew ”The Apprentice” with Donald Trump. And I remember he called one of my people, maybe Hope. But he called one of my people and said, ”Wait a minute, he’s going to run, but he just announced he’s doing ’The Apprentice.’ ” Do you remember that problem? RC: Sure. I remember. DT: I didn’t announce it. It was NBC, they so wanted the show to be renewed. RC: But what we’ve never fully understood is about . . .  . Before that meeting with Burke, I’ve just never heard you talk about it in a vivid way. What was going through your mind about the country? With this moment in your life? That you said to yourself, ”I’m going to tell Burke I’m going to run for president.” DT: Well, okay. Sure. Okay. Prior to that, I just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country. In particular, because I’m a very natural person when it comes to business, I assume  —   I mean, I’ve done really well, and I do have an instinct for that  —   and I felt that we were doing some of the worst trade deals ever. And then you look at what’s going on in Iran with the beginning of negotiations of that disastrous deal. You know, look, it could’ve been a much better deal, Bob. They could’ve walked a couple of times. They could’ve doubled the sanctions for a couple of days and gotten the prisoners out early. They could’ve done so many things. To give the $150 billion back was terrible. So it was a terrible deal. It was a terrible negotiation. It was negotiated by people that are poor negotiators against great negotiators. Persians being great negotiators, okay? It’s one of those things. You might be Persian. But the Iranians, frankly, are great negotiators. The deal was a disaster. But I would see so many things. And it would make me angry. BW: What made you angriest? DT:  I would say in my case, more than anything else, the stupidity of the trade deals that we have with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with other . . .  . Because that’s something that I see. And I didn’t know that it would hit such a chord, because it’s hit a chord with a lot of . . .  . BW: So when did you tell somebody in your family or your circle, ”I’ve decided to run.” Other words, I’ve pulled the switch. DT: Well, I would tell my family about it all the time. Don is one of my sons, and doing a really good job. He’s involved very much in this job. . . . Don and my family, I would talk about it a lot. I would say, ”I can’t believe they’re doing it.” And another thing would happen. I own a big part of the Bank of America building in San Francisco [and]  1290 Avenue of the Americas. I got it from China. Meaning Chinese people had it. It was a big thing. It was a war, it was actually a war. BW: Did anyone recommend no? Did your wife, or did your son? DT: Oh. Yeah. BW: Did anyone say, ”Dad, Donald, don’t do it?” DT: I think my wife would much have preferred that I didn’t do it. She’s a very private person. She was a very, very successful  —   very, very successful model. She made a tremendous amount of money and had great success and dealt at the . . .  . BW: What’d she say? DT: She was, she said, we have such a great life. ”Why do you want to do this?” She was . . .  . BW: And what’d you say? DT: I said, ”I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.” Because it’s something I’d be  —   I could do such a great job. I really wanted to give something back. I don’t want to act overly generous, but I really wanted to give something back. BW: Well, that’s the important moment, when you say, I have to do it. DT:  Yeah, I had to. BW: That’s the product of the endless internal dialogue. DT: Well, she’s a very private person, and very smart person. I’m sure you’ve seen a couple of interviews that she’s done. She’s very smart. And there’s no games. You know, it’s boom, it’s all business. But a very smart person. And considered one of the great beauties. BW: Did she give you the green light? DT:  And she said, ”Why are we doing the . . .  .” Oh, absolutely. She said, ”If you want to do it, then you should do it, but . . .  .” And she actually said something that was very interesting. She’s very observant. And she would go around with me. And look, I’ve been around for a long time at a high level. That’s why you were up in my office in, I guess it was ’89, I can’t believe. So that might help you with your check. Check ’89, ’88. But I’ve been around a long time. She said, ”You know if you run, you’ll win.” I said, ”I don’t know if I’m going to win.” She said, ”If you run, you’ll win. But if you say you’re going to run, they’re never going to  —   people are not going to believe it.” Because people were let down the first time, I will tell you. They really wanted me to run, and I would’ve beaten Romney. They really  —   they wanted me to run that time. So for the most part, the polls didn’t include me. And then one poll included me, and I didn’t do that well. I was down at like 3 percent. I said to my wife, ”I don’t think I can run. I’m down at 3 percent.” Boy, that’s a long way to go up. And she goes, ”No, no, no, you’re only at 3 percent because they don’t believe you’re running. If they thought you were going to run . . .  .” I said,”No, no, the poll said I’m going to run.” She said, ”No, no, they still don’t believe it.” It doesn’t matter what the poll says. The poll can say, you are going to run, Donald Trump is going to absolutely run. It was very interesting. Sort of like  —   I called her my pollster. She said, ”No, no, they won’t believe that. I don’t care if they put it in, if they put it at the top of your building, ’I’m going to run.’ They’re not going to believe it unless that you go out and announce that you’re going to run.” And she said, ”I hope you don’t do it, but if you run, you’ll win.” RC: So it was an evolution. Let’s turn to . .. DT: So it was an evolution. WOODWARD: Yeah. RC: Let’s turn to the presidency. You’re nearing the nomination . . .  . DT: And then the big thing, by the way, the big thing was standing at the top of that escalator, looking down into that room  —   which was a sea of reporters, of which he was one, but a sea  —   that was as big as anything we’ve had. And getting up and saying, all right. And I remember. I took a deep breath. I said, ”Let’s go,” to my wife. And you know, we came down. Pretty famous scene, the escalator scene. Boom. And we started, and we talked illegal immigration, and it became a very big subject, and that’s where we started. RC: As you near the nomination and you look ahead to the possibility of being president of the United States, how do you conceptualize presidential power? And how do you see the job of president? This is something that’s nearing, right now, for you. DT: Okay. So first of all, I have to get there. Because I view it as a highly competitive process. I’ve been, it’s very interesting, I’ve done very well up until now. I’ve taken out a lot of people. We had 17 people. RC: Let’s say you’re the president, though. How do you see the office of the presidency? BW: Other words, what’s the definition of the job? DT: Okay. I think more than anything else, it’s the security of our nation. That’s always going to be  —   that’s number one, two and three. After that, many things come into focus. It’s health, it’s health care. It’s jobs. It’s the economy. But number one  —  and I say number one, two, three  —   is the security of the country. The military, being strong, not letting bad things happen to our country from the outside. And I certainly think that that’s always going to be my number one part of that definition. BW: Any . . .  . Before coming over, Bob and I have had lots of chats. And we were thinking about this, that you are running for the nomination in the Republican Party. DT: Right. BW: Which is the party of Lincoln and the party of Nixon. . . . And so we have this party that you are running to be the nominee in, and it’s got two heritages. Lincoln and Nixon. DT: That’s true. That’s true. BW: And why did Lincoln succeed? Thought about that at all? DT: Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time. And Nixon failed, I think to a certain extent, because of his personality. You know? It was just that personality. Very severe, very exclusive. In other words, people couldn’t come in. And people didn’t like him. I mean, people didn’t like him. BW: And he broke the law. DT: And he broke the law, yeah. Yeah. He broke the law. Whether that’s insecurity . . .  . BW: I mean, you listen to those tapes, and he’s a criminal. DT: Yeah. Whether that’s  —   right. And he broke the law. BW: And time and time again, break in, get the FBI on this, get the IRS on. DT: Sure. Sure. BW: I mean, it is an appalling legacy of criminality. DT: Right. BW: And at the end, the day he resigned, an amazing day, he gives that speech which is kind of free association about mom and dad. DT:    Right. BW: He’s sweating. And then he said, “Always remember: Others may hate you, but those who hate you don’t win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself. ” The piston was hate. DT: Well, and he was actually talking very much about himself, because ultimately, ultimately, that is what destroyed him. Hate is what destroyed him. And such an interesting figure. I mean, you would know that better than anybody. But such an interesting figure. And such a man of great talent. I mean, Nixon had great potential, great talent. Unfortunately it was a very sad legacy in the end. It turned out to be a very sad legacy. Such an interesting figure to study. I think. . . . BW: Do you take any lessons from that? Because what did is he converted the presidency to an instrument of personal revenge. DT:    Yeah. BW: You’re my enemy, I’m going to get you. I’m going to get    on you. DT:  Yeah. No, I don’t. I don’t see that. What I do see is  —   what I am amazed at is, I’m somebody that gets along with people. And sometimes I’ll notice, I’ll be, I have the biggest crowds. Actually we’ve purposefully kept the crowds down this past week. You know, we’ve gone into small venues and we’re turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn’t want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2, 000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters. When you have 21 or 25, 000 people coming in, people can start standing up and screaming. What has been amazing to me  —   I’m a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans  —   you just said hello to Senator Sessions. Cruz and everybody wanted Senator Sessions as much as they’ve wanted anybody, and he’s a highly respected guy, great guy. And we have some —   and he endorsed me. We have some amazing endorsements, some amazing people, but I’m amazed at the level of animosity toward me by some people. I’m amazed. RC: But you’re going to have to overcome that, Mr. Trump, if you’re going to be the nominee and the president. DT:  I think you may be right. I think you may be right. RC:  I think this is such a pivot moment for you. DT: Okay. RC: You’re nearing the nomination. The presidency is possible. How do you  —   you say you get along with all these people. How do you . . .  . DT: No, I say in my life I’ve gotten along with people. RC: Understood. DT: This is the first time where I’ve had this. RC: How do you expand your reach right now? How are you going to do this at this moment in the country, where there’s all this anger that you’re talking about? You think there’s a lot of animus toward yourself. How do you expand your reach, your appeal, right now? DT: Well, let me tell you the biggest problem that I have. And I talk about it a lot. I get a very unfair press. I’m somebody that’s a person that understands when I say  —   when I say, I say what I say. But I really do get a very, very unfair press. And a lot of times I’ll be making a speech, as an example, in front of a  —   in Orlando, where you have 20, 25, 000 people show up in the sun at 3  in the afternoon in an open venue. And I will be saying things, and Bob, it won’t be reported what I say. It will be reported so differently. RC:  So how do you  —   so regardless of your view of the press, how do you navigate the . . .  . DT:   Well, the problem with my view of the . . .  . RC:  The candidate has to get beyond all these different obstacles. DT:  No, you’re right, but if the press would report what I say, I think I would go a long way to doing that. Now, there is a natural bias against me because I’m a businessperson, I’m not in the club. Okay? You understand that. I’m not in the club. I’m not a senator, I’m not a politician. I’m not somebody that’s been in Congress for 25 years, and I know everybody, I’m somebody  —   I’m very much an outsider. I am also somebody that’s   my campaign, other than small contributions. BW: But the press likes outsiders. I mean . . .  . DT:  But the press doesn’t like me. For the most part. BW: And would you blame the problem on the press, on the media coverage? DT:  No, I, but I think . . . I do say this: My media coverage is not honest. It really isn’t. And I’m not saying that as a person with some kind of a complex. I’m just saying, I will be saying words that are written totally differently from what I’ve said. And I see it all  —   in all fairness, the editorial board of The Washington Post. I was killed on that. I left the room, I thought it was fine. RC:  But what are some concrete steps you could take right now to project a bigger presence, a more unifying presence? Regardless of your view of the press, which is noted. How do you take steps now to really become a nominee? DT:  Well, I think  —   it’s a great question, and it’s a question I’ve thought about a lot. I mean, I think the first thing I have to do is win. Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left. We started off with 17 people. I have two people left. And one of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary. And it’s almost impossible to reel them back. . . .  So [a famous athlete] calls me up about a month ago, right after I beat Rubio. And I beat him by 20 points. That was a big beating. Don’t forget, he was the face of the Republican Party. He was the future of the Republican Party. So [he] called me up. And he said, “Hey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don’t kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back. ” You know, you may need them when you go to phase 3, or whatever phase you’re looking . . .  . BW: Because here’s what  —   what Bob Costa and I were talking about, and we appreciate this moment to really get into these things. DT: I just thought it was a great . . .  . You know, especially . . .  . BW: No, no, exactly. Having done this, reporting, so many years  —   too many decades  —   that I’ve thought about, what’s politics? All politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building. DT:  It’s true. BW: Do you agree? DT:  I do. I agree. I agree. BW: And if you look . . .  . DT: But I think you have to break the egg initially. In other words, I agree with you, but when you’re coming from where I’m coming from  —   I came from the outside. By the way, I was establishment. I was an establishment guy until I said I’m running. And then when I said I don’t want anyone’s money, that drove everyone . . .  . I mean, outside of the small contributions, you know, the stuff. . . . But  —   because  —   and even  —   the reason for the small  —   we get lots of little contributions. What does it amount to? Six, 7 million dollars? And we sell paraphernalia, we sell the Trump shirt and the Trump hat, little stuff. But it still amounted to like 6 million dollars, seven. But I’m in for about $35 million. But I don’t want any money. Bob, I have turned down  —   I would have made  —   Bush had $148 million. I would’ve had five times that much if I wanted to take it. BW: But you said it: Sometimes you have to break an egg. DT:  Sometimes you have to break an egg. BW: And haven’t you broken enough eggs? DT: Well, if that’s the question, I think I have two more left. BW: And . . .  . Okay, but at this point of  —   as you  —   Bob Costa, from his perspective of knowing the Republican Party . . . and the question is, how do you   how do you unbreak those eggs? DT: So that’s the question. RC: I was struck by your comments about Senator Cruz. It seems like you’re not working as much as I would’ve thought to bring the party together. DT:  I’m looking to win first. I really believe that once . . .  . My life has been about victories. I’ve won a lot. I win a lot. I win  —  when I do something, I win. And even in sports, I always won. I was always a good athlete. And I always won. In golf, I’ve won many club championships. Many, many club championships. And I have people that can play golf great, but they can’t win under pressure. So I’ve always won. BW: But Bob’s question is right at the heart of this. Because you said about Senator Cruz, I don’t want his support. DT:    Oh, is that what you’re referring to? BW: Yeah. And he is, whatever you may think of him, and whatever battles you’ve had, he represents the Reagan conservative . . .  . DT:    No, I don’t think he represents Reagan. RC: Some people think he does. BW: That’s how he’s selling himself. DT: Okay. Well, maybe now how he’s selling himself. BW: That’s perceived. And if you’re going to be the nominee, you need the conservatives in the party. DT: Yeah. Well, but I also need the outside people, and I’m definitely now the outsider. Cruz is interesting. We got along very well. BW: Initially? DT:  I would make provocative statements, and he would say, ”I agree with Mr. Trump.” I mean, he was above all. But I kept saying, ”I wonder when he will attack.” Because ultimately, assuming . . .  . Because I’ve been at the center of the dais from day one. And even the other day, NBC came out with a poll, I’m at 48 to  . You know, that’s a national poll. So what happened is he was, could not have been more supportive. And in fact, he made a speech, he was making a big speech in Washington, and he didn’t have that many people going. And he called me and he said, ”Would it be possible for you to come?” I made it outside of the capital, right in front of the capital, and I came and a tremendous number of people came and it was very successful. We shook hands and I left and that was that. But I got along with Cruz, Cruz, great. But I always said, Bob, and you were there, I said, at some point, this is going to end. Because people would say, you’re the only two. RC:  Right. And at some point the nomination battle ends. DT: Yeah. And at some point the nomination. RC: Maybe I’m mishearing you, but I feel like you’re almost comfortable being the Lone Ranger. DT: I am. Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I’m the Lone Ranger. And I said the other day  —   I watched Cruz as he tried to be as politically correct as he could be. And they say, well, will you support? And I watched him during the debate, and he said yes, and Rubio said yes, and everybody said yes. Because that was the thing to do. We have to support the party. But I watched him struggling the other day, struggling so hard, to not use the word “no” when asked about will he support Donald Trump. At the same time, not wanting to  —   wishing the question wasn’t asked. Because he didn’t want to do anything that would be offensive to the party, let’s say, and to standard politics. BW: Can I just say for . . .  . DT: But Bob, what I told him. .. BW: Yes sir. DT: What I said is that, I watched that, and I said, look, he doesn’t have to support me. It really doesn’t matter. I don’t want to make his life difficult. BW: But can you be president and be Lone Ranger? DT: Um . . .  . BW: I mean, as we were talking about Lincoln  —   if we may. DT:    Yeah. BW: Lincoln’s second inaugural, he’s won the war, he has broken more eggs than any president ever. DT: He broke a lot of eggs. BW: And he comes out and in his second inaugural he said, “Malice toward none, charity for all, bind up the nation’s wounds. ” DT: Right. BW: Other words, he’s saying, let’s go back and   between the North and the South. Isn’t that a moment you’re going to have to face? DT: Totally, totally. BW: Or is that not right now, this moment? DT:  I don’t think it’s now. BW: You don’t? DT: No, because I think I have to win before I can do that. Look, I’ve had. .. BW: Might that not assist in the winning? DT:  No, because you have two people that want to win also, and they’re not going to be changing their ways. RC: What does it look like, though, when you pivot to the general election? Let’s say you win the nomination. How does that   that unity message  —   what does that look like? How is Trump the unifier different than Trump the primary battler? DT: Okay. As you know, certain polls have me beating Hillary Clinton, but I haven’t focused on Hillary Clinton yet. Okay? And I say that all the time. I have not focused on her.  I’ve only focused on the people that are ahead of me, and right now I have two people. I don’t have to think about whether it’s going to be Hillary or somebody else. I’d love your view on what’s going to happen with Hillary from the other standpoint, okay? Because that’s really going to be a very interesting question. And it seems to be heating up, which is almost a little surprising, because it looked to me like she’s being protected. But my family said to me  —   and Don has said this, and Ivanka, and my wife has said this  —   ”Be more presidential.” Because I can be very presidential. I jokingly say, I can be more presidential than any president that this country has ever had except for Abraham Lincoln, because he was [unclear]. Right? You can’t   Abraham Lincoln. BW: Isn’t that what people want to see now? DT: Yeah. Yeah, but they said. .. Yes. BW: In the Republican Party, I mean . . . there is a lot of angst and rage and distress. DT: A lot.  . BW:  . DT: I bring. .. BW: And you have to tame that rage, don’t you? DT: Yes, yes, but I bring that out in people. I do. I’m not saying that’s an asset or a liability, but I do bring that out. BW: You bring what out? DT: I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was . . .  . I don’t know if that’s an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I’ve had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they’ve ever met. And after it’s all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here. But when my wife and Ivanka and the rest of my family, for the most part  —   Tiffany, my daughter, she’s a very smart young woman, she’s up at University of Pennsylvania doing great  —   and she said to me the same thing. BW: Be presidential? DT: Be presidential. Now . . .  . BW: When did they start saying this to you? DT: Well, they really started saying it before the last debate. The last debate. And if you noticed, my attitude was much different in the last debate, okay? But I said, wait a minute. According to every single  —   you know, Drudge, and all of the polls, they do these online  —   they have polls for everything. They do debate polls. And you know what I’m talking about. RC: Sure. DT: Hundreds of thousands of people vote. I won every single debate. Every single debate. And I was rough and I was nasty. And I was treated nastily by the other side too. And then Rubio went, you know, Rubio went Don Rickles on me, and all of a sudden he became cute and he started getting extremely nasty. And I had to get even nastier to him. Now, what happened  —  and then started with the Little Marco. Come on, Little Marco. Little Marco over here said this and that. And he didn’t want to  —   he didn’t stop that, he didn’t stop that because he was told, oh, he should stop. He stopped that because I was outdoing him. But here’s the thing. BW: We understand the history of this. We followed. DT: Right, but here’s the thing. RC: So is it . . .  . DT: Wait. RC: Sure. DT: Okay, so my family comes up. Don. My daughter Tiffany, who’s a great kid. Ivanka. My wife. And we were together. They said, ”Be presidential, Dad, be presidential.” Last debate. I said, wait a minute. If I get hit, I’m going to hit back. That’s not going to look very presidential, because I hit back and you hit back. I said, I’m going to give it a shot. And I was actually  —   you know, the last debate was actually a much different debate . . .  . RCO: Right. DT: In terms of my tone. And I actually got my highest ratings on that debate. RC: But I’m just struck by  —   we’re asking the questions about being presidential. So many other people have asked, can Trump pivot, can he shift to a different kind of tone? And correct me if I’m wrong, but my view, listening to you, is you actually don’t really have that much interest in changing too much. DT: Not yet. Not yet. RC: But it seems your natural inclination is to fight . . .  . DT:    No. RC:    No? DT:  My  —   yes, always to fight. My natural inclination is to win. And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won’t even recognize me. You’ll be falling asleep, you’ll be so bored. BW: Really. But when Ted Cruz said what he said, and then you said, I don’t need his support. DT: I don’t need his support. I don’t believe I need it. BW: Now, what would your family say to you? DT:  Well, what I said is, I don’t need his . . .  . BW: What would a president say? What would Reagan say? What would Lincoln say if the opposition came and said whatever they said, and then you said  . . .  . DT: Well Bob . . .  . BW:  Hey, look, we are going to bind up  . . .  . DT: Yeah. BW: Not the nation’s wounds at this point, the party’s . . .  . RC: You think maybe you do need Cruz’s support? Maybe you do need it at some point. DT: I don’t think  —   I have the people’s support. I have a tremendous group. And by the way, let me just, before we get off that one  —   because you were saying about Cruz  —   it wasn’t like he embraced me. BW: No, he didn’t. DT:  It wasn’t like he said, oh, I will endorse Donald Trump. He is so wonderful, and if I don’t make it he is somebody that I think would be fantastic. Well, he didn’t exactly say that, Bob. He said . . .  . He was pained having to answer the question. BW: Right. DT: So it wasn’t like I’m saying, I don’t want his support, as he says great things about me. So I had no guilt whatsoever saying it. I do believe it. BW: Do you think you’re going to be at a point where you’re going to have to call him and say, ”Ted, I need you?” DT: I’ll never have to call him. I may be at a point where I call him, but I never will . . .  . BW: And what would you say? If you won the nomination, would you call him and say . . .  . DT: I would call him to say congratulations on a great job. Because out of 17 people, you beat 16. Okay? Which is pretty good, to put it mildly. You know, we had a lot of talent. When I first ran, and this is where I had some doubts, because what do I know? I didn’t know most of these people. Although I’d been very political. I’d given a lot of money. I gave $350, 000 last year to the Republican Governors Association. I was a member of the establishment, if you think about it, and very high standing because of . . .  . BW: Could you say to Ted Cruz, ”Ted, the   is going to begin right now. I need your support and help and advice?” DT: I don’t think I’d say it that way, but I would be able . . .  . BW: How would you say it? DT:  . . . to get along with some of the people that I was competing against. Now, I will say this: Some of the people that I was competing against, I’m not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb. I was told when I first started that Jeb was the preemptive favorite. He was going to  . . .  . RC: Right. But you don’t have a strategy for these ”Never Trump” people? You would think if you’re the nominee, you would have to find a way to bring Bush into the fold, to bring a Rubio into the fold. DT:    I don’t think  —   look . . .  . RC: Do you have a strategy for that at all? DT: I think that’s overrated, what you’re saying, about bringing them into the fold. At the same time, I think I would be successful with many of them. I don’t know that I’ll be successful with Jeb Bush. RC:    Right. BW: How about Cruz? What would you say to him, Donald? DT: I think I would . . .  . BW: Because this is really  —   I think this . . .  . DT:  Yeah, I understand. BW: We get pivot points, and we’re going from a phase of . . .  . DT: I think Cruz and I could get along very well. I actually think so. We got along very well for six months. BW: Would you say, ”I need your support?” DT: We got along very well for six months when I was attacking everybody. BW: Right. But now you’re going to have to reach out to him, aren’t you, if this is going to work? DT: Well, we’ll have to see what happens. I don’t think now, Bob, because he wants to win and I want to win. And I guess Kasich wants to win, although Kasich’s only won one out of 28, right? That’s not so good. RC: Our big picture is how Reagan in 1980 competed against George H. W. Bush in the primary, then put him on the ticket. DT: Yeah, and got along. And truly disliked each other. RC: And put him on the ticket. DT: Yeah. RC: Considers him to be part of the team, team of rivals. Could you have a team of rivals in a general election? DT: I would never want to say that now. Right now, I just want to win. And I don’t want to say who’s going to be  —   as an example, people are saying, you should pick    as vice president. It’s just too early for that. In my opinion, it’s too . . .   . RC:  You have a few names on your mind about VP? DT: I do. I do have names. RC: Can you share one or two? DT: I’d rather not do it now. RC: One or two? COREY LEWANDOWSKI: But Dr. Carson’s come to the campaign, and Chris Christie’s come to the campaign, and they were rivals in the past. And they said there was one person who we believe is going to make the country great again. DT:    Very good point. CL: And look, nobody hit Dr. Carson harder than Mr. Trump did. It was very fair, and he made a very impressive speech in Iowa. DT:  The only thing I did with Dr. Carson  —   because I respect him a lot  —   but I just talked about his book. Because he wrote things in his book, and all I did was quote from his book. Because, you know, it was tough stuff what he wrote about himself. He wrote about himself. It’s an amazing story. And he . . .  . BW: Without names . . . . DT:  . . . understands that. BW: . . . as vice president, what would be the role and responsibilities of your vice president, should you be elected, should you win the nomination? DT: Well, the number one role is to be a great president if something should happen. Okay? That’s always got to be the number one role for a vice president. After that, I would say, frankly, somebody that can help you get elected. And then thirdly, somebody that helps you with the Senate and with the House. So it would be a political person. In other words, I don’t need to have another great businessman come in and  —   I don’t need that. What I do . . .  . BW: Somebody who knows dreaded Washington, perhaps. DT:  Somebody that can walk into the Senate and who’s been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside. BW: And would that person be integral to the governing team you would have in the White House? Go to all meetings, have total access? DT: Yes, I would. . . . Sure. Sure. This would be a vice president  —   I would like to have somebody. . . . For instance, somebody like Ben Carson. When Ben Carson came to me  —   not necessarily vice president  —   but when he came to me, he called, he said, ”What you’re doing is amazing. It’s a movement. And you see that.” When I announce I’m going to go to Tampa three days before, and we go there three days later, there’s 25, 000 people in the stadium that houses the professional sports teams . . .   . RC: No, it says a lot that  —   you are acknowledging that you don’t want to have another outsider as part of your team. DT: Yeah. RC: You need an insider. DT: Somebody like Ben Carson, he never once said to me, could I have a position? RC: He doesn’t fit that model. DT:  No, no, he doesn’t. But he will be absolutely somebody that I’d love to have involved with us at a high level, at a very high level. Chris Christie. Chris called, he said, I’d love to be involved. And I said, that’s great. I’ve never been a big one for endorsements. Although Tom Brady loves me in New England; I think that’s why I got 50 percent. Okay? Tom Brady loves me. [Laughter] That helped. RC: So, sticking on this presidency theme for a second, I don’t think a lot of people know that much about how much you value discretion, loyalty within your business. DT: Great loyalty, yes. Great discretion, great loyalty. RC: But it’s different when you’re running the federal government. DT:  Well, it’s . . .  . RC:  And one thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements? DT:  I think they should. You know, when somebody  —   and I see it all the time. . . .  And I don’t know, there could be some kind of a law that you can’t do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don’t like that. I mean, I’ll be honest. And people would say, oh, that’s terrible, you’re taking away his right to free speech. Well, he’s going in. . . .  I would say . . . I do have nondisclosure deals. That’s why you don’t read that. . . . BW: With everyone? Corey has one, Hope has one. DT:  Corey has one, Hope has one. Did you sign one? HH: Of course. CL: Stephen [Miller, Trump’s policy adviser] has one. DT: Stephen has one. CL: [Donald Trump, Jr.] has one. DTJ.: I don’t have one. I’m in the middle of the book. [Laughter] CL: Don has two. [Laughter] DT: I know, I forgot, he’s the one I’m most worried about. DTJ: I’m not getting next week’s paycheck until I sign one. DT: I have a very, very, very prominent businessman who’s right now got a person  —   he’s involved in litigation, terrible litigation with somebody that worked for him in a very close level. And I said why are you . . .  . BW: Do you think these are airtight agreements? DT:    Yeah, totally. I think they’re very airtight. They’re very . . .  . BW: And that no one could write a book or . . .  . DT: I think they’re extremely airtight. And anybody that violated it  —    let’s put it this way: it’s so airtight that I’ve never had . . . you know, I’ve never had a problem with this sort of thing. BW: Let us ask this . . .  . DT:  By the way, this man called me, he said, how is it that you don’t have  —   as famous as you are? And I sent him a copy of the agreement. He said, this is genius. And he now has people that go to work for him. I don’t like people that take your money and then say bad things about you. Okay? You know, they take your . . .  . RC:  But it’s so different when you’re in the federal government. DT:  It’s different, I agree. It’s different. RC:  But you are recommending nondisclosure. .. DT: And I tell you this, I will have to think about it. I will have to think about it. That’s a different thing, that I’m running a private company and I’m paying people lots of money, and then they go out and. .. BW: The taxpayers are paying the other people in the federal government. DT:  Sure. Sure. They don’t do a great job, and then you fire them and they end up writing a book about you. So it’s different. But I will say that in the federal government it’s a different thing. So it’s something I would think about. But you know, I do right now  —   I have thousands and thousands of employees, many thousands, and every one of them has an agreement, has a . . .  I call it a confidentiality . . .  . BW: Say you’re elected president. Would one   term be enough? DT:  I would say the following: I have seen people make the statement for Senate and for other positions, government  —   because I’ve been a very political person over the years, I’ve gotten as many zone changes as any human being on earth, probably, including the entire West Side of Manhattan from 77nd Street to 59th Street. A very successful job. I would say that every time I see somebody make that statement and then they’re feeling good and doing a great job, and they run, they lose because of that statement. So I would never want to say that four years . . .  I would never want to limit myself to four years. I think I can do a tremendous job in four years. One of your questions, I noticed, is what would be your first 90 days in terms  —   and we’ll talk about that next. BW: Good. DT: But, so I think I can do a terrific job. And I think this: if I’m doing a terrific job, and if I’m feeling well, I would say I would continue to go for the extra four years. Because again, I don’t want to put that burden on myself. If I’m doing a good job, I should be allowed. And I only say that because you know, Bob, I’ve seen so many people say it. Even for local positions. And if they decide to then go, they always lose because they make that statement. So I don’t want to say that. But I think I will be able to do a fantastic job in four years. BW: Real quickly, at the Post editorial board interview, you referred to the $19 trillion in debt, and then you said the U. S. is “probably sitting on a bubble. ” DT: Yeah, a bubble. BW: What bubble? DT: Well, I think we’re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble. I think if you look at the stock market. .. BW: In the stock market you mean? DT: Yeah. BW: Or do you mean . . .  . DT: Well first of all, we’re not at five percent unemployment. We’re at a number that’s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians  —   and in particular presidents  —   look good. And I wouldn’t be getting the kind of massive crowds that I’m getting if the number was a real number. People are extremely unhappy in this country. BW: And so is the bubble  —   it’s not a housing bubble. DT:  No, no, I’m talking about . . . . BW: Or a real estate building bubble. DT:  I’m talking about a bubble where you go into a very massive recession. Hopefully not worse than that, but a very massive recession. Look, we have money that’s so cheap right now. And if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want. But I’m rich. If a person that wants to put a lot of people to.  . . .   And I don’t need the money. I don’t have to borrow. I don’t even call banks anymore. I use my own money to do things. If I want to borrow money or if another rich person wants to borrow money, you can borrow money at, like, LIBOR plus nothing. And you’re paying one and a half percent interest, it’s crazy, and they’ll give you all you want. If somebody is a great, wonderful person, going to employ lots of people, a really talented businessperson, wants to borrow money but they’re not rich? They have no chance. BW: Bubbles are scary to economists. DT: Oh, bubbles are scary. BW: Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, used to say, there may be a bubble out there but you don’t know it’s a bubble until it bursts. Is that true? DT: Yeah. That’s true. I think that’s true. I think you had a lot of signs, because you had all those exploding mortgages. I told . . .  . BW: And you say there are signs now. DT:  . . . people. BW: We’re “sitting on a bubble. ” DT: Okay, so I made many speeches for different groups on success, where people would pay me a lot of money, I gave it to charity. People would pay me money for speeches on success. So I would do that, before this. And I would tell people, don’t invest that, don’t go  —   I was pretty good at prognostication, at telling people what to do in terms of. . . . Now, I’d talk about success, but I’d say, this is a bad time to invest. I also said, this is a good time to invest. BW: What is it now? Is it a good time to invest now? DT: Oh, I think it’s a terrible time right now. BW: You really do? DT: Yeah. RC: Why is that? DT: Because the dollar is so strong. Our country is in  —   you know, it’s very interesting. There’s a couple of things good about strong dollars, but there’s some. .. BW: So your tip, stock tip, is to get out of the market? Or avoid it now? DT:  Oh, my stock tip is that the market  —   I believe we’re sitting on a big bubble. So you take a look at what’s going on. You have  —   think of it  —   you have cheap money that nobody can get unless you’re rich. You have the regulators are running the banks. Not the guys that are being paid $50 million a year to run the banks. I mean, when you look at many of your friends that are running banks that are being paid $40 and $50 million, yeah, they’re not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that’s a bad sign. That’s a sign of things to come. And yeah, I think we’re sitting on a very, very big bubble. BW: So the Wall Street people are going to  —   when we publish this  —   are not going to like to hear the possible president say . . . . DT:  Yeah, I don’t care about the. . . .  I know the Wall Street people. I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. You know, the Wall Street . . .  . BW: You don’t need them either? DT:  No. No. You know, I don’t need them. No, other candidates need them, by the way. Ted Cruz needs them. Ted Cruz borrowed millions of dollars for his [  committees]. BW: But doesn’t this go back to the coalition? I’m sorry. DT: And by the way, and didn’t disclose on his personal financials that he was borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank and didn’t  —   and paying almost no interest. He had an interest rate that you would’ve been proud to have, and he didn’t disclose it. Which nobody made a big deal out of. You did a little bit. But no I do, I think we’re sitting  —   it’s precarious times. Part of the reason it’s precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody’s ever going to stop it. And the reason they’re not going to stop it is one of two. They’re either living in a world of the make believe, or they’re totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests. Meaning people that want it to continue. Because what China, what Mexico, what Japan  —   I don’t want to name too many countries, because I actually do business in a lot of these countries  —   but what these countries are doing to us is unbelievable. They are draining our jobs. They are draining our money. They are taking the money out . . . . BW: So you are really pessimistic, to say the least? DT: I’m pessimistic. Unless changes are made. Changes could be made. BW: Could you fix it? Next year, if you became president? DT:  Yes, I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly. BW: Okay. Tell us that. DT:  When I was at your editorial board meeting, I talked about NATO. And I’m not a world expert on NATO. But I have a natural instinct for certain things, okay? Like I said, keep the oil. Well, now ISIS has the oil. I said a lot of things. I said in my book about  —   written in 2000  —   mentioned Bin Laden in a paragraph or two. And that was two years before the World Trade Center came down. And I’m not a politician, I was . . .  . RC:  So what’s your instinct, your plan, for let’s say first 100 days, how you turn this all around? DT: Okay, well, I say this. Look: We are making, and we have, some of the worst trade deals in the history of trade. We’re now making one,   Partnership. TPP. A disaster, that deal is a disaster. BW: You know lots of experts, supposedly, disagree with you on the trade issues and so forth. Feel . . .  . DT: Yeah. Oh, I was against NAFTA. BW: And there’s a lot of analysis, and a lot of data. DT: I was against NAFTA. NAFTA’s been a disaster. I mean, frankly, I’m a big Ronald Reagan fan, but I disagreed with him on trade. I thought his trade policies were terrible. BW: So the first 100 days, what would you do? DT: Okay. I would do a number of things. I would, number one, I would start negotiating great trade deals using  —   I know the best people. You know. . . . BW: You think that can turn around in 100 days? DT:  No, no, it can’t, no, but I would start the negotiation. No, these are complicated transactions. Part of the problem with the TPP is it’s 12 countries. Okay? And you should do individual country deals. It’s 7, 000 pages long. And each one of those countries has studied this thing, photographic. We have congressmen, they don’t even read these agreements. RC:  But this is a  —   that would be driven out of the executive branch, that kind of negotiation. DT: Yeah. It’s a bad deal. It’s a bad deal for our country. RC: What about legislation? What about economic legislation? DT: Well, I know, but it’s a bad deal for our country. What I would do  —   and before I talk about legislation, because I think frankly this is more important  —   number one, it’s going to be a very big tax cut. Because the middle class has been. . . . And Larry Kudlow and numerous people have liked very much. . . . You know, I put in a plan for tax cuts, and I’ve gotten some very good reviews. I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we’re the   nation in the world. But I would start  —   because I noticed your question briefly  —   boom, what would you do in the first 90 days? I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. And they have been for years. It’s an incredible tribute to our country that we can lose billions  —   hundreds of billions  —   of dollars consistently, year in and year out  —   and still even survive. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt it. I mean, you look at what’s going on in China. We have rebuilt China  . Now, they’ve done okay with Europe too, but . . .  . RC: So renegotiate trade deals and have a tax cut. That would be your first 100 days? DT: Renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals. RC: Real quick on trade deals. .. DT: And by the way, and renegotiate with NATO. And renegotiate with Japan and with. .. RC: On trade deals, dealing with a company, on your business deals, when you study them, it’s dealing with people and corporations. DT: And I’m negotiating over 100 deals. We’re negotiating 114 deals. RC: But aren’t deals with countries and foreign leaders different than the kind of transactions you do at the corporate level? And how do you make that transition? DT: No. RC: Because you can’t say to a country, I’m going to sue you. DT:  No. Well, you know, it depends on what your definition of “sue” is. We will be able to make great trade deals. It’ll be good for the counties, it will be good for us. BW: How long will it take? A year? Two years? DT:  It will go. . . . Yeah, I would say within the first year a lot of it will be done. BW: Sir, in listening to this . . . DT:  But you have to be able to walk. You have to be able to . . .  . BW:  . . . and covering lots of presidents, if I may go back to that experience. DT:  Go ahead. BW: Trying to understand them. Reagan was Morning in America. And it’s almost like you’re saying, at least for a while, morning in the ditch. That we are just not going to be able to get out because of these trade deals, because of your pessimism about the economy. DT: Look, we are losing $500 billion a year on trade deficits with China. Okay? We’ve been for a long time, from 200 to 500. We are losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade. You look at Japan. They send their cars in here by the hundreds of thousands. You go to Los Angeles, you look at those docks, and these cars get driven off those boats at 40 miles an hour. You’ve never seen anything like it. They just come pouring into our country. And yet when  —   you talk about an imbalance, when it comes to us selling to Japan? They take very little. BW: Where’s the optimism to get out of this? DT: Oh, I have great optimism. BW: You do? DT:  Oh. Oh, okay. With all of that, I’m an optimistic person. You know, “Make America great again. ” . . . BW: Oh yeah. What’s the . . .  . DT:  Make America great again. That’s actually a very optimistic  —   you know, that’s not  —   some people say, oh, that’s so  —  because they hate the word “again. ” I said, ”No, no, you don’t understand. We’re going to make America great again.” People view that as very positive. Do you know, workers. . . . . You can have that [unclear] question. I dictated this out pretty much. CL:  [unclear] we have [unclear] in 15 minutes. DT:  But you know what, we can delay that meeting for 20 minutes. I love this. CL: I know, but it’s a very important  —   and it’s respectful. I just  —   we set it up, and . . .  . DT:  Could you call them up and say could we delay half an hour? CL: I can, but we promised these guys an hour, [unclear] an hour and 15. DT:  [unclear] Call them back, tell them we’ll be 45 minutes late, is it okay? Only if it’s okay. If he can’t do it. .. CL:  I don’t know. Let me find out. DT: Okay. Because I’d like to finish with these guys. BW: Thank you. We appreciate it. DT:  So just so you understand, mine is a message of great optimism. We can fix it. RC: But not everyone thinks that, right? DT: No, no. Not everybody thinks that. Some people don’t understand that. RC: Bob was in New Haven, Connecticut, the other day, and he met a maid in a hotel who identified herself as Mexican. And one of the things she said was, “He does not like me. ” BW: Meaning you. I asked her about you. What do you think of Trump? DT: Was she here. .. RC:  And she said, “All I want is my dignity. ” DT:  Yeah. I’ll give her great dignity. Let me hear the question  —   you may not know the answer. RC:  What do you have to say to her? DT: Was she here legally or illegally? BW: I asked her, and she would not say. DT: That means she was here illegally. Okay. So here . . .  . BW: Possibly. And she says . . .  Trump, I asked her, I said, what do you think of Mr. Trump? And she said, “He doesn’t like me. ” She took it personally. And then she said, “I just want my dignity. ” DT: I understand that. BW: What would you say to her? DT:  I’ll tell you what I’d say to her. Number one, she was probably here illegally. The polls are all showing people  —   Hispanics  —   that are here legally like me very much. In Nevada, you saw the poll, I’m leading with the Hispanics. People that vote, people that therefore are here. I’m leading with Hispanics. People that are here illegally maybe feel differently and they do feel differently, but people that are here legally, Hispanics that are here, they don’t want their jobs taken. And they know I’ll bring jobs back from China. I’ll bring jobs back from Japan and from Mexico and from all these countries. You look at what Mexico’s doing, Bob. Mexico is the new China, smaller level. Mexico, what they’re doing to us on trade and at the border is unbelievable. Okay? And I was right. When I got up and made that initial speech in Trump Tower on June 16, and I talked about illegal immigration and the problems, that hit a nerve. You know? Because . . .  . RC: It’s not all economic. Because some of these people we encounter on the campaign trail, whether it’s an undocumented Mexican maid or it’s a Muslim, one consequence of your campaign has been they feel isolated in America. And you may disagree with the reason they feel that, but that is how they feel as a consequence of your message. How do you speak to those people who think you don’t want them in this country? Including Muslims. DT:  I am a person that’s going to bring this country together. I’m a person that’s going to unify the country. President Obama is a divider. He is not a unifier. When he first got elected, I didn’t have great feelings for the fact that he was going to do well. But the one thing I thought, he would be able to unify the country. African American, white, I thought that he would be a unifying factor. He has not been. He’s been a great . . .  . BW: But Bob Costa’s right, Mr. Trump, that you talk to people and they feel you’re not a unifier. DT: I know. They feel that now. BW: And you say you are. The question becomes . . . I mean, this is one maid, but I think there are a countless number of people out there who, in essence maybe they could not put it in this articulate way, they want their dignity, and the question is, how are they going to get it from you if you’re president? DT: Well again, so I asked you the very important question, was she here legally or illegally? BW: I don’t know. DT: Because if she was here legally, I think you would find that she would like me very much. In Nevada, where you have a huge Hispanic population, when they did the exit polls, I won with the people that are Hispanic in the state of Nevada. But not by a little bit, by a lot. I think that’s a  —   it’s an important question to ask. I will give people back their dignity because I’m going to bring jobs back. Our jobs are being taken away from us like candy from a baby. Our jobs are being ripped out of our country. Carrier announced  —   I talked about it the last month, because I thought that was in particular bad. Maybe because I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. But . . .  . RC:  People understand the economic argument. But people  —   I think what she was looking for, and others  —   is do you have empathy for the immigrant experience? You think back to your grandfather coming over in 1885. DT: That’s right. Totally. I do. I mean, totally. I mean, ultimately we’re all immigrants, okay? I have total empathy. At the same time, we need borders, otherwise we don’t have a country, and we have to be  —   you have to come into the country legally. And that’s been a big theme of my campaign, and for the most part, I think it’s [unclear]. BW: But this maid doesn’t have a lawyer, I suspect. And she came to the country, we don’t know. And she didn’t do anything that put her in the position she may be in, you’re right. And what she’s saying is  —   and I was floored by what she said, quite frankly. “I just want my dignity. ” DT: Yeah. Well. BW: And a giant question, pulsing out there, is how do people get their dignity that you seem to be quite critical of? Illegal immigrants . . .  . DT:  No. I’m . . .  . BW: Well, you are critical. DT: Well, illegal immigrants, yeah. Just so you understand, I want people to come into this country. I want to make it much easier to come into the country. But they have to come in through a legal process. Were you able to do that, Corey? Huh? CL:  Yeah. DT:  We have a meeting with  —   sort of an important meeting. BW: Yeah, the foreign policy people. DT:  Well actually we already met with them. We just . . .  . BW: Oh you did? How’d that go? DT:    It went great. [Lewandowski speaks inaudibly.] DT:  I’d love to keep it going. I actually enjoy this. I’ll probably end up ruing the day. I’ll say, how could they have said that stuff about me? But I do really enjoy this . . .  . BW: I understand that. And you know, these are such serious questions, and you are answering them with  —   you’re being straight about it. I appreciate that. DT:  Here’s what  —   I think I’ll do really great. With the African Americans. And a lot of people think that. And you know that a lot of people think that. But I think I’m going to do great with the African Americans. I think I’m going to do great with Hispanics. I’m going to bring jobs back to the country. I’m not going to let people take our jobs. I’m not going to let people go  —   I’m not going to let factories and Nabisco and all of these companies  —   Ford  —   we’re going to build here. We’re going to keep the jobs in our country. And we’re going to bring jobs back to our country, Bob. And that’s going to  . . .  . BW: Understand. Let me ask, this is a really . . .  . DT:  Jobs is a very big answer, because that’s going to give . . .  . BW: Of course. Although this maid has a job. DT: That’s right. But dignity. And maybe she’ll have a better job. She’ll have more options. BW: Okay. What would be the most challenging situation that, say you’re president, or the next president, might face? And this is a serious issue. I asked President Obama this a number of years ago. And he said, what I worry about most  —   sitting in the Oval Office, and I think he really meant this  —   I worry the most about a nuclear weapon going off in an American city. DT:  Okay. BW: That is the  . DT: It’s funny, it’s very interesting. I’m surprised he said that, because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. Okay? BW: But he told me . . .  . DT:  Okay. BW: Sat there. And I thought, you can read between  —   do you agree with that? DT:  It’s very interesting. I have . . .  I absolutely agree. I think the single greatest problem that the world has  —   we have an ISIS problem, and we have  —   but the single greatest problem that this world has is a nuclear, the power of nuclear. The tremendous power. You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand. BW: And he’s, President Obama’s having this summit now, right here in Washington, down the street. And he is a strong advocate for eliminating nuclear weapons entirely. DT: Okay. BW: Would you agree with that? DT:  Well, if it’s done on equal basis, absolutely. BW: You would. DT:  But the problem you have now. . . . Done on an equal basis. The problem you have now is you have Pakistan. And you just see what happened in Pakistan. It’s not like, you know, that’s a perfect situation. You have India. You have so many countries now with nuclear already. You have some very bad people trying very hard to get nuclear. So I think that’s something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it’s not going to happen very easily. BW: Would you pick up the baton on that effort on his part? DT: I would love to see a   world. Will that happen? Chances are extremely small that will happen. Look, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on   their entire nuclear arsenal. RC:  When you look at foreign policy . . .  . DT: By the way, I love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen. RC:  Did you read Jeffrey Goldberg’s article about Obama’s foreign policy? In the Atlantic, Obama gave . . .  . DT:    In the Atlantic, okay. RC:  So one of the quotes Obama said in there is, “The notion that Russia is somehow in a stronger position now in Syria and Ukraine than they were before they invaded Ukraine or before he had to deploy military forces in Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs. Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence. ” That’s Obama on global power. Do you agree? DT:  Well, I think there’s a certain truth to that. I think there’s a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don’t even want to use the word, fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what’s going on with respect to our military and it’s depleted from all of the cuts. Hey, as a real estate person, all the time I’m getting listings of bases, Army bases, Marine bases, naval bases. I keep saying, how many bases do they have? I’m constantly getting, it’s crossing my desk, do we want to buy a base in Virginia? Do we want to buy. . . . And I see it all the time. We have to strengthen our military. It’s so vital to do that. We have to strengthen our military. By the way, we have to take care of our vets. So vital. But we have to strengthen our military. Now, one of the things that The Washington Post treated me very badly on, when I talked to you about NATO, we’re spending too much money, and we’re not getting treated with respect from the 28 countries that we’re dealing with. RC:  This comes back to the Lone Ranger point. I think even globally, you’re comfortable being the United States president. DT: No. RC:  Not being an interventionist . . .  . DT:  I didn’t say I’d get out of NATO. I say it’s got to be.  . . . First of all, it’s obsolete. Our big threat today is terrorism. Okay? And NATO’s not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don’t have the Soviet Union. RC: Well, you don’t have a great belief in these international institutions. DT:  No, because we seem to get ripped off by everybody. We seem to always be the one that pays the bill and gets the least. And we’re going to stop doing that. BW: But you’re talking about reform of NATO, aren’t you, rather than  . . .   . DT:  Yes, I’m talking about reform. BW: You’re not just saying, let’s move out. DT:  I’m talking totally about reform. But you have to be  —    in order to get reform, you have to be prepared to walk. Otherwise you can’t get reform. For instance, the Iran deal. Had John Kerry stood up from his chair when they kept saying no, no, no, no  —   he didn’t get anything. Had he stood up twice  —   once or twice  —   from his chair and said, sorry gentlemen, we’re leaving, and increased the sanctions, you would’ve had a whole different Iran deal. BW: Okay. One really important question. DT: Go ahead. BW: A couple of years ago, I had a breakfast with one of the leaders, heads of state, of our best allies. And I asked him about Obama. And he was talking off the record, and he said, “I like him. He is smart. But no one in the world is afraid of him. ” Do you agree with that? And in a Trump administration  —   are you formulating a new doctrine of you better be afraid of me? DT:  Yeah, I don’t want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country. Right now, they don’t respect our country. BW: But do they respect you if you kind of . . .  . DT:  People have respected me. My life has been a life where I’ve been respected. I want them to respect our country. I want them to respect our leader. But I want them to respect our country. Now, you could use . . .  . BW: How do you achieve that, sir? DT:  Through the aura of personality. Through having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. I’ve watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring and he’d talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that  —   you know. And then he’d win. And respect is about winning. We don’t win anymore. I see it in my  —   we don’t win anymore. And he’d win. I’ve seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I’ve seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they’d get into the ring  —   and then they’d get knocked out. And guess what? It’s all gone. Let me just say: we don’t win anymore. BW: So do you want Putin to be afraid of you? DT:  I want Putin to respect our country, okay? BW: And what would he respect? DT:  Well, first of all, it’s sort of interesting. He said very good things about me. BW: Understand. DT:  You saw that. He said, Trump is brilliant and Trump is going to be the new leader and all that. And some of these clowns said, you should repudiate Putin. I said, why would I repudiate him? He’s not going to get anything. Because I’ve been through this stuff before. But he said very positive things about me. And I say to myself  —   and I say to people  —   wouldn’t it be nice if we actually could get along with Russia? And if we could get along with these people? China takes advantage of us. Look at what they’re doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be playing that game. Okay? Look at what they’re doing. That is a lack of respect. When they’re building a massive, like nobody’s ever seen before  —   they’re building islands in the middle of the South China Sea for a massive military complex. Beyond runways. I mean, this is a complex. So what I’m saying is there’s a tremendous lack of respect for our country. And I think for our leader. BW: But what does Putin respect? The former KGB lieutenant colonel? Force. Power. DT: I think he respects strength. Okay? I think Putin respects strength. And I’ve said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don’t say that  —   only a fool would say, “I will,” but I feel that I will get along well with Putin. I feel that if we can get along with more countries, that’s a positive thing. That’s not a bad thing. Some people  —   for instance, when Putin came out and he wanted to bomb the hell out of ISIS, we had people standing on the stage, we don’t want that, we want. . . . Let me tell you something. If we have somebody else dropping bombs that cost a half a million dollars a piece on the top  —   if we have somebody helping us, that’s not so bad. You understand that. That’s not so bad. But I had people that I’m running against saying, like, that was a terrible thing. It’s not a terrible thing. We have a situation in Libya where a friend of mine is just saying, so, we had Gaddafi, he killed the terrorists, he ran his place. Not a good man. Same thing you could say with Iraq, with Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a   at killing terrorists, that’s one thing. If our presidents would have gone away and gone to the beach, the Middle East would be a far better place than it is right now. I don’t say it would be run by nice people, but you know, it would be a far better place. The mistakes we’ve made in the Middle East are so astronomical. Now here’s the thing: ISIS is now. . . . A friend of mine who’s very much involved in the energy business, ISIS is controlling the oil now in Libya. How did we let that happen? RC: So just turning back. DT:  And by the way, that oil? That is a great oil, and it’s a lot of oil. And they’re controlling it. RC: We were looking over your 1990 book, Surviving at the Top. DT: Right. RC:  And thinking about, what would happen if Trump’s president of the United States? And you  —    this is a line from your book, then: “The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having. ” If you get the presidency, you are going to have it. DT:  Yeah, but see, that’s not the getting. The getting, for me, is to make our country great again. The getting  —   that’s just a part of it. The getting the position is not the real getting. For me, the getting is  —   and that’s when I’ll say, congratulations everyone, my job is finished. We will make our country financially strong again. When you have 19 . . . I had a woman come up to me. A wonderful woman. I said this one or two times in the speech. She said, ”Mr. Trump, I love you. You’re so incredible. I’m voting for you 100 percent, but could you stop saying you’re going to make our country rich again?” I said, ”I understand what you’re saying  —   it doesn’t sound nice. But without being rich again, we can’t be great again.” I am going to make our country rich again. We are, the thing I didn’t like about The Washington Post, they didn’t put down my real statements as to Japan and everything else. They make it sound like I want Japan to have nuclear weapons. I don’t. And by the way, other people have said this too. I don’t mind taking care of Japan. But they have to help us out more, monetarily. We can’t protect the entire world. You look at our military budget, it’s massive compared to any other country. But what are we doing? We’re taking care of the military needs of all these countries. And these countries are much richer than us. We’re not a rich country. We’re a debtor nation. We’ve got to get rid of  —   I talked about bubble. We’ve got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt. BW: How long would that take? DT:  I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers . . .  . BW: What’s fairly quickly? DT:  Well, I would say over a period of eight years. And I’ll tell you why. BW: Would you ever be open to tax increases as part of that, to solve the problem? DT: I don’t think I’ll need to. The power is trade. Our deals are so bad. BW: That would be $2 trillion a year. DT: No, but I’m renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We’re losing with everybody. And a lot of those deals  —   a lot of people say, how could the politicians be so stupid? It’s not that they’re stupid. It’s that they’re controlled by lobbyists and special interests who want those deals to be made. BW: So we want to go back and tell our readers about this interview, and we’ll run the transcript of it, I’m sure. When does the coalition building begin? DT:  You’re talking now again? BW: For Trump. CLi:  [Unclear] do you want me to cancel the other meeting? Because he has a hard out, and we’re already late. DT:  Let me give you this final answer, and then if you want we can meet again. BW: Yes. Okay, that’s great. Is that . . . . DT:  . . . Phase two. We’ll call it  —   at least treat me fairly in phase one, but phase two. BW: Of course. DT: The coalition building begins  —   I believe  —   when it’s decided who wins. Hopefully I’m going to win. The coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in  —   these are tough cookies  —   he came in, years ago  —   and I’ll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt. Now, this guy could’ve whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy  —   the player  —   was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed  —   I was a young guy  —   he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally. . . . And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won. This was after he had won so much, okay? And when you have these coaches that are just as tough as him but they don’t win, there’s revolutions. Okay? Nobody. . . . But Vince Lombardi was able to win, and he got  —   I have never seen anything like it. It was such a vivid impression. You had this big powerful guy, and you had Vince Lombardi, and he grabbed him by the shirt and he was screaming at him, he was angry at him. BW: But to do that  —   a colleague of ours . . .  . DT:  No, to do that you have to win. BW: Yes. But David Maraniss, a colleague of ours, wrote the book on Vince Lombardi. DT:  Yeah. BW: ”When Pride Still Mattered.” Right? What Vince Lombardi did, he got to the point of winning by building a coalition of 11 players on the field. He couldn’t have a guard and a tackle who were not part of the team. DT:  Okay, let me answer this way, because I think it will be a very positive ending. Because I agree with you. Ultimately, I will build a coalition. I think it’s too soon. I really do. I think it’s too soon. Now, I may be wrong. But this isn’t something I needed to do. This is something I want to do. I want to give back, and I’ll do a fantastic job. And I know politicians. I know them all. They’re only talented at one thing: getting elected. Now, you have some that have certain assets, but they’re talented at one thing: getting elected. Raising funds, and getting elected. Okay? And when I first ran, Charles Krauthammer said, and this was before I had run, and he was sitting there  —   I told you this story. He was sitting on Fox. And he said, this is one of the most talented fields of senators and governors and people running for office in the history of our country, and certainly since World War II. Now this is about two months before I’m announcing. And I’m saying to myself, wow. That’s tough. You know, here’s a guy who must know. It’s tough. They also said I wouldn’t run and I ran. But I said, wow, that’s a big statement. I said, all right, but I’m doing it. Then I decide  —   top of the escalator  —   I said to my wife, come on, let’s go. Deep breath, went down, did it. Okay. Now I’ve defeated those people, most of them. I’ve defeated them. And I say, really? Meaning to his statement. Really? Not a lot of talent. BW: So we have on the media, which you are quite critical . . .  . DT:  Media treats me very unfairly, and very inaccurately. BW: Okay, and the question is, why? And if I may, Richard Nixon, something he said . . . about the media, what it does, the media looks in the mirror instead of looking out the window  —   and gather facts and listen to other people  —   they’re more interested in themselves. Is that part of the problem? DT:  Well, I think they’re more interested in hits. I did a thing the other day with  —   on CNN  —   with Anderson Cooper. I don’t know if you saw the rating. Give him the ratings, if you have it. Do you have the ratings? RC:  We saw it. HH:  You have them, sir. DT:  They were through  —   I just got this. They were through the roof. Here. Mine was through the roof, meaning my hour was through the roof. Now, that’s good and bad. The bad is they want to cover me too much, and they write things that maybe they shouldn’t be writing. But those were phenomenal. Won the evening, beat everybody, et cetera, et cetera. My segment, not the other segments. The other segments did all right, but my segment was one of the   shows in a long time and beat everybody on cable  —   beat everybody on television that night. So you’ll take a look. That’s good and it’s bad. The bad is they want to do nothing but cover me. They write stories that are  —   that don’t even make sense. I’m just saying, I wish I could be covered accurately and fairly by the media. BW: By why, then? Is this ideology, is this partisanship, is it laziness? What is it? DT: Well, it could be some laziness. Today they want the clicks. In the old days they wanted the ratings, or they wanted to sell newspapers. Today they see if somebody clicks. So they do a story on me and they get clicks all over the place. They do a story on somebody else, it doesn’t matter. All I can say is this. I wish I could be treated fairly by the media. And if I was treated fairly by the media, I think you would see a very big difference in coalition and coalition building and a lot of things. But with that being said, I’m not ready to do coalition building. But when I do  —   I tell that Vince Lombardi story  —   if and when I win, it will be really easy to build up a coalition. One other thing. I told you this. We are getting calls from so many people that you speak to, you speak to, that are saying, oh we don’t like Trump, we’ve got to stop Trump. They’re calling me. They’re talking to you and they’re calling me. Because they think I’m going to win. RC:  Well the next step is getting them off the phone and out into the public. DT:  Yeah, but we’re already  —   look, we already have. . . .  Chris came in, and Carson came in. We already have a lot of people. We are getting calls from people that you’re writing about, or other people are writing about, and I’m telling you, names that you wouldn’t believe. Bob, you  —   the greatest skeptic probably of all time  —   even more than you. That’s only because he’s older than you. He’s seen more. People that you wouldn’t even think about would be calling are calling. They want to make a deal. They want to come on board. RC:  But you know what they tell us? We call the same people. Or I’ve been calling the same people. You know what they say about Trump? So much promise, political talent, yet he seems to have a blind spot. When he’s ahead, he seems to pull back. That’s maybe not the view you have, I understand. But that is how a lot of Washington people see it. They think you get so close to the nomination, and then things happen . . . . DT: I can only say this: my whole life has been about winning. My whole life. I’ve won a lot. And one little example? This building. This was one of the most   buildings in the history of the General Services Administration. Owned by them for many years. The landlord to the United States, right? Every major company  —   almost everybody  —   I don’t have to  —  obviously, look, the best location in Washington. Right between the Capitol and the White House. BW: Great building. DT:  The best location, best building. The walls are four foot thick of solid granite. Amazing how they were able to lift it up. I mean, frankly, amazing. This is before they had cranes as we know them today. Unbelievable place. And it will be one of the great hotels in the world. Everybody wanted it. Every hotel company. Everybody. Pritzker wanted it. Who’s closer to Obama than Pritzker? Hyatt wanted it. They had the Jewish Museum all lined up. They had everything all lined up. . . .  They own Hyatt. Hyatt didn’t get it. The reason I got it was because I have an unbelievable balance sheet   because they wanted to make sure it got done  —   and because of the fact that I had a great concept. BW: But let’s . . .  . DT:  But think of it: I got it in the Obama administration. BW: Understand. DT:  And people say to me, Bob, how the hell did you get the most sought  —   after real estate asset perhaps in the history of the GSA  —   and you understand what I mean by that. BW: Of course. DT:  You know, they have land in the middle of nowhere, nobody cares about it. They say, how did you get the most   asset perhaps in the history of the GSA? RC: And your political allies say the same exact thing. They appreciate that part of your profile and your skill. They talk about it all the time. All we’re saying is, they also  —   they’re concerned that you’re hurting yourself along the way as you get close to the nomination. DT: Well don’t forget, they’ve been concerned about that 10 times during the course of this last . . .  . BW: Yeah, but here’s what’s going on, we think. And it has to do with psychology. And one of the things you learn, being a reporter, being a builder with your background, is that everyone is concerned about themselves. . . . These people feel disrespected. They feel that they’ve not been given their dignity. DT:  They will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved. BW: And they want in. DT: Yeah, I know. BW: And what, to use your term, you’ve built a wall to a certain extent. You’ve said, I am the Lone Ranger. I am doing this on my own. DT:  No, at the right time I want them in. BW: Okay, but . . .  . DT:  I just think it’s early. BW: Okay, but suppose you needed to do that sooner. DT:  I’d be capable of doing it. I just think it’s . . .  . BW: Will you call us the day it starts? DT:  I will. BW: Because that’s . . .  . DT:  And some of the people that are calling me  —   and maybe I should be calling them  —   but some of the people that are calling me and calling him, in all fairness, and calling others, too. One called you. But some of these people that are   and people you’ve  —   that would be very interesting to you. These people want in. And I’m taking them in. They’re going to come in. BW: Maybe you have to reach out, then. DT: Yeah. Because to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn’t have to be calling me. BW: Yes, exactly. DT: You’re right. BW: Because it’s coalition building. RC: Right, that’s the key thing. You’re always talking about people calling you. DT: And I’m going to be doing that very soon. CL: I do think it’s fair to say that we have not publicized a lot of our D. C. outreach for specific reasons, and I don’t think the media is aware of that. HH:  Yeah. CL: Including the foreign policy meetings that you have done, including the private meetings we’ve done. DT:  Well, we had a good meeting this morning for foreign policy, you know, and we’ve had some pretty good meetings. RC:   We’re not questioning that there are organizational efforts. We’re just saying . . .  . DT:  No, at the right time. You know, it’s an interesting statement that Bob . . .  . RC:  You love talking, though, about how people call you, but we often don’t hear about Trump calling . . .  . DT:  No? RC:  We know you called McConnell once or twice. DT: I should be calling them. RC:  More. DT: And I will be calling them. As soon as I feel that time is right. RC:  And it goes back to the point about VP: you do acknowledge there is a limitation you have in this town, in this political place of Washington. DT:  Sure, sure. I’ve been a very political person all my life. RC:  Understood. DT: I’ve been on the other side, but still I’ve been very political . . .  . RC:  Different. Donor and a politician. DT:  Well, I’ve gotten unbelievable political things done: zoning. This building. Bob, how did I get this building? RC: When you call a senator up now, and you pitch yourself, as you near the nomination, what do you say to them? When you’re calling them cold? DT:  Well first of all, I do call some people that have just lost. Meaning, you know, they supported Rubio, they supported this. And we’ve dealt with. . . . Honestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them. And in a pretty near distance, right now, already, I’m going to start calling them. But I love the point you’re making. This is a point that you’re making, but it’s a point I agree with. I should be calling . . .  . BW: Yes. Because we have  —   it’s not making  —   Bob Costa and I are making it because we hear it from people. DT:  Yeah. They don’t know how to get in. BW: There is the sound of silence. And yeah, exactly. DT:  And then they get vicious. At the right point, I’m going to be calling them. One thing I’m going to do . . .  . BW: Who’s going to be the first call? DT:  I will be call . . .  that’s a very good case, I better not tell you that. I’ll let you know when I make it. Okay? BW: Okay. And we have to have phase . . .  . DT:  One quick thing I’m going to do, a lot of people are saying, oh, the judges. . . .  To me, the judges  —   because there’s going to be a lot of them in these next four years. We’ve got one already that was unexpected in Scalia. So the judges are going to be important. You’re going to have either   judges, or you’re going to have conservative judges. So important. They don’t know me well enough. Well, what kind of judges? I’m going to do something. It was my idea, and I think it was a good idea. And I spoke to Senator Sessions and I spoke to other people, and I’m getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation. I’m getting names, and I’m going to submit a list of about 10 names, 10 or 12 names, as judges. I’m going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I’m going to put up. And I’m going to guarantee it. I’m going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he’ll put the wrong judge in. Like people  —   my sister is on the court of appeals. Very smart. She’s a very smart, very highly respected person. Very smart. BW: People keep trying to get her to talk, and she won’t. DT: You know what? BW: Does she have a nondisclosure agreement? DT:  She’s fantastic. She’s the exact opposite of me. People say, is she really your sister? She’s a brilliant person. Highly respected. When the press calls, I say, listen, they want to do a great story. They actually had a nice story about her in The Washington Post recently. But she doesn’t want to talk to the press, because she feels as a judge she should not be speaking to the press. Something very nice about that. She’s right. BW: I disagree, but . . .  . DT:  As a judge. No, but as a judge. RC:  As a reporter, he disagrees. DT: Oh, as a reporter. But there’s something nice about that. She feels . . .  . BW: But it’s not just the individual calls, it’s the message of inclusiveness, that it doesn’t come through. DT:  Bob, I’ve been hit very hard. RC:  Here’s the problem I think you may face. You start an inclusive message, you turn that corner. Let’s say you’re the nominee and you say, ’You know what? I’m going to tell Woodward who I called. I’m going to start being a unifier.’ But maybe so many bridges have been burned within the party that not everyone’s going to be willing . . .  . DT:  It’s possible, but I don’t think so. I’ve been here before. RC:  And you may say to yourself, I wish I had built relationships sooner. DT:  Don’t forget, I’ve been hit hard. I went in one of 17 and they hit me harder than anybody. And I hit back very hard. Harder than they hit me. Jeb: low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating. I think the low energy Jeb, all of a sudden you see him running down the street to try and show he’s got high energy. And it wasn’t him, and it became worse. I hit back very hard. I am telling you, almost all of these people that you would never think would ever  —   will want to come on board. But I’ve got to win first. That’s why I told you that Vince Lombardi story. Because I think it’s a great story. Anyway, I have to go. Let’s do it again. BW: Okay. When  —   should we do it tomorrow? [Laughter] DT:  Just treat me fairly. Treat me fairly. . . .  Actually the truth is these were very interesting. Nobody has asked me these questions.              Caption   The Republican candidate continues to dominate the presidential contest.

(Read More) ROUND 1 ANALYSIS Round 1 is in the books, and it was quite an interesting chapter. Laremy Tunsil, arguably the draft’s top prospect in terms of pro potential, slid to the 13th overall pick after a Twitter post appeared on his account depicting the offensive tackle smoking from a bong while wearing a gas mask. Ole Miss had a rough night overall as Robert Nkemdiche, another   prospect, slipped all the way to No. 29 and the Arizona Cardinals. Trades reshaped the first round at lightning speed, as the Broncos traded up to select Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch late in the round. Meanwhile the San Francisco 49ers also traded back into the first round to take a guard most did not see as a   prospect. Below is the    from Round 1, as recorded in real time by Washington Post NFL writer Mark Maske and draft analyst John Harris. Also included: A look back at the draft history of some of the   and   teams since 1996.    Just minutes before the first round of the NFL draft Thursday, a video was posted on Twitter of the projected No. 1 pick, Laremy Tunsil, smoking marijuana. Here is what you should know about the alleged hack that caused other teams to pass on the former Ole Miss offensive lineman. (Ashleigh   Washington Post)     [  video surfaces of Laremy Tunsil just before draft]       1. Los Angeles Rams (from Tennessee) Team needs: QB, MLB, DB, WR, C The pick: Jared Goff | QB | Cal The Rams surprise no one and take Jared Goff, the Cal quarterback they were expected to take pretty much since they traded up to get the No. 1 pick from the Tennessee Titans. They did right by the league and did their best to maintain a little bit of suspense by keeping the pick under wraps, at least officially, until tonight. What else could they have done after being given the L. A. market by the NFL? Did they do the right thing by taking Goff over Carson Wentz? Who knows. Only time will tell on that, as history has demonstrated what an inexact science this is. But if the Rams are correct about Goff being a franchise    many of the other pieces needed for them to be a contender already are in place as they get settled in Los Angeles.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He’s the best pure passer in this draft, making throws to spots that others in this draft class have no chance to consistently strike. It would appear that the Northern California kid will move south to L. A. and be the face of the Los Angeles Rams, version 2. 0.   [For Goff and Wentz, NFL draft is as easy as  ]   As for the talent: The ball comes out of his hand hot and he does show that he has full   ability. He doesn’t have a cannon arm and succeeds more with touch and   than he does   bullet throws. That said, his   is on par with some of the best I’ve studied over the past two decades.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The Rams made the right   move to trade up for the No. 1 pick, even with the significant cost of the draft choices they had to send to the Titans. Multiple pieces are already in place for the Rams to be a contender, and they simply had to take their shot at getting a franchise QB. They couldn’t have settled into the L. A. market with Case Keenum as their quarterback. Was Goff over Carson Wentz the right decision? The Rams have to cross their fingers and hope like heck that it was. But they did what they had to do. Grade: A  —     —   Maske Draft history         2. Philadelphia Eagles (from Cleveland) Team needs: CB, OL, QB, RB The pick: Carson Wentz | QB | North Dakota State It’s Carson Wentz going second to the Eagles after Jared Goff went first to the Rams. So far, things have gone as scripted. Sam Bradford doesn’t like it, and the Eagles don’t seem to care. Barring an abrupt reversal, they’ll have Wentz sit and learn for a season or two while Bradford plays. Now the   intrigue begins with the No. 3 pick by the Chargers. Will they go with Jalen Ramsey or an offensive tackle, either Laremy Tunsil or Ronnie Stanley?  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Wentz led the Bison to two consecutive FCS Championships, although he missed a huge portion of the 2015 season. His athleticism really pops off the page when watching him. He’s sort of a poor man’s Cam Newton. As a next level QB though, he has exactly what teams desire. He’s tall in the pocket, has a classic release, is poised vs. pressure for the most part, can make throws on the run, has a strong and accurate arm in terms of ball placement   …     I’m running out of commas. He came up big in the clutch last season, especially late in the FCS Championship game in 2014.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The overall strategy by the Eagles was curious, and not because it alienated Sam Bradford. That has nothing to do with it; he must play well to land his next lucrative contract. But why give Bradford a significant deal and then trade up for Wentz in the same offseason? The Eagles have created a QB issue for themselves. Long term, if Wentz is the real deal, it won’t matter. But shorter term, there’s room to wonder if the Eagles have improved themselves. Grade: C+  —   Maske Draft history         3. San Diego Chargers Team needs: OT, S, DL The pick: Joey Bosa | DE | Ohio State The Chargers surprise many and pass up Jalen Ramsey and both offensive tackles, Laremy Tunsil and Ronnie Stanley, to take Joey Bosa.   are   in the NFL, and Bosa is regarded as the top   in this draft. But if Ramsey becomes a legendary NFL defensive back, this pick will be questioned for a long time. And Philip Rivers might end up wondering why the team didn’t upgrade his offensive line.  —   Mark Maske   [Did Myles Jack’s candor cost him a   spot?]   What he brings: Bosa admitted that he wasn’t completely pleased with his combine performance. He didn’t run exceptionally well with a 4. 86 in the 40. However, one area that caught my attention was that he clocked a 6. 89 in the   drill. That change of direction is key and he more than flashed that trait with that  .0 second time. His   burst off the ball is   ready, but he’s not as dynamic overall as the top edge rushers in previous drafts. That said, he’s still athletic for a nearly   man. He can get lazy against the run and against good tight ends   tackles. Still, you won’t find many warts on Bosa. But there are things he needs to work on going forward.  —   John Harris  Early evaluation:   are   in the NFL. The Chargers get the player considered the top pass rusher in this draft class. But they left Jalen Ramsey, Laremy Tunsil and Ronnie Stanley on the board. What if Ramsey is a special player at cornerback or safety? Will Philip Rivers regret that the team didn’t upgrade his offensive line? Grade:    —   Maske Draft history         4. Dallas Cowboys Team needs: DE, Secondary, RB The pick: Ezekiel Elliott | RB | Ohio State The Cowboys pass up Jalen Ramsey and go with Elliott. Interesting. Productive runners can be gotten long after the No. 4 pick in a draft. But the Rams were happy that they took Todd Gurley 10th last year. The Cowboys obviously believe Elliott is a special running back who can recreate what they had with DeMarco Murray two seasons ago. But if Ramsey has a Hall of Fame career, the Cowboys will remember the gift that they just opted against accepting.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: At the combine, he tested beyond expectation, to be honest. He ran 4. 47 in the 40 at 225 lb. pounds with a 1. 58   split. That performance may have landed him in Dallas as the No. 4 pick. He is a tremendous athlete born of great athletic parents. He has vision to find the hole, a   to get clean, can burst past the safety in the alley and cutting ability to start to the sideline then upfield. He’s got the power to fight through a defensive back tackle effort too.  —   John Smith Early evaluation: The Cowboys clearly are convinced that Elliott is a special running back and his presence will allow them to recreate what they had two seasons ago with DeMarco Murray. But productive NFL runners can be drafted long after the fourth overall selection. If Jalen Ramsey ends up being great, the Cowboys could regret not taking advantage of the gift they were given when he fell to them. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         5. Jacksonville Jaguars Team needs: CB, OLB, OL, LB The pick: Jalen Ramsey |    | Florida State The Jaguars get a gift with Jalen Ramsey dropping to them after the Chargers and Cowboys passed him up. He could be a special player at either cornerback or safety. Some wonder about his relatively low number of interceptions. But few talent evaluators doubt that he will be a major NFL contributor.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He tested off the charts at the combine and deserved to go in the   of this draft. He played corner in 2015 but I think he’s best served as a playmaking safety going forward. That said, he’s an excellent corner but he can be in a different stratosphere at safety in the right scheme. He has length, football IQ and playmaking ability. His safety instincts are just so far off the charts, to be honest, that he’s at his best when his team moves him all over the formation. And teams can do that better when he’s at safety.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The Jaguars made the obvious move when Ramsey dropped to them for the No. 5 selection. That doesn’t make it any less right. Grade:    —   Maske Draft history         6. Baltimore Ravens Team needs: OL, DE, ILB, SS The pick: Ronnie Stanley | OT | Notre Dame It was clear the Ravens would go with an offensive tackle here. It’s interesting that it’s Ronnie Stanley and not Laremy Tunsil. If the Titans had kept the No. 1 pick instead of trading it to the Rams, Tunsil probably would have been their choice. Now he is falling toward the lower half of the top 10. But there were a number of teams that had Stanley over Tunsil, and obviously the Ravens were among them.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: An outstandingly fluid athlete for a  . He’s adept at getting separation on contact in  . His arm length is impressive and once he locks out, it’s over. Power defensive ends have no chance against him if they can’t make him move quickly upfield. The downside is he doesn’t get consistent movement in the run game. And Clemson’s Shaq Lawson troubled him with a combination of speed upfield and   inside counters —   John Harris Early evaluation: It’s not surprising that the Ravens emerged from this draft with a potential franchise left tackle. It is a bit surprising that they chose Ramsey over Laremy Tunsil with both available for the No. 6 selection. Tunsil’s difficult night, including the appearance of the instantly infamous Twitter video just before the draft, was well documented. But some teams already had Stanley ranked ahead of Tunsil. Grade: B  —   Maske     7. San Francisco 49ers Team needs: QB, OT, WR, CB The pick: DeForest Buckner | DE | Oregon Chip Kelly again gets an Oregon player as the 49ers go with DeForest Buckner. The Niners become the first truly   team to pass on Memphis QB Paxton Lynch. But Buckner is a very solid pick who should be a productive NFL defensive lineman.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He’s known for his violent hands and his arms that just don’t end. There are two different ways to look at Buckner though. In terms of his size, he has physical gifts off the charts. Athletically, I don’t see the twitchy, burst off the snap sort of skills. It’s not a   at all but he’s not the next coming of JJ Watt.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The 49ers get a former Oregon player in Buckner. He was well worth the seventh selection. But they traded back up into the opening round to draft a guard, in Garnett, not widely viewed as a likely   pick. That move made little sense. Grade:    —   Maske Draft history         8. Tennessee Titans (from Cleveland) Team needs: OT, S, CB The pick: Jack Conklin | OT | Michigan State The Titans, after trading down from No. 1 to No. 15, trade back up to eighth and take Jack Conklin. Tennessee might have taken Laremy Tunsil at No. 1, and they just had a chance to take him at No. 8. But they pass him up, and you have to wonder how much tonight’s Twitter controversy is playing into Tunsil’s plummet. Whatever the case, the Titans bolster their offensive line for Marcus Mariota. Are the Browns ever going to actually pick?  —   Mark Maske What he brings: His measurables got everyone’s attention. He had one of the better OL short shuttle times, registering 4. 57 seconds. He left little doubt he’s ready to be one of the first offensive linemen off the board. Has allowed only 2. 5 sacks in his first 27 career games. He doesn’t always have great feet  —   they’ll stop on contact, which keeps him from finishing blocks. I would like to see him more under control getting to the second level, but he’s nasty and has a true offensive lineman demeanor.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Tennessee still ended up with an offensive tackle to help safeguard   quarterback Marcus Mariota after adding picks by trading out of No. 1. Grade: B+  —   Maske     9. Chicago Bears (from Tampa Bay) Team needs: TE, Edge rusher, OT, CB The pick: Leonard Floyd | OLB | Georgia The Bears move up for Leonard Floyd, the player that some (including me) projected them to get at 11th. He should be a solid contributor on defense. But few envisioned him as a   pick. Players such as Myles Jack and, especially, Laremy Tunsil are falling below where they were expected to be chosen.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Overall at the combine, Floyd showed what many of us knew  —   he’s a freaky, long and agile athlete. He showed up at 244 pounds, ran 4. 60 in the 40, had a 39.  vertical and a     broad jump. He gives me a bit of a poor man’s Aldon Smith vibe. I love the potential, his length and his relentless nature.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Chicago ended up with a solid addition to its defense. But did the Bears really have to trade up to make that happen? Grade:    —   Maske     10. New York Giants Team needs: OL, ILB, FS, DE The pick: Eli Apple | CB | Ohio State That’s a mild surprise with the Giants taking Eli Apple at 10th. They just spent huge money to sign a veteran cornerback, Janoris Jenkins, in free agency. The defense clearly needed to be upgraded, and the Giants continue to devote resources to that in the draft following their free agent spending spree.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Any trepidation I had about his high ranking in my Top 50 went out the window after after the combine. With long arms and good feed, this guy looks the part more than any other CB in this draft class. He’s raw though. He tends to get sloppy with his technique. His hips, feet, change of direction are all next level though. He can play press and bail coverage and he runs and mirrors receivers without much effort. His instincts are great too He anticipates route combinations extremely well.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The Giants spent big money in free agency to attempt to fix their defense. One of those expensive additions was cornerback Jenkins. So it’s a bit surprising that they used the 10th choice on a cornerback, and some regarded that selection as a bit of a stretch for Apple. Still, that defense needed plenty of work. Grade:    —   Maske     11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (from Chicago) Team needs: DE, C, CB, S The pick: Vernon Hargreaves III | CB | Florida The Buccaneers trade back two spots and still get the player, Vernon Hargreaves, that many (including me) thought they’d get at No. 9. It’s the right move for them. He has the talent to step right in and play immediately.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Other than an average 4. 50 in the 40, he solidified a spot in the   of the draft at the combine, where he displayed plenty of explosiveness. Receivers throughout the SEC have said facing Hargreaves is the most stern test of their season. He did struggle against former Alabama star WR Amari Cooper in 2014, but Cooper said Hargreaves was the toughest guy he faced.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: When you can move back and still get your top target, that’s a shrewd move. Grade: B+  —   Maske     12. New Orleans Saints Team needs:   rusher, Interior OL, WR, CB The pick: Sheldon Rankins |   | Louisville The Saints once were among the teams linked to Paxton Lynch. But they simply had to continue to try to fix their defense and that’s what they did by selecting Sheldon Rankins.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He was dominant at the Senior Bowl, although he got a bit dinged up later in the week. His build, quickness and ability to penetrate gave the opposing line trouble all week long. He plays with a ton of leverage and can rock a   and walk him back into the QB. He flaunts a powerful base and you’re not going to move him off the ball. Even against double teams, he just clogs up the space without getting moved.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: A New Orleans defense that seems perpetually in need of help gets a player who should make things better. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         13. Miami Dolphins (from Philadelphia) Team needs: OT, RB, OLB, Young edge rusher The pick: Laremy Tunsil | OT | Ole Miss So Laremy Tunsil’s wait is over as he goes 13th to the Dolphins. That’s 12 spots lower than he might have gone if the Titans had retained the No. 1 pick. The Twitter video that surfaced just before the draft tonight certainly didn’t help. But he is a very talented offensive tackle. This ends up appearing to be a seemingly   potentially   move for Miami.  —   Mark Maske   [The steep, painful slide of Laremy Tunsil]   What he brings: Based solely on football ability, he’s the class of the 2016 draft class. But his slide had nothing to do with that and everything to do with that video that seemed to show him using drugs. He’s a bona fide left tackle and I’ve thought that since his first start as a true freshman in 2013. He is exacxtly what an NFL left tackle looks like. He missed half of the 2015 season after being suspended due to an NCAA inquiry. He also had a   injury in 2014 Peach Bowl the year prior. When he’s healthy, he plays with great knee bend, a powerful base and he’s quick and explosive in all of his movements.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: It was a night that largely was about Tunsil. The Dolphins get a player who might have gone first overall with the 13th choice. That could be a major steal. But the information that came out Thursday night about Tunsil clearly was enough to make other NFL teams wary. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         14. Oakland Raiders Team needs: OT, S, CB, Interior DL The pick: Karl Joseph | S | West Virginia That’s a significant surprise by the Raiders. Talent evaluators praise Karl Joseph’s   ways at safety. But his   skills are questioned by some, and few prognosticators had him going this early in the draft.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Much improved throughout his career in coverage, his instincts and football smarts have assisted him greatly in that area. He’s a fearless and ruthless hitter and almost always looking for the big hit. He doesn’t always wrap up after contact, throwing a shoulder into a ball carrier instead of making a textbook tackle. He’s not going to be a   type, but he has some range in the middle of the field. He loves the game and consistently studies it.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Some applauded the Raiders’ selection of the   safety. But questions have been raised by some observers about his pass coverage. That’s ominous in today’s   NFL. Grade:    —   Maske     15. Cleveland Browns (from Tennessee) Team needs: QB, WR, RB, T, S The pick: Corey Coleman | WR | Baylor The Browns finally make a pick and give some help to Robert Griffin III by selecting speedy wide receiver (and fellow Baylor alum) Corey Coleman. He becomes the first wideout taken in this draft and he gives Cleveland a potential No. 1 receiver to replace Josh Gordon, who still hasn’t been reinstated by the NFL. But after trading down twice, the Browns still are no closer to having a reliable quarterback of the future.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: There’s potential he goes BOOM at any time. He can catch and run, high point   balls and run under downfield bombs. He’s an adequate route runner, and needs to be disciplined enough to finish it. When he runs his hitch or curl route, his head is looking back before he reaches top of the route, and he lazily gets into his slant route. As such, his   technique needs work. Drafting Coleman puts defenses on vertical ball notice though.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Trading down twice, once before the draft and again Thursday, added picks but came at a cost. The selection of Coleman gives them a prospective No. 1 receiver, but still lack a potential franchise quarterback and the Browns still have done nothing to address that issue, other than signing Robert Griffin III in free agency. Grade: C+  —   Maske     16. Detroit Lions Team needs: OT, MLB, CB The pick: Taylor Decker | T | Ohio State Taylor Decker was the obvious choice here for the Lions. They absolutely had to have an offensive tackle to help in safeguarding Matthew Stafford. That’s four Ohio State players in the draft’s first 16 picks after Joey Bosa, Ezekiel Elliott and Eli Apple went in the top 10.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He played right tackle in 2013 and got completely destroyed by current Oakland Raider star Khalil Mack in his first start   …     that’s a tough way to break into the college ranks though. He’s improved tremendously since that opening game, but I don’t think he’ll succeed at left tackle going forward, nor does he strike me as a guard. He moves well enough to be a tackle, but he can’t or won’t play the left side. He’s got a solid technique working the arc, his kickstep and punch are tight, he stays square to the rusher, but the one thing that would make his technique nearly flawless is if he could drop his butt, sit back and punch more effectively.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Detroit desperately needed offensive line help and got it, choosing Decker precisely when he should have been selected. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         17. Atlanta Falcons Team needs: Edge, LB, S, G The pick: Keanu Neal | S | Florida Is Dan Quinn, the former Seattle defensive coordinator now the head coach in Atlanta, trying to get his version of Kam Chancellor or Earl Thomas with the Falcons by drafting Keanu Neal? It’s a surprise that two pure safeties (in addition to Jalen Ramsey) have been taken in the first 17 picks.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Physically impressive at a little over   and 211 pounds, he put together some strong explosive measurements at the combine. Those around the Florida program were disappointed to lose Neal to the NFL. He was third on the team with 96 tackles (only behind the team’s two starting inside linebackers) and posted four interceptions over the past two seasons. He has length and range, but this dude will strike with a bite of a rattlesnake. He will struggle in man coverage a bit early in his NFL career, but he’s a hitter.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The No. 17 pick seems high, even if he does have “Legion of Boom”  upside. Grade:    —   Maske Draft history         18. Indianapolis Colts Team needs: G, C, T, ILB The pick: Ryan Kelly | C | Alabama The Colts give Andrew Luck a potential mainstay of a center by selecting Ryan Kelly. Is the 18th pick perhaps a little bit too soon to take a center? Maybe. But few talent evaluators question Kelly’s skills. It is interesting that Myles Jack continues to fall through the first round, presumably because of the concerns about the durability of his knee.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Deservedly the first center off the board after showing athleticism, in combination to his overall football skill set. He’s a solid technician that plays with good base and power in the run game. He has excellent technique though and an extremely football intelligent player.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: It’s a good move to protect Andrew Luck, but a center this early in the draft feels like a reach for a need. Grade: B  —    —   Maske Draft history         19. Buffalo Bills Team needs: DE, OT, OLB, QB The pick: Shaq Lawson | DE | Clemson The Bills get a potential defensive   in Shaq Lawson. That’s a good value pick for them at 19th. You have to wonder if they considered Robert Nkemdiche here. They haven’t been reluctant, after all, to add talented players with   issues. The Jets are next at 20th. Will they take Paxton Lynch?  —   Mark Maske What he brings: At first glance, the first thing that stands out is his length. He carries his weight well as he doesn’t look like a   and appears much lighter. I’m not sure he has the quicks to drop and rush on a consistent basis, and I’m not sure he could add    pounds to be a   DE. Overall, he’s excellent against the run, uses his length to get separation and then has the ability to chase and run after the  . And he’s as tough as the day is long.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Buffalo gets a potential defensive   and in Rex Ryan’s hands that’s a good asset. Grade: B  —   Maske     20. New York Jets Team needs: OT, ILB, OLB, QB The pick: Darron Lee | OLB | Ohio State The Jets had their chance to address their quarterback situation by taking Paxton Lynch. They didn’t do it, going instead with Darron Lee. There’s nothing wrong with the pick. He should help the defense. But it’s a   league, and the Jets’ QB situation remains in limbo. They haven’t   Ryan Fitzpatrick. They haven’t traded (so far) for Colin Kaepernick. They have Geno Smith and Bryce Petty on the roster. Is that good enough for a team that just missed the AFC playoffs last season? It doesn’t seem like it. The Jets either are being very patient or very foolish about this, depending on your perspective.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The scouting community is mixed on Lee, it seems, and that doesn’t make a ton of sense to me. The NFL has become an offensively dominated   game. As such, Lee is the defensive chess piece to counter what’s taking place on that side of the ball. He has some size and moves likes a safety. There’s a lot to like in his versatility.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: No one has told the Jets, apparently, that this is a   league. They still have time to fix their quarterback situation. But until they do, they don’t get the benefit of the doubt, even though there was nothing exactly wrong with the choice of Lee. There’s a reason why the Broncos, who got their QB Thursday night, win Super Bowls and the Jets don’t. Grade D+  —   Maske Draft history         21. Houston Texans (from Washington) Team needs: Speed (everywhere) Interior OL, DE The pick: Will Fuller | WR | Notre Dame The Texans trade up a spot (with the Redskins) and get a wide receiver to go with DeAndre Hopkins. That was expected. It is interesting that their wideout of choice here was Will Fuller, not Josh Doctson or Laquon Treadwell.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: One number tells you all you need to know: 4. 32. He flew down the Lucas Oil Stadium track with the second best time of the entire combine. Game Over. He had a dominating 2014 season in South Bend but was even better in 2015, making every clutch catch in every tight situation in every close game during the season. He doesn’t always trust his hands and will leap to make body catches, instead of snatching the rock out of the air. Combined with a lack of size, that could work against him.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The trade up one pick just seems a little odd, but the Texans get a speedy receiver to pair with Hopkins and give Brock Osweiler two good targets. Grade: B  —   Maske     22. Washington Redskins (from Houston) Team needs: DL, C, ILB, WR The pick: Josh Doctson | WR | TCU The Redskins add at a position of strength by taking Josh Doctson when they already have DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon and Jamison Crowder at receiver. This is an illustration that draft picks are not made only for one season. The Redskins have an obvious need for a   defensive lineman. But this draft is deep along the defensive line and the Redskins can come back to that. Elsewhere in the draft, Paxton Lynch and Myles Jack remain available. Will the Broncos be able to get their quarterback? At what point will Jack’s obvious talent outweigh the concerns about the durability of his knee?  —   Mark Maske    Despite needs along the defensive line and at center, the Washington Redskins took the best player available. (Thomas   Washington Post)   What he brings: He’s fast enough, but his game is more as an acrobatic,      receiver. Quite simply, if the ball is anywhere near him, he’ll come down with it. Washington will love him down in the red zone. He reminds me of Texans WR DeAndre Hopkins with his hands and body control near the end zone. I rarely saw college DBs push him off the spot or impede his routes. Early evaluation: The defense still needs work and the Redskins have talent and depth at wideout. But this is a   play, and there still is time in this draft to address the needs on defense. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         23. Minnesota Vikings Team needs: WR, OL The pick: Laquon Treadwell | WR | Mississippi The Vikings selecting Laquon Treadwell is a sensible,    choice. They needed another wide receiver to help their young quarterback, Teddy Bridgewater, and this was the portion of the opening round in which the wideouts were expected to come off the board quickly. Unfortunately for the Bengals, who are up next and lost Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu in free agency, the top four wide receivers are now gone.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He’s the prototype,   big receiver, but he won’t run away from cornerbacks or get a ton of separation in his routes. He’s excellent after the catch but he has ability to make defensive backs and linebackers miss in space. He   the football down the field and he really is more of a downfield receiver. He can adjust to any throw against any coverage and is very dynamic.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: The Vikings needed a receiver and got a potentially very good one. Grade: B  —   Maske     24. Cincinnati Bengals Team needs: WR, OLB, DT, OL The pick: William Jackson III | CB | Houston It figured that the Bengals would consider a wide receiver after losing Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu in free agency. But the top four wideouts (Corey Coleman, Will Fuller, Josh Doctson and Laquon Treadwell) already are gone. The Redskins might have messed things up for Cincinnati by taking Doctson. Getting William Jackson makes sense under the circumstances.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Long and rangy and confident at every level of the passing game. He’s a defensive back that wants to be involved in run support. He doesn’t pack a wallop, but doesn’t shy from contact either. His trail technique needs a little work and gets lazy in zone coverage. But I’m not playing him in zone going forward. I want him challenging receivers with his length and size, all day, every day.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Many thought the Bengals would take a wide receiver but they had the misfortune of picking just after wideouts were taken with three straight picks. Instead, they went with a cornerback who was well worth the 24th selection. Grade: B+  —   Maske     25. Pittsburgh Steelers Team needs: CB, OT, TE, NT The pick: Artie Burns | CB | Miami It’s no surprise whatsoever that the Steelers went with a cornerback. With William Jackson gone, getting Artie Burns is the right move for them. The Broncos have traded up to 26th, presumably to take a quarterback. Paxton Lynch? If not Lynch, then maybe Connor Cook.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Long arms are a major asset and advantage for the   junior. His track background has given him excellent recovery speed. He’s not going to be a star in run support but not afraid of contact. I love his ability to find the football in the air and contest the multitude of passes that he does. He might not be a   name, and I had him as a Day 2 selection, but he can play.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Pittsburgh needed help in the secondary and added a cornerback who could turn out to be a significant contributor. Grade: B  —   Maske Draft history         26. Denver Broncos (from Seattle) Team needs: QB, OT, ILB The pick: Paxton Lynch | QB | Memphis The Broncos have their quarterback. They traded up five spots in the opening round to get Paxton Lynch of Memphis with the 26th overall selection. After losing Peyton Manning to retirement and Brock Osweiler to free agency, the Super Bowl champs now have traded for Mark Sanchez and drafted Lynch. They apparently explored possible trades for Colin Kaepernick and Sam Bradford without completing either deal. It remains to be seen if those trade deliberations are off for good. Is Lynch ready to start as a rookie? Some talent evaluators say no. If not, Sanchez potentially could be the temporary starter. Lynch, at    is a big quarterback in the mold of Osweiler. Jon Gruden has likened Lynch’s size and athleticism to the physical traits possessed by Cam Newton.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: The tall pocket passer, or so it seems. My broadcast partner, Andre Ware, called Memphis’s win over Ole Miss and said, “That joker can make any throw out on the field. Any. Throw. ” He does rush some throws at times and the ball placement can be off when he’s out of rhythm. But he has a plus arm.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: Chief roster architect John Elway didn’t panic when Peyton Manning retired and Brock Osweiler exited in free agency. He took his time. He explored possible trades and found them too expensive. He traded earlier for Mark Sanchez and when he had his chance Thursday night to trade up to draft Lynch, he seized the opportunity. Maybe the Broncos still have another QB move in them; maybe they don’t. But Elway has given the team an intriguing prospect for the future and a temporary starter if needed. Grade: A  —   Maske     27. Green Bay Packers Team needs: OLB, DE,   TE The pick: Kenny Clark | DT | UCLA It’s no shock the Packers take a defensive tackle, with B. J. Raji not playing this season. Going with Kenny Clark is a much safer pick than selecting the talented Robert Nkemdiche would have been, given his   issues. Green Bay also goes with Clark over Andrew Billings, Jarran Reed and A’Shawn Robinson.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Tipping the scales at 314 pounds and running a 5. 06   dash? Yeah, that’s impressive. He put up 29 reps of 225 pounds on the bench and had a 28.  vertical leap. But, it was doing field work where he really stood out. His power and quickness were highly evident at the combine. He remains in constant motion, never takes plays off and is ultra quick up the field. He plays the nose a good majority of the time but with his strength he could move out to star as a   DE   or   in due time.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: This pick is fine, but will be judged in time against how those other three interior defensive linemen (Billings, Reed and Robinson) perform in the NFL. Grade:    —   Maske Draft history         28. San Francisco 49ers (from Kansas City) Team needs: QB, OT, WR, CB The pick: Joshua Garnett | OG | Stanford The 49ers traded back up into the first round to take a guard? Really? Has Chip Kelly staged another coup and taken over GM duties in another organization?  —   Mark Maske What he brings: No. 62 on my board, so this feels high. At the Senior Bowl, Garnett faced a ton of   interior defensive stalwarts. He was good in the run game for the most part, but his pass protection left a bit to be desired. When   he will straight up maul defenders. He’s not horribly fleet of foot but can pull to the opposite side and get a helmet on a different colored jersey.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: See pick No. 7.     29. Arizona Cardinals Team needs: DT, S, C, CB The pick: Robert Nkemdiche |   | Ole Miss So Robert Nkemdiche gets taken in the first round after all. He is among the most talented players in this draft and is a potentially dominant defensive lineman. But his   issues, including his suspension from the Sugar Bowl after his   fall, clearly scared off many teams. Bruce Arians is among the league’s best and most   coaches. If he can make things work with Nkemdiche, this pick will end up being a steal for the Cardinals.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: He can dominate when he wants to. His power is at a completely different level, but it’s kept him from learning how to effectively use his hands or learn effective ways of getting off blocks to rush the passer. He plays with low pad level and is built like a tank. He knifes into the backfield with his quickness. Upside and potential? Certainly. Major question marks? Unfortunately yes.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: By this point in the first round, Nkemdiche’s talent makes the risk of taking him, given his   issues, worth it. Grade: B+  —   Maske     30. Carolina Panthers Team needs: OT, DE, RB, CB The pick: Vernon Butler | DT | La. Tech The Panthers removed their   tag from cornerback Josh Norman in part because they prefer to devote their resources on defense to fortifying their front seven. That was on display with this pick. Never mind that Norman is gone and there is a clear need at cornerback. Carolina added to a position of strength, at defensive tackle, by choosing Vernon Butler.  —   Mark Maske What he brings: Apparently, he really impressed teams with his interview sessions at the combine. There wasn’t much in his testing results that got much attention, but he did shine at the Senior Bowl. He’s so quick upfield he gave offensive line fits in    drills against the run. He struggled just a bit rushing the passer from different angles. Muhammed Wilkerson isn’t a bad comparable.  —   John Harris Early evaluation: You have to say this for the Panthers: They stick to their plan.

Germain Ifedi could end up playing guard rather than tackle at the NFL level. But he certainly should help.

I was surprised, a bit, that he decided to declare for the draft. He’s seemingly best suited to be a guard, but he wasn’t going to play guard at A&M in 2016, so it might’ve been best to take off for the NFL. Honestly, he didn’t have the best season in 2015.

"     Editor’s note: This is part 1 of a   series. “To this day, if you live in Kershaw County and saw those media reports, you’d still think Lori Jean Ellis was just some crazy old black lady who opened fire on a bunch of cops,” says Robert Phillips. “You’d think she got what she deserved. ” Phillips is an attorney in Rock Hill, S. C. just across the border from Charlotte. He represented Ellis’s estate in a lawsuit after her death. Ellis, 52, was killed on April 21, 2008, when an officer from the state’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and two Kershaw County sheriff’s deputies served a series of warrants on her home at about 11 pm. In the ongoing national discussion about police brutality and lethal force, a common reform recommended by advocacy and activist groups is that police shootings be investigated by an outside organization. Police agencies shouldn’t be trusted to investigate internally, the thinking goes, and prosecutors are too close to and dependent on local police to be impartial. Wisconsin recently passed a bill requiring all police shootings investigations be led by a law enforcement agency other than those involved in the shooting. The new policy has been   by both police groups and advocates for reform. But the practice of outside agencies investigating   shootings has already long been common in South Carolina. With the exception of Richland County, all police shootings in the state are investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) the   police department that’s commonly seen as the state’s version of the FBI. In addition to   shootings, SLED has a panoply of other responsibilities, including terrorism investigations, technical training for other agencies, drug investigations, support for local agencies, arson investigations and alcohol regulation. SLED also conducts statewide investigations at the request of the governor or attorney general. Currently, local police agencies invite SLED in to investigate   shootings as a sort of custom, but the South Carolina legislature is now considering a bill that would require this in all   shootings in the state. But within South Carolina, attorneys who handle police abuse cases say that not only isn’t the model working, it may be allowing wayward law enforcement officers and agencies to operate with a sense of invincibility. Policing experts who reviewed the Ellis shooting and several other cases for this series seemed to agree: The model isn’t working. There is no doubt that a proper oversight agency can do a lot of good. But an inept one can do a lot of harm  —   especially an inept agency that’s perceived as competent. On the night Lori Jean Ellis died, DNR Officer Gregg Lowery and Deputy William Sowell arrived at her home first, then radioed Deputy Tyrell Coleman for backup. According to the officers, they then rode Lowery’s mostly unmarked DNR truck over Ellis’ fence and around to the back of her home. They then maced her dog. They claimed to have called out to Ellis several times. When she didn’t respond, they ripped open her back door with an animal control pole. That’s when they say Ellis fired a   rifle at them, and they responded with gunfire. Lowery fired two shots: one missed, and one grazed the top of Ellis’s shoulder. Coleman fired the fatal shot, which struck Ellis in the back of the head. The next day, Kershaw County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Cpl. David Thomley told WISTV in Columbia that Ellis had an “extensive criminal history” dating back to 1972. He told WLTX TV that the officers “knew of her violent past so it was absolutely a necessity to have more than one officer go out there. ” He added that the county’s residents should be both thankful for the officers’ sacrifice and grateful that they escaped the raid unharmed. “It’s also unfortunate for these officers that had to go through that and it’s gonna be a tough time for them as well, but at the same time, you have to stop and give thanks that it didn’t turn out any differently,” he said. Within hours SLED investigators were on the scene in Kershaw County. The three deputies signed their statements at 2:20 a. m. the morning after the raid. Lowery described seeing a puff of smoke from the barrel of Ellis’s gun. Coleman stated that he saw a muzzle flash. Sowell wrote that he heard a shot, and would later say his face was less than 10 feet away from the gun barrel when she fired what sounded to him like an SKS   rifle, a weapon similar to an  . All three officers claimed to have seen Ellis pointing the gun at them.     months later, SLED sent its report to W. Barney Giese, then the solicitor for South Carolina’s Fifth Judicial District. (In South Carolina, district attorneys are called solicitors.) Based on SLED’s report, Giese determined that the two officers who shot Lori Jean Ellis “were in reasonable fear for their lives,” and therefore “were justified in discharging their firearms. ” All three officers were cleared of any wrongdoing. (Giese, incidentally, is now in private practice. He’s currently the defense attorney for Sean Groubert, the former state trooper now awaiting sentencing for shooting unarmed motorist Levar Jones during a traffic stop. He did not return a request for comment.)    A Google Earth view of Ellis’s home in 2008. (Courtesy of Robert Phillips)  Despite Giese’s decision, one needn’t delve too far into the case to see some red flags. The warrant for which Officer Lowery went to Ellis’s home that night was a bench warrant for failure to appear in court for an open container violation. The officers also found three other outstanding warrants for Ellis, but all for what might be called “poverty crimes”  —   nonviolent crimes more the result of having little money than criminal intent. One was for driving on a suspended license, another for failure to turn over a suspended license and the last was for bouncing a $219 check. Oddly, Officer Lowery was off duty on the night of the raid. According to deposition transcripts, earlier in the day he had attended a city employee appreciation event on the other side of the county. Phillips estimates that Lowery drove about two hours out of his way to pull and serve the open container warrant on Ellis. The biggest red flag of all was that   rifle that all three officers claimed they saw, the one that allegedly produced a muzzle flash, smoke and a   boom  —   the equivalent of standing about 10 feet behind a jet engine. But Ellis’s gun wasn’t an an SKS rifle, or an   or a firearm at all. It was a BB gun. Because a pellet gun uses air pressure instead of gunpowder to propel its projectile, it isn’t capable of producing a muzzle flash, a loud boom or a plume of smoke. The state crime lab also found no fingerprints on the weapon, according to the SLED report, despite the fact that the shellacked wood from which it was made should have been conducive to retaining prints. In fact, the lab couldn’t even get the gun to function. The more Phillips dug, the more problems he found. There was plenty of evidence inconsistent with the officers’ narrative. The bullet trajectories (as calculated by SLED investigators, then confirmed by investigators for Phillips) rendered the officers’ version of events next to impossible. And then there were the tactics themselves: Why did the officers drive a black, mostly unmarked DNR truck at 11:00 p. m. at night through Ellis’s fence and into her backyard, mace her dog, and rip open her door with an animal control pole, all to serve misdemeanor warrants for nonviolent crimes? Such stories about botched raids, questionable police shootings and implausible statements from law enforcement officers aren’t uncommon. But there was an additional and especially troubling component to Ellis’s death. SLED investigators are supposed to be objective and impartial. Yet when looking into Ellis’s death, they didn’t pursue any of these inconsistencies, contradictions or questionable tactics.    Lori Jean Ellis’s trailer at night, shortly after her death. (Photo: Courtesy of Robert Phillips)  Ellis certainly did have a criminal record, mostly for bouncing checks and failure to pay fines for traffic violations. She had a couple arrests for domestic violence, which Phillips says was the result of a relationship that while sometimes volatile, wasn’t actually violent. “They’d have arguments, get angry, and one would call the cops on the other,” Phillips says. None of those arrests resulted in a conviction. Ellis’s only felony conviction was possessing a car that had been reported stolen. Phillips looked into the allegation and thinks that too was the result of an argument. “In poorer parts of South Carolina, people don’t sell cars with all the paperwork. So someone doesn’t pay someone back, or bounces a check for the agreed amount of the sale, and the seller might report the car stolen. It isn’t like she   some car off the street. ” Ellis was convicted and given a sentence that was suspended if she paid the balance of what she owed on the car  —   about $400. Ellis was also a veteran who served as a nurse in the first Gulf War and suffered from PTSD as a result, according to Phillips. She appears to have medicated with alcohol. One neighbor who otherwise remembered Ellis fondly added that she was often intoxicated, although not in a threatening way. She mostly lived off her pension and disability benefit. Neighbors described her as kind and generous with what she had. Ellis loved animals, and kept a lot of them on her property  —   chickens, pigs, goats, the occasional llama. In one deposition given several years later, a neighbor likened Ellis’s home to Noah’s ark. Ellis had no children of her own, but she welcomed neighbor children to her house. Photos of the inside of her apartment the night she died showed a collection of toys. She’d sometimes surprise her neighbors by mowing their lawns while they were away. In 2013, Kershaw County settled with Ellis’s estate for $2 million  —   a hefty sum for a county of 60, 000 people. It’s an especially large settlement given that Ellis had no close relatives and died almost instantly. Damages are typically based on the survivors’ relationship to the victim, and the amount of pain and suffering the victim endured. In Ellis’s case, the money went to several   she hadn’t seen in years. Nor did Ellis suffer much. She died within seconds. “The county knew this was bad,” Phillips says. “They wanted this case to go away. ” Outside oversight: no panacea “There are two things you’re looking for by having an outside agency investigate these shootings,” says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who now studies law enforcement and police law at the University of South Carolina School of Law. “You want the appearance of independence  —   you want the investigation to be legitimate in the eyes of the public. But you also want actual accuracy and objectivity. You need to have both. ” An outside agency that doesn’t have both may be worse than no outside agency at all. If the investigating agency has only the reputation of integrity and independence, but doesn’t demonstrate either in practice, misconduct doesn’t just go unpunished, it gets papered over. The public gets a false sense of security. Watchdog groups, journalists and social justice groups may be less likely to question shootings, or they’ll be taken less seriously when they do. That can create a culture in which abuse and corruption flourish. Phillips, other attorneys across the state who have represented victims of police brutality and policing experts consulted for this series say there are signs that this is what’s happening in South Carolina. “I like most cops,” says Brian Gambrel, an attorney in Columbia who has litigated police abuse cases. “We need cops. I think most cops are   people who have tough jobs and try to do the right thing. But we let the bad cops get away with things here. The policies I’m talking about don’t protect the   hardworking cops, they protect the bad ones. Some of them start to think they’re bulletproof. ” Judging by recent headlines, South Carolina would seem to be a place where police shootings are taken seriously and where officers who shoot in error are held accountable. In just the past two years, two   shootings resulted in criminal charges for a police officer: the shooting of Walter Scott by North Charleston police officer Michael Slager last April, and the shooting of Levar Jones by former state trooper Sean Groubert in September. Both shootings were caught on video, and both initially resulted in murder charges for the police officers. Earlier this month, Groubert pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. He faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Slager was indicted for murder in June. His trial is scheduled for October. There have been other incidents, too. In late 2014, Eutawville’s   chief Richard Combs was charged with murder for killing unarmed Walter Bailey near a courthouse in 2011. After one mistrial, Combs in September pleaded guilty to misconduct. He was sentenced to a year of home detention. And next month, North Augusta Officer Justin Craven is due to be tried on felony charges for killing    Ernest Satterwhite. Craven had tried to pull Satterwhite over on suspicion of driving under the influence. Satterwhite instead drove home. As he approached Satterwhite’s car, Craven claims to have seen Satterwhite reaching for a gun. He fired through the   window, killing Satterwhite. But Satterwhite was unarmed. In each of these cases, the police officer was white, the shooting victim was black, and the victim was unarmed. (UPDATE: Earlier this month, Craven pled guilty to “misconduct in office”  —   a misdemeanor.) These particular   cases from just the past few years seem to suggest that at least parts of South Carolina are more willing than most jurisdictions around the country to charge police officers with crimes after unjustified shootings and other incidents of excessive force. But critics like Phillips say they’re the exceptions that prove the rule. They argue that these are just especially egregious examples that attracted national attention and scrutiny, and that  —   with the exception of the Bailey shooting  —   have been captured on video. Richard Harpootlian, a former Fifth Judicial Circuit solicitor who now works in private practice, says SLED investigations can be hit or miss, depending on the investigating agents. “You have regional officers who handle these cases, sometimes involving a department they used to work for,” he says. “It used to be that cops thought internal affairs departments were out to get them, that the investigators were looking to put a notch in their belt. SLED often errs too far the other way. We need something in between. ” SLED investigations also only look at whether police officers committed a crime. They don’t look for civil rights or constitutional violations, or for patterns of excessive force with a particular police officer or agency, and they don’t make judgments about questionable tactics or    policies. But they’re commonly seen as the last word in these cases. A SLED investigation may only clear a police officer of criminal wrongdoing, but the public perception is that if SLED investigated and the cop was cleared, there’s nothing more to discuss. To complicate matters, the final word on whether or not to charge a police officer rests not with SLED, but with the local solicitor. So when it comes to making the decision on whether to press charges, the alleged independence that comes with a SLED investigation is no longer relevant. “The local solicitors work with law enforcement every day,” says Harpootlian. “Those relationships can distort the sort of justice that you get in these cases. ” A solicitor can decline to press charges even when SLED finds significant wrongdoing on the part of a police officer. The Zachary Hammond case is a good example. Hammond was shot and killed by Seneca police officer Lt. Mark Tiller in a fast food parking lot last July. According to Eric Bland, who represented Hammond’s family in their lawsuit, the SLED investigation found that Tiller put himself in harm’s way, then engaged in unnecessarily reckless behavior when he shot and killed Hammond as the teenager drove away. But two months later, 10th Judicial Circuit Solicitor Chrissy Adams declined to press charges against Tiller. “We were mostly satisfied with the SLED report,” says Bland. “There were some problems with transparency, but the report itself was comprehensive. It was the solicitor’s refusal to press charges that was baffling. ” This can create a double layer of protection from criminal liability for the state’s law enforcement officers. If SLED finds no evidence of a crime, it’s unlikely that a local prosecutor will conduct a separate investigation. But even when SLED finds wrongdoing on the part of a police officer, which is rare, the local prosecutor  —   the same prosecutor that works with that department on a daily basis  —   can still decline to indict. “In the end, I think police officers in South Carolina get the sort of presumption of innocence that everyone ought to get,” says Harpootlian. “Unfortunately, it’s only police officers who seem to get it. ” An empty investigation The death of Lori Jean Ellis is a vivid illustration of the problem. Though SLED investigators showed up at the scene of the shooting within hours, the three officers were then permitted to sit in a room together unmonitored before a SLED investigator interviewed them and took their statements. That already is problematic. “You just don’t do that,” says law professor Stoughton. “It’s investigation 101, whether you’re investigating police officers, suspects, or witnesses. You separate them to be sure you get independent statements. ” But a recent investigation by a team of reporters at the (Charleston) Post and Courier found that SLED routinely lets officers collaborate, talk to their attorneys and take a night or two to “sleep on it” before they’re asked to give a statement or sit for an interview. One officer was allowed to wait 28 days before giving a statement. Others gave statements via email.    The truck used to raid Lori Jean Ellis’s home. (From the SLED report)  Despite the fact that there were five houses around Ellis’s, SLED investigators only interviewed one of her neighbors. One neighbor they didn’t interview, a juvenile justice officer and former corrections officer, would later testify in a deposition that she heard the raid go down. By her account, there were just three shots fired, not four, which would have been necessary to verify the officers’ account. (She did say she heard an initial shot well before she heard the subsequent three shots in a row. Phillips believes one of the deputies initially shot out the security light in Ellis’s yard. The officers say it was shot out by the SWAT team that responded after the raid. The neighbor’s account corroborates Phillips’s theory.) The SLED investigators did take measurements of the bullet trajectories, but they made no apparent effort to determine whether the trajectories were consistent with the officers’ accounts. A more thorough investigation would have found that trajectories strongly suggest that the raid couldn’t have happened the way the officers claim it did. Deputies Coleman and Sowell said Ellis was standing at the door with her gun when she fired at them; Lowery claimed she pointed it at them as she charged down a short hallway. But based on the trajectory and height of the bullet that grazed her shoulder, for Ellis to have been at the door when the officers fired their weapons, her shoulder would had to have been less than three feet off the ground. When standing, Ellis’s shoulder was 5 feet from the ground. By the officers’ version of events, she would have had to have been in a   position. That isn’t a natural position to stand under any scenario, but certainly not while holding a rifle. On the night of the shooting Ellis’s   percentage was . 28. So it’s also unlikely stance for a woman who was severely intoxicated. According to an animation of the raid based on the bullet trajectories commissioned by the officers’ own attorneys, it also seems unlikely that the officers could have see Ellis through her doorway at all. From the position where Lowery and Coleman fired their guns, there’s no line of sight to the back doorway. In fact, the only officer who could have seen through the doorway was Sowell, who was in the back of the truck. He was the one officer who didn’t fire.    This reconstruction, commissioned by the Kershaw County officers’ own attorney, is based on measurements taken by South Carolina Law Enforcement Division investigators. (Robert Phillips)   The trailer itself was also pitch black. There were no lights on inside, and Ellis’s home is in a rural area with no ambient light. One plaintiff’s expert who visited the trailer at night described the conditions as “total darkness. ” Phillips and the experts he hired believe Ellis was likely in a drunken sleep in her bedroom when the officers arrived, shot out her security light and maced her dog. She likely awoke when they ripped open her door and proceeded to her bedroom door to see what was happening. They say the forensic evidence suggests she was standing behind her bedroom door when the first bullet went through the outer wall to the trailer, through the door and grazed the top of her shoulder. That’s consistent with the bullet trajectories, as well as a fresh scratch on her face that was consistent with a piece of wood found in the bedroom that was ejected from the door as the bullet went through it. Phillips and his experts believe Ellis opened the bedroom door and walked toward the back door to investigate the commotion, then likely turned and retreated back to her bedroom when she realized she was being fired upon. That’s likely when Deputy Coleman’s bullet struck her in the back of the head. As for the BB gun, it was found in the doorway. That’s consistent with testimony from Ishmail Stokes, Ellis’s boyfriend at the time, that she kept the gun leaning against the door frame so it would be handy when she needed to scare off wild animals. “My guess is that when they pried open the door, the gun fell, and one of the offices yelled ‘Gun! ,’” Phillips says. “And then Lowery and Coleman panicked and fired their weapons. ” Ellis’s gun is also the subject of some of the more disturbing shortcomings in the SLED investigation. Once the agents learned that the rifle was a pellet gun, not a   firearm, impartial investigators should have tried to   the deputies to ask them to explain the discrepancy. How could they have seen a muzzle flash, seen smoke and heard a deafening sound from a pellet gun that was incapable of producing any of those things? The SLED investigators never asked any of these questions. In incredible depositions taken of the SLED investigators in 2011 and 2012, Phillips tried to figure out why they didn’t. In one exchange, Phillips asked SLED captain Paul Grant, who supervised the SLED investigators in the case, if the officers would have been justified in shooting Ellis if she had never fired her “weapon. ” Grant refused to speculate. Phillips pressed him. What Grant said next is remarkable. Phillips: Let’s just assume these cops aren’t telling the truth . . . Grant: But they are telling the truth. Phillips: How do you know that? Grant: Because they’re police officers and I believe what they’re telling me . . .    Excerpt from video deposition of South Carolina Law Enforcement Division captain Paul Grant, taken in the case Blakely vs. Kershaw County Sherriff’s Office, et. al. (Robert Phillips)   Grant believes them, simply because they’re police officers. “I understand why an investigator might feel some some camaraderie with the police officers he’s investigating,” says Stoughton. “But his job isn’t to clear these officers. It’s to develop an objective record of facts to determine if they committed a crime. ” Stephen Downing, a former deputy chief of police for the Los Angeles Police Department who now advocates for police and drug reform, is far more blunt. “He is incompetent,” Downing said after reviewing the case. “He doesn’t know the difference between an opinion and a fact, yet he treats a police officer’s statement as fact. His bias is transparent and rather ugly. ” Later in the deposition, Phillips asked Grant about the muzzle flash, the sound and the smoke the officers claimed to have seen from the pellet gun. “So when this one says ‘I saw something like smoke come out of the end of the gun,’ that didn’t cause you any concern at all?” Grant replied, “No. ” Phillips then turned to Coleman’s claim to have seen a muzzle flush. Phillips: Have you ever seen a BB gun or a pellet gun create a flash? Grant: I haven’t. Phillips: Have you ever seen a   rifle create a flash? Grant: I haven’t seen one, but I know they probably do. Phillips: So the deputy involved in the shooting says, “I saw a flash,” and then the next day we find out that it wasn’t a   rifle, it was actually a BB gun. That didn’t cause you any concern? Grant: No. Phillips: And why not? Grant: The officer thinks he’s being shot at by a   rifle. We’re all unable to see the same things. I’ve seen that over my years of experience. If something happened in this room right there, all of us are not going to recount it the same way. Phillips tried the question from a different angle. He got the same result. Phillips: Okay, let me ask if you this. If something happens in this room, and one of us testified to something that was physically impossible, do you think all of us are being truthful? Grant: I can’t answer that either. I’m saying that you see things a certain way than somebody else sees it. Phillips pressed on. He asked if Grant believed the statements from the officers about seeing a flash, seeing smoke and hearing a shot from the BB gun were “highly unlikely. ” Grant replied, “No. I would not agree. ” Phillips asked why not. Grant replied, “Because people see things differently. We’ve got three differently people who see things differently. The bottom line is, they all saw a   rifle being pointed out the door at them. ”    Excerpt from video deposition of South Carolina Law Enforcement Division captain Paul Grant, taken in the case Blakely vs. Kershaw County Sherriff’s Office, et. al. (Robert Phillips)   Grant didn’t say the officers claimed to see a   rifle. He said they did see one. He took everything the officers said at face value. Their word was truth, and the investigation proceeded from there. “All he is doing here is shrugging and saying, ‘that’s what he said,’” says Downing. “If that is all that is needed in a competent investigation, then you don’t need an investigator with 20 years’ experience. A note taker would suffice. ” Stoughton sees the exchange similarly: “This isn’t a matter of trusting or believing the officers. If they’re claiming to have seen things that couldn’t have happened, you have to at least try to determine if those claims are reasonable. If they aren’t, then you have a problem. ” Paul Grant was later promoted, and is now listed as the assistant chief of SLED. Phillips’s deposition of SLED chief case officer James Flowers produced the same sorts of answers. Flowers wouldn’t admit that a pellet gun is incapable of producing a flash. He conceded only that he personally has never seen it happen. Phillips continued: Phillips: So did anything prevent you, from the moment that you found out it was a mere BB gun, to say, “I want to go back and talk to this deputy . . . ” Flowers: Nothing prevented me from doing that. Phillips: Okay. Why didn’t you go back? Flowers: Because I didn’t feel it necessary. Phillips: So someone telling you something that you’ve never seen before, that doesn’t compel you to maybe follow up? Flowers: No. Not in all cases . . . Phillips:  . . . so if I tell you something that can’t physically happen, you’re just going to take my word for it? Flowers: See, here’s the thing. As the lead investigator for the state’s premiere law enforcement agency, it is my responsibility to put this case together. After looking at this information, I deemed that it was not necessary to interview that officer again. And that was the decision that I made.    Excerpt from video deposition of South Carolina Law Enforcement Division Agent James Flowers, taken in the case Blakely vs. Kershaw County Sherriff’s Office, et. al. (Robert Phillips)   “The arrogance here is stunning,” Downing says. “This response either reveals Flowers’s incompetence or his bias. Either way he should not be conducting investigations of   shootings. ” Later, Phillips asked Flowers what   process he went through to conclude that it wasn’t necessary to follow up on the portions of the officers’ statements that directly contradicted the forensic evidence. Flowers replied, “I looked at the information, and I didn’t deem it necessary. It’s pretty much  —   it’s pretty simple, honestly. ” Flowers gave a similar answer when Phillips asked why he only interviewed one neighbor when there were five houses that had lines of sight to the shooting. He simply didn’t think he needed to. Flowers also admitted he wasn’t aware of the bullet that grazed Ellis’s shoulder. He thought the bullet that killed her was the only bullet that struck her. He also didn’t know which officer fired the fatal bullet, and he mistakenly believed that one of the bullets had gone through Ellis’s front door. (They all went through the wall to the side of the door, which is why it would have been difficult for the officers to have seen Ellis when they fired their weapons.) Flowers also admitted he never saw or inspected Ellis’s gun. He admitted that he hadn’t read the entire forensics reports  —   nor does he in most of the cases he investigates. Phillips: Well, when you signed off on [the SLED report]  —   Flowers:  . Phillips:   —   had you read the firearms, the latent prints, and the fingerprints  —   Flowers: No. Phillips:  —   report? Flowers: I don’t read those whole reports, no. Phillips: You don’t read these reports? Flowers: No. Phillips: Why is that? Flowers: I get a synopsis of those reports from the people who provide  —   who do those reports. Phillips: That’s not procedure for you to read what’s in these reports? Flowers: Not those full reports, no. Phillips: Why is that? Flowers: That’s just how it is. This testimony would be unnerving enough if it had come from a sheriff or police chief. But Flowers was working for the agency in charge of investigating police shootings. And he was talking about a case for which he was the lead investigator. “You absolutely have to read the forensic evidence,” says Stoughton, the law professor. “You can’t conduct a proper investigation if you don’t. ” Two months prior to the raid on Ellis’ home, Lowery was involved in another incident in which he discharged his weapon but failed to report it. He was suspended for five days by the Department of Natural Resources. The SLED investigators didn’t look into that incident as part of their investigation of the Ellis shooting, even though it may have raised questions about Lowery’s credibility. Ken Katsaris, a former law enforcement officer and trainer with over 30 years of experience, was another of Phillips’s experts for Ellis’s family. Katsaris is no hired gun for plaintiffs. He testifies in defense of police officers about three times more often than he testifies against them. He also wrote one of the reports that cleared the officer who shot Tamir Rice. In this case, Katsaris seem baffled by what he learned. In his deposition, Katsaris said the idea that an officer investigating a police shooting wouldn’t read all of the forensics reports is “almost beyond incredible. ” Then Katsaris laid into Flowers: [Flowers] says it is not important to interview the officers about whether Ms. Ellis actually fired the gun or not. Not important. He never looked at the fingerprint reports. He has no opinions about whether the gun was or was not fired. He has never even seen the gun that Ms. Ellis had. He has no idea whether the gun that Ms. Ellis has can smoke or flash. He’s the case agent. He’s turning this over to the solicitor. You’ve got a gun that conceivably doesn’t smoke and certainly doesn’t flash, and he doesn’t even know. He didn’t ask questions about whether the gun flashed or smoked or that the officer said that the gun flashed and smoked . . . He got information after the fact, and even though it was contraindicated to what the officer said, he said he didn’t go back and ask any   questions. He said his decision about following up is just something that is not necessary no matter what you find out. He found it irrelevant to interview witnesses at the scene who may be there or who may have heard something. He doesn’t even have an answer as to why the neighbors weren’t interviewed . . . He doesn’t actually know which officer actually shot Ms. Ellis. He’s giving the solicitor information about whether a crime or not has occurred. He doesn’t even know at the time of his deposition which officer actually shot. He says it’s not important to know the trajectory or shot placement. Not important. He doesn’t know about the bullet holes or the trajectory. He said angles of the trajectory are not troubling to him. He said he never looked for an explanation on how her gun could have flashed. Lowery also told SLED investigators that he had made several prior attempts to serve the warrants (the first of which was issued on April 2) on Ellis during the daytime, but she had avoided him. But while Lowery’s worklogs for April 2008 included such items as inspecting boats, litter duty, checking the bait in turkey traps and attending city employee appreciation parties, they make no mention of attempts to serve the bench warrants for Ellis. That’s surprising, given that the police would later describe Ellis essentially as a violent fugitive. Notably, it was Phillips who obtained Lowery’s worklogs during discovery for the lawsuit. It’s another inconsistency in the officers’ story that SLED investigators never checked out. More protectors than investigators Last year, an investigation by Clif LeBlanc of The State newspaper in Columbia found that of the 209 incidents in which South Carolina police officers fired their weapons over the previous five years, only a few resulted in criminal charges. Those few cases had only occurred over the previous year or so, and none to that point had resulted in a conviction. The paper consulted attorneys who in prosecutor’s offices and others who defend police officers accused of misconduct. All told the paper that until 2014, they couldn’t remember a single instance in which a police officer had been charged for a shooting. Of course, that could because all or almost all of those police shootings were justified. The State noted that “the vast majority of the suspects shot at in South Carolina during the past five years have been armed. ” That’s consistent with national FBI data showing that the vast majority of police shootings involved armed suspects. But that would also mean that the state’s law enforcement officers only recently began shooting people without justification. That seems unlikely. The other, more likely, possibility: It’s been happening all along, but the emergence of video has forced state officials to take a closer look. The State also noted that in most shooting cases, “records  …    are sometimes incomplete, which leaves key details to be ferreted from individual police agencies. ” The Ellis shooting demonstrates why those details are so critical to assessing the legitimacy of a police shooting  —   and why “armed suspect” statistics can be so misleading. For the purposes of the FBI data, Ellis would have been considered “armed. ” That says very little about her death, the unanswered questions about the events leading up to it, or whether the officers were justified in shooting her. “Too often, SLED investigators don’t question inconsistencies in reports or statements from police officers,” says defense attorney Christopher Mills. “They’ll let the officer corroborate their stories. They’re great at finding evidence that clears police, but you don’t see much effort to find evidence that incriminates them. There was a time when internal affairs officers were disliked by other police officers. In South Carolina, other cops tend to see SLED investigators as their protectors. ” The current head of SLED, Mark Keel, has said made some public statements that seem to support Mills’s characterization of the agency as more of a protector of law enforcement officers. As part of its investigation last year, The State newspaper interviewed Keel. Paraphrasing him, the paper wrote that he “worries . . . . whether increased public scrutiny might result in more officer deaths as people   the officers’   decisions. ” That sentiment  —   that merely scrutinizing police shootings will result in more officer deaths  —   is one commonly expressed by police unions and advocacy groups. Agree with it or not, it’s a strange view coming from the head of an agency entrusted to investigate police shootings fairly and objectively. Keel then told the paper, “as long as individuals continue to not follow the instructions of law enforcement   …     there’s going to continue to be these confrontations. The public has to understand to be more compliant. ” Melvin Tucker is former police chief in Tallahassee, Fla. and now works as a litigation consultant. He has consulted in over 500 cases, including 21 in South Carolina. He was a consultant for Phillips in the Ellis case. “To hear that from the head of SLED bothers me,” Tucker says. “It makes an assumption right off the bat that any shooting or incident of excessive force was the citizen’s fault, not the police officer’s. You have to question whether there’s any objectivity. ” Tucker and other policing experts interviewed for this series reviewed several cases, many previously unreported, and found a pattern of inaccurate statements, misleading reports and at times what appeared to them to be rather brazen attempts to cover up misconduct. The reviewers generally concluded that the SLED investigations into these cases were too deferential to the accused officers, incomplete and at times showed little interest in looking beyond the statements of police officers. As readers will see over the course of this series, the false statements and reports were often not just from individual officers, but occurred at an institutional level. “Practice here long enough, and you start to see patterns of deceit,” says Mills. “In some of these departments, there’s little hesitation about hiding or even manipulating evidence. ” SLED’s investigations generally don’t look into that, either. In short, while SLED meets the first of Stoughton’s criteria for credible outside investigations  —   the appearance of independence  —   there’s good evidence that it falls short on the second, actual independence, accuracy and objectivity. The Post and Courier investigation last year, for example, concluded that SLED’s handling of police shootings amounted to “an investigative system stacked in favor of officers who use their guns. ” In one example, the paper looked at the shooting of Bryant Heyward, a    black man in Hollywood, S. C. Heyward dialed 911 last May as his home was being invaded by two gunmen. Heyward quickly grabbed his handgun and exchanged fire with the men. When the police arrived, a deputy mistook Heyward for one of the assailants and shot him, paralyzing him. The discrepancy in how Heyward and the deputy were treated is telling. Heyward was interrogated by an officer who climbed into the ambulance with him on the way to the hospital. When the paper’s article ran nearly three weeks later, the deputy still hadn’t been questioned. Of the 235 SLED investigations of   shootings, the Post and Courier found 168 in which investigators documented the amount of time that had lapsed before the officers were asked to give a statement. Of those, 104 officers were given two or more days before talking to investigators. Only 35 were required to give a statement the same day. As Richard Harpootlian pointed out above, SLED typically assigns investigators by region  —   a SLED agent from the southern part of the state will usually get cases from that area. The theory is that those agents will have local knowledge of the area and local sources that could aid in their investigation. But Tucker explains that presents a lot of problems too. “How is an agency like SLED staffed?” Tucker asks. “With police officers. Where do those officers come from? Other police departments. The same police agencies that SLED investigates. I had a case where the SLED investigator had just worked as a deputy for the same department he was investigating. You can say an agency like that is independent, I guess. But I don’t know that it means much. ” The attorneys and experts interviewed for this series say while such a direct conflict of interest isn’t always the case, it also isn’t uncommon. The Post and Courier review also found that as in the Ellis case, SLED officers rarely looked into an officer’s disciplinary history or at other evidence to determine if the officer is reliable. Nor did the agency look into the history and patterns of particular police departments. Each case was typically looked at in isolation, with a great deal of weight and trust put on the officers’ statements. Phillips was so troubled by Ellis’s death that he brought it to the attention of South Carolina U. S. Attorney William Nettles. “He seemed disturbed by it, and said he’d look into it,” Phillips says. A couple months later, Phillips received a curt voice mail from the FBI agent assigned to investigate the case, telling him he’d found no evidence that the deputies had violated Ellis’s civil rights. Phillips later discovered that prior to joining the FBI, the same agent had been a deputy with the Kershaw County Sheriff’s Department. In the end, despite the $2 million settlement, neither Gregg Lowery, William Sowell or Tyrell Coleman was ever disciplined or reprimanded for the death of Lori Jean Ellis. “It’s bad here,” Phillips says. “There’s a culture of not just brutality, but invincibility. There’s no oversight. You see blatant lying, not just from individual officers, but from entire agencies. They think they can get away with anything. And they usually do. ” (Note: The Kershaw County Sheriff’s Department and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources did not respond to a request for an interview. A public information officer with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division initially agreed to set up an interview with chief Mark Keel, but then didn’t call back.) Coming in Part 2: The power of video."
"        LITTLE ROCK  —    A   door at the Big Country Chateau led   police officer Donna Lesher to Eugene Ellison. Lesher was moonlighting, patrolling the   apartment complex on foot with a partner, another   female officer. Lesher saw the door on the   of a spare,   building. The officers were immediately suspicious. Who would leave their door open on a cold December evening? The white officers climbed the stairs and saw Ellison, a    black man, sitting on his couch inside. In front of him was a coffee table, its glass top broken. Standing outside the apartment, they asked Ellison whether he was okay. Ellison said he was fine. The officers were not satisfied. Something still seemed odd to them. His shirt was unbuttoned, and he appeared to be shivering. They later said they thought that he might need help or that maybe a crime had been committed and someone else was in the apartment. When they continued to question him, he grew angry. “Get the     out of my house,” he said. Lesher’s partner, Detective Tabitha McCrillis, walked into the apartment and confronted him. What happened next is still in dispute. Ellison ended up dead on the floor of his apartment, two bullet holes in his chest. Donna Lesher said she fired only as a last resort after a furious fight with Ellison. More than five years later, the tragic death of Eugene Ellison still haunts Little Rock, splitting the city and its   police department along racial lines. It shows what can happen when police investigate their own in cases of fatal shootings and end up with results that leave little resolved in the minds of the public. Allegations of favoritism, collusion, conflicts of interest and special treatment have hovered over the case from the beginning, according to interviews, court records and previously undisclosed internal affairs files obtained by The Washington Post.    LEFT: Officer Donna Lesher is seen in a photo taken by a crime scene specialist after she fatally shot Eugene Ellison during a confrontation on the night of Dec. 9, 2010, in Apartment 213 at the Big Country Chateau in Little Rock. RIGHT: Detective Tabitha McCrillis, also photographed after the shooting, was involved in the deadly confrontation. Both officers were providing   security at the apartment complex that night to make extra money. (Little Rock Police Department)  The Little Rock investigators were in an impossible position from the start. Donna Lesher wasn’t just a Little Rock police officer. She was married to a Little Rock homicide sergeant, who happened to be the boss of the detectives assigned to investigate Lesher’s shooting case. Eugene Ellison wasn’t just some irritable old man living on Social Security and veteran’s benefits in a   area. He was the father of two men who had joined the Little Rock police force, one of them still serving as a ranking officer. The chief of police at the time, in charge of investigating Donna Lesher to the fullest, had years earlier recommended against hiring her when she was a police cadet, saying she was “a liability to the department because she is an unreliable employee,” according to an internal police memorandum. Three separate investigations of the 2010 confrontation came to the same conclusion: Lesher was justified in shooting Ellison because she feared for her life. The investigations failed to stop the questions. Eugene Ellison’s sons brought a federal civil rights lawsuit asserting that their father had been wrongfully killed. The case was supposed to go to trial Monday. A settlement was announced Friday, hours after this story was posted online. The city and the Big Country Chateau agreed to pay a total of $1. 4 million, and the city will issue an apology and erect a memorial bench, the sons’ attorney, Michael J. Laux, said.   [UPDATE: Little Rock settles lawsuit over 2010 police shooting]  In 2012, under oath, Donna Lesher gave the following account to Laux: “Couldn’t you have left in the middle of the fight?” “We could have,” Lesher said. “Why didn’t you?” “Because that’s not  —   I’m not going to just give up. ”   . sectionLimited .   . sectionLimited h2 span . sectionLimited p . sectionLimited .  . sectionLimited h2 . sectionLimited . :hover p.   @media ( :1200px) @media ( :979px) @media ( :767px) .   }  Fatal Force  0  people were shot and killed by police in 2016.  See the database   (function() )})()})();  Complicated racial equation Police shootings exploded into the national consciousness on Aug. 9, 2014, when an officer in Ferguson, Mo. confronted    Michael Brown after a reported robbery at a convenience store. A fight ensued, a couple of shots were fired, and Officer Darren Wilson pursued Brown and shot him several times. Brown’s body lay in the street for four hours as public outrage built, culminating in days of rioting. Wilson was eventually cleared after a grand jury investigation, the results of which were presented to the public in an extraordinary release of documents. Still, dissatisfaction persisted, triggering more unrest and further fueling the Black Lives Matter movement. Today, police shootings go under the instant microscope of cellphone cameras and social media. Every detail is dissected, and the public has demanded greater accountability. Most police departments conduct their own homicide investigations of   shootings. Some police experts and elected officials have been calling on departments to turn that task over to outside agencies to ensure objectivity and fairness. Last summer, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced that his state attorney general would investigate all fatal shootings of unarmed civilians in the state in the aftermath of the death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. Garner, 43, died July 17, 2014, after a confrontation with police during which an officer with the New York Police Department placed Garner in a chokehold. In thousands of fatal shootings since 2005, 68 officers have been charged with crimes, and 12 have been convicted, according to records compiled by The Washington Post and researchers at Bowling Green State University. Frustrated families often file civil lawsuits, with mixed results. A Post database tracked 990 fatal police shootings in 2015, which have so far resulted in 18 officers being charged.  Inside the Little Rock Police Department, some detectives thought an outside agency should have been summoned to investigate the Lesher shooting. “I don’t think that we are capable of actually investigating each other because we got too many friendships,” Terrell Vaughn, a black Little Rock homicide detective, told internal affairs investigators examining the Ellison shooting. “I’ve always felt that; that we should never [be] handling our shootings. ” Donna Lesher declined to discuss the shooting. “I’m not able to talk about the case,” she told The Post. “I don’t want to answer any questions. ” Her husband did not respond to requests for comment. Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner, who is black, declined through a spokesman to discuss the shooting, citing the pending civil trial. “We’re not going to talk about the case,” department spokesman Lt. Steven McClanahan said.  Little Rock City Attorney Thomas M. Carpenter, who is defending Lesher and McCrillis in the lawsuit brought by Ellison’s family, also declined to discuss the case beyond providing a limited statement. “As typical for deadly force situations, there were two investigations  —   a criminal investigation and an internal affairs investigation,” Carpenter wrote in an email. “Both of these were resolved against taking action against the involved officers. ” The Justice Department also conducted an investigation. Federal prosecutors concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove that Lesher acted “willfully” or “with a bad purpose to disregard the law”  —   the standard needed to bring criminal charges in a civil rights case. Last year, Carpenter discussed the case on camera with Little Rock television station KARK 4 News. He noted that the Big Country Chateau was a   area, and he said Lesher and McCrillis were simply doing their jobs that night when they entered Ellison’s apartment. “Let’s assume for a moment they didn’t do that; they saw the open door and they walked by and there was somebody in there who killed Mr. Ellison. What would people say about the police then?” Carpenter asked. “I think the answer is, when you see something out of the ordinary like that, you hope that the police will check on it. In this particular situation, with all the circumstances that existed, Mr. Ellison got agitated, a fight broke out, you can hear the fight on the tape, and it ended the way it ended. ” Carpenter also said the officers tried to persuade Ellison to surrender, backing up and ordering him to get on the ground. Instead, Carpenter said, Ellison refused and reached for his cane. “I think the main thing people have to remember is that you want your police officers to be the ones going into difficult situations when everybody else is running out,” he said. “They’ve got to hope they can get it under control without using deadly force, but they’ve got to know they can use deadly force if they can’t get it under control. ”    A view of downtown Little Rock, the most populous city in Arkansas, on March 6. On a December night more than five years ago, Eugene Ellison, 67, was fatally shot in his apartment by Donna Lesher, a Little Rock officer working   at the Big Country Chateau apartments. Ellison had two sons who had joined the Little Rock Police Department. One had retired from the force and other was serving when Ellison was killed. That son remains on the force. The officers involved in their father’s death were exonerated by an internal investigation, and the brothers filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the department. On Friday, the city of Little Rock agreed to settle the suit. The trial was to have begun Monday. (Whitney   Washington Post)  Little Rock sits along the Arkansas River and is the most populous city in the state, with more than 700, 000 residents in its metropolitan area. The community is almost equally split between whites and blacks: It is 49 percent white and 42 percent black. The police department is 64 percent white and 31 percent black. Between 1992 and 2014, Little Rock police fatally shot 22 people; 15 of them were black, according to internal police records.  In that period, one white officer was charged with shooting a    black male suspected of burglary. The    case resulted in two mistrials, and prosecutors declined to retry the officer. The Lesher case rests atop this complicated racial equation. Vaughn is one of several black homicide detectives involved in the Lesher case who in interviews with internal affairs investigators and lawyers questioned how the matter was handled. “That’s like having to investigate your boss’s wife,” Sgt. Jonathan C. White, another Little Rock homicide detective who is black, said in a sworn statement after the shooting. “It’s just an uncomfortable position all the way around to put everybody in an uncomfortable position. Not only myself. And that’s why I think that  —   to me that’s the very reason it should have went out of house immediately, so that we wouldn’t have been put in that position. ” Several other detectives on the case  —   about a dozen worked on it in total  —   said they were comfortable with how it was conducted. “Do you believe this department is capable of handling this investigation?” an internal affairs investigator asked Detective Tommy Hudson, who is white. “Quite well,” Hudson responded.      The anatomy of a fatal police shooting View Graphic     The anatomy of a fatal police shooting  The fatal confrontation By the time Donna Lesher spotted the open door to Ellison’s apartment on the night of Dec. 9, 2010, she had been a Little Rock police officer for 16 years. When a supervisor recommended against hiring Lesher, she was a    police cadet, a 1991 graduate of Central High School in Little Rock. She had wanted to be a police officer since kindergarten.  . Stuart Thomas wrote a memo citing criticism of Lesher’s failure to properly alphabetize police employee records. A   job took three days, he wrote, and a review found that “large sections of records had been randomly placed within the files,” which “suggests negligence and dereliction of duty. ” Still, she was retained as a police cadet. Two years later, Lesher joined the force as a sworn officer. During her first five years on the job, she was disciplined for crashing her patrol car and for other infractions, records show. Lesher also did not know how to use a telescoping baton, which officers often call their “stick. ” It is an important weapon, providing officers with a    option short of pulling out their pistols. While on the job, Lesher met her future husband. James Lesher had joined the department in 1986. Eighteen years later, he was promoted to sergeant and was put in charge of the homicide squad’s    operations, supervising seven detectives. James Lesher also held an   job helping to coordinate security at the Big Country Chateau on the outskirts of downtown Little Rock. It was a lucrative assignment for moonlighting officers, paying $30 an hour, and Lesher secured a spot for his wife. About 8 p. m. on Dec. 9, Donna Lesher, then 37, and her partner, Tabitha McCrillis, 27, spotted the open door to Apartment 213. McCrillis was in full uniform; Lesher was wearing a   with an image of a police badge on the front and the words “police” in block letters on the back. The following account comes from the four police officers at the scene, who later gave statements to internal affairs investigators and homicide detectives, and the lawyers who are now suing Lesher and McCrillis in federal court. Standing on the   walkway outside the   apartment, Lesher and McCrillis identified themselves as police officers. Lesher asked Ellison whether everything was okay.    A view of the Big Country Chateau apartments in March. The complex had a reputation as a   area, and Donna Lesher and Tabitha McCrillis were working there   on the night of Dec. 9, 2010, when they had an encounter with Eugene Ellison that left the    dead in his apartment with two bullets to the chest. (Whitney   Washington Post)  “What do you think’s wrong?” she recalled him responding. “He told us to leave. I’m like, ‘No.’ ” McCrillis stepped into the apartment. Ellison got up from the couch. McCrillis pushed Ellison back, and he struck McCrillis with his fist. She hit him with her baton. His glasses flew off his head. Ellison, who had myopic astigmatism, a form of nearsightedness, pulled the baton out of McCrillis’s hand. Lesher entered the apartment and joined the fight. She later said she feared Ellison would push her out of the apartment and over the railing of the   walkway.  Emergency backup was summoned by radio. “Send us some units; he’s got my stick,” McCrillis said. Lesher elbowed Ellison in the groin, bit him on the arm and   him. McCrillis left the apartment. Backup officers Vincent Lucio, who is Hispanic, and Brad Boyce, who is white, ran up the stairs to the apartment but did not enter. Lucio pulled Lesher out of the apartment onto the   walkway, which was 4 feet, 2. 5 inches wide. All four officers were now on the walkway outside the apartment. Microphones worn by the   male officers captured the chaos as all four officers shouted at Ellison, who was still inside his apartment. “Get on the ground,” Lesher ordered Ellison. “I ain’t getting on no . . .” Ellison said. “You getting on the ground,” Boyce said. “I’m going to tell you one time to get on the ground,” Lucio said as he ordered his colleagues to “move back, move back. ” “He’s getting his cane,” McCrillis said. Ellison lifted the cane over his head like a “baseball bat,” Lesher later said. The officers were all outside the apartment bunched up on the walkway. Lesher drew her weapon. McCrillis said she already had unholstered hers. “I’m fixing to shoot him,” Lesher said. “Donna?” McCrillis said. “You better put it down,” Lesher said. She fired the first shot with her .  Glock handgun less than a second later. “Put it down,” she said as she fired again, less than a second later. Ellison fell to the floor. “  ” McCrillis said. “Donna?” “You’re not going to come at us with no weapon,” Lesher said. “You okay?” McCrillis asked. “Yeah, I’m good,” Lesher said. “Call my husband, please. ”     The open door of Eugene Ellison’s apartment is seen after the shooting on Dec. 9, 2010. (Little Rock Police Department Crime Scene Specialist Unit)     Officers testified in an internal affairs investigation that Eugene Ellison attacked them with this cane. (Little Rock Police Department Crime Scene Specialist Unit)    After the shooting Minutes after the shooting, as Lesher and McCrillis waited outside the Big Country Chateau, other police officers as well as medical teams descended on the scene. A dashboard camera in one of the patrol cars showed that Lesher and McCrillis remained together at the scene for nearly 15 minutes, although Little Rock department general orders require that any officers involved be separated as soon as the scene is secured after   shootings. The policy is designed to prevent officers from coordinating their stories about what happened. Lt. Glenn King, a black officer who was James Lesher’s boss in the homicide division at the time, heard the frantic radio traffic about a shooting at the Big Country Chateau and called James Lesher. King knew Donna Lesher worked the security detail there. “You might need to call and check on your wife,” King told his homicide sergeant. A few minutes later, James Lesher received a call from his wife. “She told me she was involved in an   shooting, that she was okay,” James Lesher later said. King told Lesher to go and see his wife. He said another homicide detective, Sgt. Mike Durham, would handle the investigation. “We took extra care to keep James out it,” Durham later said in an internal affairs statement. “He never got involved in any, any kind of decision making, any interviews. ” Another dashboard camera recorded James Lesher as he arrived on the scene in his personal vehicle. Six minutes later, he drove away with his wife. In many police departments, officers involved in shootings are permitted to have what are called “companion officers. ” Usually, they are colleagues on the force assigned to console the shooters, contact family members and to try to determine whether the officers need medical or psychological help. On the night of the shooting, James Lesher served as his wife’s companion officer. He drove her back to the Little Rock police headquarters and they stayed in his office in the homicide division. They were joined by a   lawyer. King said Little Rock general orders do not address whether spouses can serve as companion officers. “The officer gets to pick his or her companion partner,” King recently told The Post. “And I think that some were disappointed that the sergeant and his wife, you know, that she used him as a companion. I don’t have a problem with it. That’s who she was comfortable with. He had been removed from the investigation. To me that was their business. I had other things to worry about. ” At some point that night, a city prosecutor advised James Lesher against remaining as his wife’s companion officer. “He wasn’t sure that it would look very good, and of course I agreed,” James Lesher said later in a statement. “I was like, ‘Yeah, you’re probably right,’ and I went ahead and backed out of the whole situation and they called her another, actually I called her another companion officer to take that place. ”  A little more than four hours after the shooting, homicide detectives interviewed Donna Lesher. Interviews in the detective division are frequently   allowing other investigators assigned to the case to watch. As soon as the detectives began to interview Lesher, she broke down. Homicide supervisors turned off the video feed. When the interview resumed, the video feed remained off. Detectives in charge of the case said they cut the feed because they were concerned that too many people were in the detective division at the time. “I was told that there was people watching that and that there  —   you know, you could hear some of the conversations going on and I thought that was inappropriate so I made the decision to turn it off,” Hudson, the homicide detective, told internal affairs. White, the Little Rock detective, said he believed some homicide detectives were protecting their boss’s wife by cutting the feed of her interview. “I guess we do things differently, huh?” White would later say, according to internal affairs files.    The headquarters of the Little Rock Police Department, seen on March 8. Donna Lesher, the white officer who fatally shot a    black man in his apartment on Dec. 9, 2010, had killed the father of one of her colleagues on the force, and the shooting was investigated by detectives normally under the supervision of her husband, Sgt. James Lesher. The department said James Lesher had no role in the investigation that exonerated his wife in the shooting. (Whitney   Washington Post)  Portrayal angers family The day after the shooting, the Little Rock Police Department held a news conference.   Lt. Terry Hastings recounted that Lesher and McCrillis had been working   at the Big Country Chateau. “The goal was to see if he needed help,” Hastings said of Ellison. “They never got that chance. He attacked them immediately. ” Hastings also said that Ellison picked up a “heavy wooden walking cane and started advancing on Officer Lesher, swinging it. She told him several times, according to witnesses, to put the cane down. He did not. At that time she fired two rounds, striking him. ” According to the conversations recorded by the microphones, Lesher ordered Ellison to “put it down” less than a second before she fired.  Hastings released other information at the news conference. The police had obtained Ellison’s court and   records. “Mr. Ellison does have emotional problems, and he had been treated for such in the past,” he said. “We’re not sure why he advanced on our officers and attacked them. We are working with family and other members to try to get a clear answer to why he may have done that. ” Ellison’s family was stunned. The man Lesher shot was the father of former Little Rock Detective Spencer Ellison and current Little Rock Lt. Troy Ellison, a past president of the Black Officers Association. They said no one in authority at the department had contacted them prior to the news conference. “Nobody from the police department, the chaplain didn’t call, no supervisor, the chief, nobody called,” Spencer Ellison said in a recent interview. “I felt betrayed. I felt like a   citizen. All the years that I have given my life and worked for the police department, I would think if anything, they would do right by their own. ” Troy and Spencer Ellison also were infuriated by the personal information released at the news conference. The brothers said their father, a Vietnam veteran who had served in the Navy, had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia in 1983, more than two decades before the shooting. Back then, he had been arrested and acquitted on assault charges. Since that time, he had been taking medication and had not had problems with police. Ellison had lived at the Big Country Chateau for nearly 13 years. Some of Little Rock’s black officers were upset that the department had portrayed Ellison as a disturbed man who could not be controlled without the use of deadly force. “We made this person out to be a monster from jump street, from jump street, without having all the facts,” White, the homicide detective, would later say in an internal affairs statement. “We went from zero to a hundred and fifty in a matter of seconds. ”    Spencer Ellison, left, a former Little Rock police detective, and his brother, current Little Rock police Lt. Troy Ellison, at Troy’s home in the city on March 7. The brothers sued Officer Donna Lesher and Detective Tabitha McCrillis, alleging that the pair violated the civil rights of their father, Eugene Ellison, whom Lesher fatally shot on Dec. 9, 2010. (Whitney   Washington Post)  The internal investigation With questions swirling around the case,   Chief Stuart Thomas, who had recommended against the hiring of Donna Lesher 18 years earlier, asked the Arkansas State Police to conduct an independent investigation of the shooting, out of an “abundance of caution. ” By then, five days had passed. The first 24 hours of a homicide investigation are considered to be critical. The director of the State Police and his criminal investigations commander called Thomas, and they all agreed that too much time had passed. “An investigation by State Police could be compromised by an investigation that’s already underway by Little Rock Police and we didn’t think we could do a fair investigation since we weren’t there to begin with,” the State Police said in a statement issued at the time. Thomas told the Arkansas   at the time that he remained confident his department could conduct a credible investigation. “I hope that people are comfortable that we are trying to do the best we can with a very complicated and very delicate investigation,” Thomas said. Shortly after the shooting, the Little Rock Police Department opened an internal affairs investigation to determine whether the shooting was justified and whether any department regulations had been broken. On Dec. 20, 2010, internal affairs Detective Stephanie Berthia questioned James Lesher about the night of the shooting. In a   interview, she asked him how he found out about the shooting and what he did in the aftermath. Berthia asked Lesher whether he had played any role in the investigation of his wife. He said he had not. Nine days later, Berthia interviewed Donna Lesher for 71 minutes. Lesher said Ellison got off his couch, moved toward McCrillis and began hitting her. McCrillis pulled out her baton. She fell to the ground as Ellison hit her in the head. Lesher said that she   Ellison but that this was ineffective. She said she, too, ended up on the ground fighting with Ellison. Lesher said she thought Ellison was    and about 275 pounds, while she was    and 156, and McCrillis was    and 120. The medical examiner’s report would later show that Ellison was    weighing 214 pounds.    Eugene Ellison, right, shares time with friends in this undated image. Ellison was fatally shot in his home on Dec. 9, 2010, by a Little Rock police officer. The trial of a wrongful death lawsuit brought by his sons was to have begun Monday, but the city of Little Rock announced a settlement of the suit Friday. (Courtesy of the Ellison family)  At one point, Lesher said, Ellison had his arm around her neck. Berthia asked Lesher whether she feared for her life. “Yes, I  —   I was scared that he was fixing to kill us,” she said. Lesher said that near the end of the fight, she had separated herself from Ellison and was standing outside the apartment with McCrillis, Lucio and Boyce. Lesher said Ellison was eight to 10 feet away, approaching quickly with his cane over his head, when she fired. Ellison was still inside the apartment.      Internal affairs detectives also interviewed McCrillis, Lucio and Boyce. “I was scared that we  —   you know we were fighting for our life,” McCrillis said. “At what point do you think you were fighting for your life?” an internal affairs investigator asked. “When I was on the ground,” McCrillis said. McCrillis said she got up and left the apartment as Ellison returned to the couch to retrieve his cane. She said she was standing behind Lesher and could not see whether Ellison was swinging his cane. Lucio said that before Lesher fired, he told Ellison, “Why don’t you just calm down?” according to his internal affairs statement. Lucio said Ellison was in a “boxer stance” and responded: “I’m not calming down. I’m fighting everybody. ” Lucio said he heard Lesher tell Ellison to drop his cane before she fired into the apartment. He told investigators that he could not see Ellison because he was behind Lesher. Boyce, a rookie officer on probation, said that Ellison was repeatedly told to “drop the weapon” and that he saw Ellison swinging his cane a few times. He said he, too, had unholstered his gun. Berthia also interviewed White, one of the homicide detectives working on the case. He said he thought the department would not hold Donna Lesher accountable. “They needed to address some things as far as the investigation was concerned,” White said in a statement to internal affairs. “And what is that?” Berthia asked. “We have put ourself in a situation where we might have to charge an officer,” he said. “Okay,” Berthia said. “That’s something that probably won’t happen,” White said. Laux, the attorney for Ellison’s sons, criticized the internal affairs investigation as failing to press the Leshers on key points. He said Berthia did not ask the couple what time they left the scene together, what time they arrived at police headquarters or when they were separated. She also did not ask them whether they discussed the case before Donna Lesher’s interview with the homicide detectives for whom James Lesher was supervisor, a transcript of the interview shows. “We still don’t know where the couple went, what they did, what they discussed or with who they talked,” Laux said. Berthia declined to comment. “I choose not to talk about it,” she said.  On May 9, 2011, five months after the shooting, the Pulaski County office of the prosecuting attorney announced that it would not file criminal charges. On the basis of the investigation conducted by Little Rock’s homicide division, prosecutors concluded that the shooting was justified. Ellison “armed himself with a cane and accosted the officers with it in a threatening manner,” prosecutors wrote in their decision. “When he refused to put this weapon down, Officer Lesher, being unable to subdue him in a   manner, shot him twice. ”    A photograph of Eugene Ellison’s apartment shows the couch on which he was sitting when Officer Donna Lesher and Detective Tabitha McCrillis approached his open apartment door at the Big Country Chateau on the night of Dec. 9, 2010. From the doorway, the officers asked Ellison whether he was okay, and he said he was. They lingered, and he grew agitated and aggressively asked them to leave. Instead, they entered the apartment, and a fatal confrontation ensued. (Little Rock Police Department’s Crime Scene Specialist Unit)  Exonerations and a lawsuit  Two months after the decision not to file criminal charges, Thomas, the police chief, accepted the findings of his department’s internal affairs division exonerating Lesher and McCrillis. Their only infraction: neglecting to notify the department that they had planned to work   at the Big Country Chateau the night of the shooting. On Oct. 17, 2011, Spencer Ellison announced that the family was filing a wrongful death lawsuit. “I want the city of Little Rock and the nation as a whole to know that his death was senseless and that a vital chapter of our lives was taken forever,” he said that day. Since then, Laux has been taking sworn statements in preparation for the trial. In one of those statements, Laux asked Donna Lesher whether she could have left Ellison’s apartment without shooting him. “Certainly in the second before you shot Mr. Ellison you could have  —   you could have walked away. Correct?” “Yes,” Lesher said. Laux also questioned Lucio, one of the backup officers. “I did not fear him,” Lucio said. “You did not have a fear of deadly force from Mr. Ellison when you got there, did you?” Laux asked. “No, I did not. ” Thomas, the police chief at the time, acknowledged that mistakes were made during the investigation. He said in a deposition that the officers should have been separated after the shooting. He also said that James Lesher, “from a professional standpoint,” should have stayed away from the scene and that cutting the video feed of Donna Lesher’s interview “wasn’t the best decision. ” Still, he stood by his officers. “Was the shooting of Mr. Ellison by Donna Lesher unavoidable in your eyes?” Laux asked Thomas. “Yes, sir. ” “She had no other option but to shoot him?” “From her perspective and given the situation, I believe that her use of deadly force at that particular time was appropriate,” Thomas said. Carpenter, the city attorney, tried to persuade a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. U. S. District Judge Brian S. Miller declined to do so, ruling that Ellison repeatedly asked Lesher and McCrillis to leave his apartment, that they kept striking him, and that at some point during the altercation, they knocked his glasses off. “[Lesher] did not announce to Ellison, whose glasses had been knocked off, that she had a gun and was going to shoot if he did not put his cane down,” the judge wrote in his ruling. Miller dismissed the city’s suggestion that Ellison’s history of   problems may have factored into the shooting. “This was not known to any of the officers; therefore, his history was not part of the totality of the circumstances that confronted the officers on December 9, 2010, when Ellison was killed,” he wrote. “A reasonable jury could find that Lesher used deadly force against a person who did not pose an immediate threat of serious physical injury or death to them. ” Carpenter appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. In January, the court declined to hear the case, clearing the way for the civil trial to proceed.  In March, Glenn King met with The Post. The former homicide division lieutenant had retired from the force a week earlier after a   career. He had hired Spencer and Troy Ellison onto the Little Rock force. He also was James Lesher’s boss the night that Eugene Ellison was killed. King said he was saddened by what happened to the Ellisons’ father at the hands of a fellow officer. He said that the investigation was handled properly, but a doubt lingers. “I will say that I think at some point when somebody tells you that, ‘Hey, I’m okay, leave,’ and if you don’t have a really, really, really good reason for that, maybe you should leave,” he said.    An investigation of the shooting death of    Eugene Ellison at the hands of a Little Rock police officer left his sons, including Little Rock police Lt. Troy Ellison, embittered, and with little resolved in the minds of the public. Troy Ellison was photographed at his father’s grave March 7.

"    CITY | This is the first installment in a series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia.       The woman was sitting on her sofa, working on her laptop, when she saw him. A young man, 6 feet 5 inches tall, wearing fuzzy knit gloves and gray denim pants. Standing inside her condominium in Hill East near the   Metro station. It was Oct. 13, in broad daylight, a little after 2 p. m. At first, she thought he was lost. But then he grabbed her and slammed her against the wall. She punched and kicked, but he dragged her across the hardwood floor and into the bedroom. And he raped her, according to charges filed in D. C. Superior Court. “Stop fighting, or I’ll kill you,” he said. The    woman, described in court papers as 5 feet tall and 100 pounds, suffered fractures in her eye socket and cheekbone. The alleged perpetrator,    Antwon Durrell Pitt, had an extensive criminal history, including eight arrests in four years and a robbery conviction. Three times, he was sentenced under laws designed to promote leniency and second chances for inexperienced adult offenders. In two of those cases, he was sentenced under the District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act, a   law aimed at “deserving” offenders under the age of 22. Pitt’s case shows that such laws, combined with lax enforcement by key federal agencies, can give many chances to violent offenders despite repeated criminal behavior and the failure to abide by terms of release, according to a Washington Post review of court records, transcripts and probation reports. The D. C. criminal justice system relies on a mix of federal agencies and D. C. judges to swiftly intervene and communicate vital information to protect the public from violent offenders. In the crucial weeks before the rape, a D. C. Superior Court magistrate judge and two federal agencies  —   the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) and the U. S. Parole Commission  —   failed to work together to take Pitt off the streets. Pitt’s behavior raised many red flags, indicating escalating risk. Just out of prison last summer after serving a robbery sentence, Pitt did not report for some of his   drug testing and anger management sessions. He did not keep in contact with his supervision officer. And in a final act of defiance, Pitt cut off the GPS monitoring bracelet affixed to his ankle and let the battery run dead. He was completely off the grid. CSOSA, the federal agency charged with watching D. C. offenders released from prison, did not request a warrant for Pitt’s arrest for 15 days after losing contact with him. The Parole Commission waited a week after getting that request before forwarding it to law enforcement. And the magistrate judge denied a prosecutor’s request to keep Pitt behind bars, despite a troubling report from the Pretrial Services Agency. “No conditions or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance or safety to the community,” said the report that was given to magistrate William Nooter.  The District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act was passed in 1985 to give youthful adult offenders a chance to have their records wiped clean from public view if they successfully complete their sentences, even those who commit violent crimes, with the exception of murder and a second crime of violence while armed.   [Audit finds lax controls at agency for troubled youth]  At a time when the Obama administration and Congress are working to ease “mandatory minimum” sentencing guidelines for   offenses, in part because of concerns that such laws have unjustly imprisoned large numbers of African Americans, D. C. law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about the number of repeat violent offenders on the streets. The District, for example, has seen a near doubling in the percentage of homicide suspects with prior   arrests. “Sometimes, we just scratch our heads,” D. C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said. “We feel like there’s a revolving door for violent offenders. It’s very frustrating for us because we see the victim, and we see the impact on the victim. ” Pitt’s case is among at least 3, 600 under the Youth Act since 2007 that have not been scrubbed from court records, according to Post research. Of those, 1, 900 were felonies, including more than 700 for violent crimes. CSOSA spokesman Leonard A. Sipes Jr. said the agency followed its policies and procedures in the Pitt case. “Mr. Pitt was assessed, closely supervised, referred for appropriate services and placed on GPS,” Sipes said. Nooter, now a Superior Court judge, and two other Superior Court judges involved in Pitt’s cases declined to comment for this story, as did two of Pitt’s supervision officers, citing privacy rules. James E. Bacchus, the chief of staff for the Parole Commission, said that the agency can in some cases prioritize certain warrants.  “The criminal activity in this case didn’t rise to the level that would have us redivert our work routine,” Bacchus said. Pitt is set to go on trial Monday on a charge of   sexual abuse, along with charges of robbery, burglary and kidnapping related to the alleged October attack.  “Mr. Pitt is about to stand trial for crimes he did not commit,” said his attorney, Judith Pipe of the Public Defender Service, in a written statement. “His DNA wasn’t on the victim, wasn’t on her sheets, and wasn’t in her apartment, and the victim doesn’t identify him as her assailant. We are confident that a fair trial  —   a trial based on the evidence and not on unrelated past acts and allegations  —   will show that Mr. Pitt did not commit these crimes. ” A prosecutor recently said in court that the victim’s DNA was found on Pitt’s glove. The U. S. attorney’s office declined to comment for this story. In Hill East, the rape devastated a   block of neighbors on A Street SE. Hundreds of frightened residents attended a community meeting in October.  “I want to know why he was out. He has a violent background. He has clearly targeted women in the past,” said Denise Krepp, an advisory neighborhood commissioner who lives half a block from the scene of the crime. “So who made the decision that he should be out on the streets? “And I want a name. Because someone is responsible for this. ”    LEFT: Pitt, then 17 years old, is pictured in a mug shot from 2011, when he was arrested and charged with battery and aggravated assault for slamming a chair against a boy’s head in a   treatment facility in Georgia. RIGHT: Pitt, now 21, is shown in his most recent mug shot from an arrest in Prince George’s County in October 2015. According to court documents, members of a task force approached Pitt outside a gas station after they had traced a stolen cellphone from a woman allegedly raped by Pitt. (Cobb County Sheriff’s   George’s County State’s Attorney’s Office)  A troubled youth Antwon Pitt was born in the District on June 1, 1994, and grew up the oldest of three children. His biological father was not involved in his life, according to court records. At age 12, Pitt was removed from his mother’s home and placed into the   system. He began psychiatric treatment at age 13. “They thought I needed somebody to talk to cause my mom was drinking,” he told a forensic psychologist, according to court records. “They thought I was affected by the drinking. ” Pitt worked at a recreation center and a movie theater when he was a teenager. The Post unsuccessfully attempted to reach several family members, and the available information about him is limited to what can be gleaned from police, court and probation records.  At 17, Pitt left Washington to enter treatment at Devereux, a   facility in Cobb County, Ga. that specializes in the care of emotionally troubled young adults. Pitt told the psychologist that he moved there because his social worker thought it “was the best thing for me at the time. ” The Post was unable to determine whether Pitt had a juvenile record, which would have been closed to public view. But he “had a long history of violent behavior” prior to his treatment in Georgia, according to comments from the facility’s program manager in court records.  [Timeline: Eight arrests, three convictions, three sentences under leniency laws]  On Oct, 28, 2011, within a few weeks after Pitt’s arrival in Georgia, a boy named DeAngelo, also 17, stepped in front of Pitt while they waited in line for medications. Pitt reacted by calling DeAngelo names, according to a police report. Later in the evening, according to the police report, Pitt picked up a metal chair and slammed it against the back of DeAngelo’s head. DeAngelo was taken to Kennestone Hospital, where he received 11 staples. A police officer asked Pitt why he did it. “I thought it was a good idea,” Pitt told him. A Cobb County grand jury indicted Pitt as an adult on charges of aggravated assault and battery. Later, a judge ordered Pitt examined for mental competency. The psychologist wrote that Pitt had   intelligence and did not understand what medications he was taking. “While Pitt may suffer from a mental illness,” she wrote, there was no indication that he did not understand the difference between right and wrong. After a plea deal in October 2012, a judge sentenced Pitt to one year in jail, with credit for the nearly 12 months he had already served. He was sentenced under Georgia’s First Offender law, which unlike D. C.’s Youth Act can be applied only to individuals who have not been previously convicted of felony crimes. Under the law, Pitt would have no conviction on his record unless a judge revoked the sentence. Within days of his Oct. 10, 2012, release from the Georgia jail, he was in trouble again. Crimes in D. C. After his return from Georgia, Pitt, now 18, moved into a group home on E Street SE. He commuted daily to attend Youth in Transition, an alternative school based in Baltimore. Within a   span, he was arrested five times. The first arrest occurred just two weeks after his release from jail in Georgia. On Oct. 24, a security guard at a Macy’s department store on G Street NW spotted Pitt stuffing five shirts into his pants and jacket sleeves. He was charged with shoplifting. After an appearance in court on Nov. 8, he was released upon signing a promise to return to court for his next hearing. Pitt failed to show up for the hearing, and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. On Dec. 22, he was arrested for the second time in two months and charged with a violation of the Bail Reform Act, a law that lays out criminal penalties for violating terms of release. This time he was held in jail for 16 days, unable to pay the $1, 000 bond set for his shoplifting case and the $500 bond in the bail case. On Jan. 7, 2013, he pleaded guilty to the bail charge, and the shoplifting charge was dropped. He was sentenced that day by Judge Juliet McKenna. Pitt’s social worker, Leslie Palmer, told the judge about his background, including his child neglect case beginning when he was 12 in 2006 and his stay at the Georgia facility. “I’ve probably been the only person that he’s had . . . consistent . . . in his treatment,” Palmer said. “But as he’s getting older, our relationship isn’t as close as it used to be. ” McKenna sentenced Pitt to six months of probation under D. C.’s Youth Act. In Pitt’s case, the law would allow him to avoid the statutory minimum   sentence for the Bail Reform Act violation.  [From the archives: D. C. considers law to protect youth offenders]  McKenna declined to comment for this story. The judge warned Pitt that if he violated his probation “then I’m kind of stuck with having to give you a   sentence. So the 16 days that you’ve done already at the jail are going to seem like nothing in comparison to the time you’ll be serving if you’re not successful on probation. ” Pitt told her that he understood. Signs of trouble appeared eight days later. On Jan. 15, Pitt’s CSOSA probation officer, LaTonya Clement, went to look for him at his group home on E Street SE. She learned that Pitt had been “officially ‘put out’ ” of the home four days earlier. He had allegedly assaulted another resident and two staff members, according to Clement’s report. No criminal charges were apparently filed over the alleged attack. From E Street, Pitt had moved into a group home on Kansas Avenue NW. Soon someone called police and reported that he was pacing back and forth with a knife, threatening to “kill everyone in this house,” according to police records. “I’ll smoke the police,” he told other residents. “I don’t give a damn. ” He stated that he needed the knife for protection in case anyone “gets in his face,” according to two witnesses. That day, Jan. 29, 2013, he was arrested for the third time in three months and charged with making threats. He was promptly released pending future proceedings on his personal promise that he would return to court. At this point, with battery, aggravated assault and threats in his background, Pitt’s propensity for violent behavior was becoming unmistakable.       âI just donât want to go to jailâ Pitt’s probation officer did not learn of his   until Feb. 7, records show. Concerned about the turn of events, Clement filed her report the next day and requested a hearing in D. C. Superior Court to determine whether he had violated his probation. A hearing was eventually scheduled for Feb. 26. Clement documented Pitt’s ejection from the E Street group home and said his whereabouts were “unknown at the writing of this violation report. ” Pitt posed a “high risk for community supervision” because of his “history of assaultive behavior,” his antisocial peers and environments, lack of employment, lack of discipline, and his maturity level, she wrote. A few days after Clement’s report, Feb. 11, Pitt was arrested for the fourth time in   months. This time, he was caught trying to go through the emergency gate at the Benning Road Metro station without paying his fare. A police officer noticed that he had a folding knife in the pocket of his pants and attempted to remove it. “    no,” Pitt told the officer. “You not taking my knife. ” After a struggle on the ground, the officer handcuffed Pitt. The officer found a second weapon, a       knife, in the left pocket of Pitt’s coat. He was charged with possession of a prohibited weapon. He was held in jail for 15 days, until his Feb. 26 hearing. After the hearing, he was released into the community under the additional supervision of a “specialized supervision unit” of the Pretrial Services Agency, which is responsible for gathering information about newly arrested defendants and preparing recommendations for release options. The agency attempted to connect Pitt with   services, and a judge scheduled a   status hearing for him. His probation hearings were deferred for the mental evaluation. Once again, Pitt was free on his personal recognizance, his promise to appear in court. The next month, on March 20, Pitt was arrested for the fifth time in five months and charged with destruction of property for breaking a bedroom door at the Kansas Avenue group home. Five days later, he was found to be “not in full compliance with release conditions, mental health services, and drug testing,” according to the court docket. In late May, Pitt appeared before McKenna to determine whether his probation would be revoked. Clement, Pitt’s probation officer, stated that Pitt had missed a number of drug tests and office visits. “You used to call in the beginning,” Clement told Pitt in court. “And he would even say, ‘I’m coming,’ but still never show up. ” Clement, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this story.  McKenna stated Pitt had not shown “any compliance” with his probation or with his   requirements. The judge also said that since February, Pitt’s probation officer had consistently requested that his probation be revoked. Pitt’s defense attorney, Robert Athanas, asked that Pitt be sentenced to the time he already served and still receive the benefit of the Youth Act. “With all due respect, Mr. Athanas, I think based on Mr. Pitt’s consistent pattern of behavior here, I don’t see that he remains eligible for treatment under the Youth Act,” McKenna stated. “There’s simply no indication here that Mr. Pitt is amenable to rehabilitation. ” The judge stated that she would sentence Pitt to 90 days, the statutory minimum for the Bail Reform Act, and he would get credit for the days he had already spent in jail. Pitt’s defense attorney asked for that time to be served in a halfway house, so that Pitt could continue to go to school and to receive treatment. The judge denied that request, saying that Hillcrest, a behavioral health program, was “unwilling” to continue to treat Pitt because of his behavior.  [D. C. fails to meet federal targets for helping jobless youths]  The defense attorney tried again, this time asking for the judge to   him to probation. “No,” she said. “Not at this time. Not given the history here. ” Pitt spoke up. “I’ll plead to anything,” he told her. “I just don’t want to go to jail. ” She told Pitt to step back to the U. S. Marshals, who took him into custody. The hearing was over. In June, Pitt pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor weapon charge in exchange for dismissal of his other criminal cases involving the threats and the destruction of property. He received another   sentence, to be served at the same time as his other one for the bail violation. On July 26, 2013, he was released from jail. His freedom would last for four days. âBut heâs violentâ Just before 2 a. m. on July 30, 2013, a    woman was on her doorstep entering her home on Ridge Street NW. A man approached, grabbed her and threw her down. He took her purse and fled. A D. C. police officer soon spotted a suspect  —   later identified as Pitt  —   who matched the description of the assailant. The suspect ran, and two other officers joined in pursuit. After one of the officers pulled the suspect to the ground, the man dropped a dark,    . Inside was a BB gun. The suspect reached for the gun, and an officer struck him in the face, according to the police report. He then bit another officer’s forearm. The officers recovered the victim’s black Samsung cellphone and the   which had been in her purse. Pitt was charged with robbery while armed and assault on a police officer while armed. “I just bought that gun today,” he volunteered, according to the report. “I’ve been carrying it all day. It’s not illegal. ” In the fall of 2013, Pitt pleaded guilty to one count of robbery, a felony, and one count of assault on a police officer, a misdemeanor.  Pitt’s   attorney asked for the statutory minimum for robbery, 24 months, with all but six months suspended. He also asked for sentencing under the Youth Act.  The prosecutor in the case, Marvin Lett, opposed the Youth Act sentencing. He argued that Pitt had already received leniency in Georgia for his “first offender” sentence and had failed the terms of his first Youth Act conviction in the District. By this point, Pitt had been arrested seven times and convicted three times, Lett wrote. “Quite simply, the defendant has exhausted his second chances,” he wrote. Pitt was also subject to a   report by CSOSA, which involves an assessment of the defendant’s criminal and family history. Such reports are not released to the public. But details from the report are included in Lett’s filings to the judge. They reveal, for the first time in public records, concerns about sexual behavior regarding Pitt. Lett revealed that the report documented “fabrications, deceptions and sexually inappropriate conduct,” including an incident in which Pitt had exposed himself to a jailhouse nurse on Aug. 8, 2013. The report said both Pitt’s mother and his social worker said he needed to receive treatment for “sexual misconduct,” according to Lett. Additionally, according to Pitt’s social worker, his “homicidal thoughts increased” after he was released from jail in Georgia in 2012, Lett said.  [Is throwing children in prison a bad idea?]  “The fact that Mr. Pitt is so young and has had such a troubled childhood is more than unfortunate,” the prosecutor wrote. “But it should not entirely protect him from the    of his own bad and violent decisions. . . . The government is concerned with releasing so quickly back into the community a defendant who continues to show ‘defiance, aggression and violent and sexual tendencies.’ ” Lett recommended a total of 36 months in prison. During a sentencing hearing on Dec. 3, 2013, Pitt’s attorney said his client was a young man who still had the chance to turn his life around. “Your honor, he’s consistently communicated to his  —   his younger family members that they should not make the same mistakes that he has,” his attorney said. D. C. Superior Court Judge Heidi Pasichow asked Pitt why he committed the robbery. “I wasn’t really thinking, your honor,” he said. Pasichow said she understood that Pitt was young. But she struggled with the severity of his crimes. “I mean it might be bad enough if we were talking about just simply a shoplifting or just simply a car theft, but we’re talking about a battery and we’re talking about an aggravated assault and we’re talking about possession of a prohibited weapon, a knife, and in this case we’re talking about coming up from behind someone in the early morning hours and I’m sure scaring  —   scaring this person. And then apparently wrestling around with an officer,” she said in court. “So I think the circumstances are dangerous, and the problem with that is as you said, you haven’t really given me any good explanation as to why you would do something like that other than you weren’t thinking. ” Pasichow sentenced Pitt to the statutory minimum  —   24 months  —   to be served in prison. Then she considered whether he would receive the benefit of the Youth Act to allow his record to be cleared of the robbery charge if he successfully completed his supervised release.  Pitt’s defense attorney argued that he would be an ideal candidate because he was a young man who did not use drugs or alcohol. The judge was still hesitant. “Right, but he’s violent,” the judge said. “It’s not clear to me that he understands exactly what he’s done. He’s had no explanation for it, no thought about it and I don’t know. ” Ultimately, Pasichow decided to sentence Pitt under the Youth Act. “It’s a very difficult decision,” the judge said. “I’m concerned about Mr. Pitt. I’m going to give him the benefit of the Youth Act sentence, but we’ll see. ” She ordered a list of conditions for Pitt after his release from prison, including:   treatment, sexual therapy and instructions to find a job or further his education. “Good luck, Mr. Pitt,” she told him. Pasichow declined to comment for this article through a court spokeswoman.    Denise Krepp stands in an alley off of A Street SE in the D. C. neighborhood of Hill East.

Pitt was released from a   federal prison close to Orlando, the Coleman II facility, which houses the notorious Boston mobster Whitey Bulger. Pitt had spent more than 19 months in prison and earned 126 days for time spent in jail in the District, according to Bureau of Prison records. He was now 21 years old. Under the terms of his release, he would be monitored for three years  —   until July 2018  —   by CSOSA. After he returned to Washington, he was fitted on Aug. 6 with a GPS bracelet. As an offender under “intensive” supervision requirements, Pitt would be required to have at least eight contacts a month with CSOSA. His supervision officer, George Eatmon, last had contact with Pitt on Sept. 18, court records show. Pitt also had missed      appointments and    sessions. Eatmon, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this story. Sipes, the spokesman for CSOSA, said that Eatmon followed agency policy by trying to bring Pitt back into compliance: On Sept. 21, Pitt reported to CSOSA and had contact with someone there, but not with Eatmon, the agency said. After that, there was no contact. The next day, Eatmon tried to visit Pitt at home but could not find him.  On Sept. 28, Pitt did not appear for a scheduled appointment. That day, CSOSA received a “master tamper alert”  —   indicating that Pitt had cut off his GPS bracelet and removed it from his ankle. His phone was disconnected as well. On Sept. 29, the agency learned the GPS battery had died. But Pitt would be back within the grasp of law enforcement within a day. About 5:30 p. m. on Sept. 30, a Wednesday night, Pitt was found by a D. C. police officer in a restroom stall on the third floor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in downtown Washington. He had a substance that appeared to be synthetic marijuana, along with a digital scale and small plastic bags. In his backpack, Pitt carried his GPS bracelet, the police report said. Pitt was arrested on three charges: unlawful possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance of synthetic cannabinoid, possession of drug paraphernalia and tampering with a GPS device. Two days later, Pitt was taken from his jail cell to appear in court for a formal reading of the drug charge against him. Pitt was in a basement level courtroom  —      —   where recent arrestees are brought in several at a time. The presiding magistrate judge typically spends just a few minutes on each case to decide whether to keep defendants in custody or release them. A Pretrial Services Agency report, summarizing the defendant’s criminal history, is given to the judge. On Pitt’s report, there was a note that a Pretrial Services Agency employee had spoken on the phone with Pitt’s supervision officer. Pitt’s compliance was poor, the report stated. The report did not mention that CSOSA had lost contact with Pitt or that he was supposed to be wearing a GPS bracelet. It did warn the judge that no release options would assure “safety to the community. ” Cliff Keenan, the director of the Pretrial Services Agency, said such language indicates that a defendant has been assessed as “high risk. ” On Oct. 2, Nooter was the presiding magistrate judge. A transcript of the brief proceeding reveals that there was confusion about Pitt’s GPS monitoring. “It just says that he had a GPS monitoring device that appeared to be tampered with. It doesn’t indicate that he was supposed to be wearing a GPS device,” Nooter said that day. Noting that Pitt’s compliance with his supervised release had been poor, the prosecutor requested a “  hold,” a   action commonly used for offenders who have violated the terms of their release from prison. The hold would allow CSOSA time to request a warrant from the Parole Commission to keep Pitt in custody. Nooter denied the request. He did not explain his reasoning during the hearing. Instead, he told Pitt to return to court later that month and to check in with his supervision officer by the following week. He also told Pitt that he must not commit any more crimes. “Mr. Pitt, I’m going to release you in this matter on your personal promise to return to court,” the judge told him. Pitt was not refitted with a new GPS bracelet before he was ushered back into the community. Nooter declined to be interviewed for this article. For Krepp, the Hill East neighborhood commissioner, the decision to release Pitt is maddening. “Someone said, ‘I look at his background, and I think he’s okay,’ ” she said. “And that individual owes my neighbor an apology. Because but for him being released, he would not have been in this neighborhood. ”    People walk near the   Metro station down the block from the Hill East neighborhood that was traumatized by a rape last October. (Matt   Washington Post)  Whereabouts unknown Oct. 6 was the deadline for Pitt to report back to his CSOSA supervision officer. He failed to do so. If he had checked in that day, he would have been refitted with a GPS bracelet, according to Sipes, the CSOSA spokesman. The day Pitt missed his deadline, just before dawn, a    woman was sleeping in her bed in her apartment on Michigan Avenue NE, in a neighborhood close to Catholic University and the Brookland Metro stop. When she woke up, a tall man  —   later identified in charging documents as Pitt  —   was standing next to her bed. “I will get out of here,” he told her. He allegedly took her tote bag, her phone and her wallet, along with a photograph of her mother. That same day, in an attempt to return Pitt to custody despite the magistrate’s ruling, CSOSA filed an “alleged violation report” to request that the Parole Commission issue a warrant for his arrest. “By the time a warrant is requested, there is a very substantive reason that someone should go back to jail,” commission spokesman Bacchus said. The U. S. Parole Commission took seven days to grant that request. In the meantime, no one was out looking for Pitt. A parole commissioner signed off on the warrant on Oct. 13. The signed warrant had to be mailed to the U. S. Marshals, who would then enter it into the National Crime Information Center database, allowing law enforcement officers to arrest Pitt. The signed warrant did not arrive at the U. S. Marshals until Oct. 23 and was entered into the database that day, according to a Marshals spokesman. “We don’t sit on requests for warrants,” said Supervisory Deputy Linwood Battle.  On Oct. 13, Pitt allegedly entered the    woman’s home in Hill East, through an unlocked door, and raped her. He allegedly stole her cellphone, her husband’s checks and cash and fled to the   Metro station, where he was recorded on surveillance video.  A task force composed of D. C. police, Secret Service and U. S. Capitol Police officers began to track the cellphone belonging to the victim. The next day, Oct. 14, officers pinpointed the cellphone at a gas station in Prince George’s County, Md. When an officer approached Pitt at the station, he ran and was eventually wrestled to the ground, a police report says. One officer needed medical care after the struggle, according to court records. Pitt had in his possession the cellphones of both the burglary and rape victims, according to the charges filed in D. C. Superior Court. In December, Pitt was extradited to Washington. He remains in jail awaiting trial. In April, the U. S. attorney’s office indicted Pitt on 10 charges related to the alleged rape and burglary. Earlier this spring, Pitt was also indicted on charges related to the drug arrest in the library, including tampering with his GPS bracelet.   Steven Rich, Peter Hermann and Keith L.

"     Jonny McCoy didn’t intend to practice criminal law. “I wanted to be like Tom Cruise in ‘The Firm,’ ” says the Myrtle Beach, S. C.  attorney. “I was chasing all that company money. ” That all changed in October 2009 when he spotted three Columbia, S. C. police officers roughing up his friend Keith McAllister outside a bar in the trendy Five Points area. McCoy attempted to ask the officers why they were apprehending his friend, but barely got the words out before he was shoved, apprehended and arrested himself on charges of interfering with a police officer and resisting arrest. McCoy and McAllister were jailed overnight. When they woke, they discovered that one of their cellmates had hanged himself. Video of the arrest later revealed major discrepancies in the police’s account of their interactions with both men. After the video was released, the officers pleaded the Fifth Amendment rather than testify at McCoy’s trial. The charges were later dropped, and McCoy settled his lawsuit with the city. (See the previous installment of this series for more on the case.) Today, criminal law occupies a lot of McCoy’s time. “That really opened my eyes,” McCoy says of his arrest. “I was sheltered, I guess. I had no idea how bad it was. But to be falsely arrested and accused like that spurred something inside me. It made me want to take criminal cases. And what happened to me was pretty minor. It’s nothing like what happens to people like Julian. ” That would be Julian Betton, a    Myrtle Beach man left paralyzed after a drug raid on his home in April 2015. McCoy represents him. After an investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) special prosecutor Kevin Brackett announced in July 2015 that the officers would not face criminal charges in the shooting. SLED investigates   shootings in all but one county in South Carolina. It’s commonly seen as the most elite law enforcement agency in the state. Defenders point to its independence as an outside agency as a boon to its integrity when looking into police shootings. McCoy says the case is yet another example of how SLED falls well short of its reputation. “Independence?” McCoy asks, incredulously. “There’s no independence. These cops lied  —   and that’s the right word. They lied. They nearly killed a man over $100 worth of pot, and then they lied about it. And the SLED investigators and the solicitors do everything they can to defend them. SLED’s primary role in these cases is to protect other cops. ” The raid on Betton’s home came after a confidential informant made two $50 purchases of marijuana from Betton in his apartment. The ensuing raid was conducted by 12 officers from the 15th Circuit Drug Enforcement Unit, a   task force consisting of officers pulled from several local police agencies. Every officer who participated in the raid later claimed that someone on the raid team clearly knocked and announced the police presence before one officer took a battering ram to Betton’s door. That’s an important claim, because the investigating officer didn’t request a   warrant. “The statements, the verbiage, it’s almost identical. Twelve different officers, and it’s nearly identical,” McCoy says. Ideally, officer statements should be in their own words. Police watchdog groups say boilerplate language smacks of coaching, particularly when it includes legalese drawn from court opinions. Several officers claimed to be wearing clothing that clearly indicated they were law enforcement. Four claimed that upon entering the home, Betton fired a handgun at them. Within a couple of seconds of entering, three officers then unleashed a barrage of bullets in Betton’s direction. “They sprayed the walls, the floor, the ceiling,” McCoy says. “They filled that place with bullets. ” In the end, agents David Belue, Frank Waddell and Chris Dennis together fired at least 57 shots, according to WPDE. Julian Betton fell to the ground when the first bullets hit him. They kept firing. A bullet struck his left arm. Another entered his back; another, his rectum. He was shot in each thigh. One bullet went through a wall, traversed a basketball court and stuck in the wall of a house nearby. Betton was hit nine times in all. He ended up losing his gallbladder and parts of his bowel, colon and rectum. The bullets also damaged his liver, small intestine and pancreas. His lung partially collapsed. His left leg was broken. One of his vertebrae was partially destroyed; two others were fractured. He’ll never walk again or be able to have kids of his own. He’ll also need to use a colostomy bag for the rest of his life. The Sun News’s Charles Perry reported that when the shooting finally stopped, one officer ordered Betton to roll over and put his hands on his head. He replied, “I can’t, I’m paralyzed. ” He spent the next six weeks in a coma. Over the next several months, Betton was portrayed in the local media as a dangerous drug dealer and   cop killer. The police announced that they’d found about eight ounces of marijuana, $970 in cash, a handgun and an “assault rifle” in his apartment. They noted a security camera outside the apartment door that he had installed. In announcing his decision not to press charges three months later, Brackett said, “This was an armed dealer  —   holed up in his apartment  —   with heavy duty firearms and surveillance equipment. This wasn’t a regular drug pad  —   it was sophisticated. ” But then the officers’ narrative began to fray. The first problem for the officers was the gun they claimed Betton had shot at them. Ballistics testing showed it hadn’t been recently fired. According to McCoy, Betton had bought the gun a few months earlier after an attempted robbery at his home. McCoy says the robbery is also why Betton put in a camera and security system. The officers who shot Betton gave detailed descriptions of seeing him fire his gun at them. After it was clear that Betton hadn’t fired his gun, they amended their statements. Officer Belue added a handwritten note recanting his claim to have seen a muzzle flash. The new story: Betton had merely pointed his gun at them. And according to Brackett, that was still enough to justify the barrage of bullets they fired into Betton’s body. The evidence suggests that at worst, Betton was a   pot dealer. The police had video of him selling $50 worth of pot to a confidential informant  —   a woman described as a longtime friend. They also claim he made another $50 sale to her on another occasion. The eight ounces of marijuana the police found in Betton’s home were also divided into several containers, an indication that he was planning to sell it. But there’s little evidence he was the sort of kingpin worthy of a gunslinging raid by 12 officers. “For what they had on him, he would have gotten probation at the absolute worst,” McCoy says. The officers’ narrative took another hit with the release of the footage from Betton’s security camera. The camera caught the police officers as they arrived in mostly unmarked vehicles. Within seconds they force Betton’s neighbor to the ground at gunpoint, then immediately take a battering ram to Betton’s door. There’s clearly no knock. Two of the officers told SLED investigators that the agent who did the knocking was the same agent the video depicts wielding the battering ram. The video doesn’t have sound, so it’s difficult to say for certain that there was no announcement, but there doesn’t appear to be, given how little time passed. In his statement, Belue claimed that the officer with the battering ram not only knocked, but also then waited several seconds for an answer before taking down the door. The video clearly shows that neither of those things is true.    Footage taken from security camera outside Julian Betton’s door on April 16, 2015. (Court filings in the case Betton v. Knowles)   These aren’t just inconsistencies; they’re critical details. The police officers did not have a   warrant. So if they failed to knock and announce properly, the raid was illegal. The video shows they clearly didn’t knock. But even if they had announced themselves, without a   warrant, the law requires not just a knock, but also for the officers to wait a reasonable period of time before forcing entry. The video shows that they didn’t wait at all. That means Betton would have been legally justified to defend himself. The video also debunked the officers’ claims that they wore clothing that clearly indicated they were police. The video shows officers in backward baseball caps, street clothes, unmarked vests and  . One is wearing a balaclava hood to cover his face. “As far as we can tell, one officer wore a dark vest that said ‘police’ in dark lettering. That’s about it,” McCoy says. “And that officer was toward the back. None of the officers who first confronted Julian and shot him had clothing suggesting they were cops. ” In fact, Santos Garcia, the neighbor the police confronted and took to the ground on the way in, later told a local TV station he had no idea the armed men who confronted him were police. He thought he was being robbed. His wife actually went into their home to retrieve a gun. Santos also said he never heard a knock or announcement. He told SLED investigators, “I’m 100 percent sure they never announced themselves at all. They rammed his door down, they entered, took two steps, about four of them went in there, all big rifles. I don’t know if the guy grabbed a gun or not, but it took two seconds for them to open fire. ” Several of the officers on the raid were wearing body cameras. Yet not only did none of them turn their cameras on before the raid began, but they all also activated their cameras at about the same time  —   after Betton had been shot, according to McCoy. According to Betton’s lawsuit against the officers, when the neighbor who lived upstairs from Betton figured out what was happening, she returned with a camera and began taking photos of the raid. About an hour later, agents from the task force entered her apartment without a warrant, searched it and arrested her for possession of drug paraphernalia  —   which turned out to be some loose tobacco in an ashtray. According to the Sun News, the SLED report makes only a cursory mention of the security camera footage, noting, “The digital video footage captured by Betton’s video equipment was downloaded to a DVD, showing DEU making entry into Betton’s residence. ” The paper reports that there’s no mention of how the video contradicts the police statements, much less any attempt to investigate the discrepancies. The video also shows that the officers weren’t wearing clothing that clearly indicated they were police, as nearly all 12 of them claimed. As with other cases examined in this series, the SLED investigators appear to have made no effort at all to look into the credibility of the officers’ story, even when that story was directly contradicted by other evidence. It’s another example where absent overwhelming, unavoidable evidence to the contrary, SLED investigators seem too ready to take officers at their word without any investigation. SLED investigators also don’t question tactics or proportionality of force  —   such as whether it’s necessary or reasonable to send a   raid team barreling into a man’s home over $100 in pot sales. “Julian walked to the store every day,” McCoy says. “He had to walk across an open field to get to it. They couldn’t take the time to learn his habits, and maybe confront him as he’s leaving. They had to break down his door and storm his place with guns. They ruined this guy’s life over some pot. ” According to McCoy, Betton’s mother was also (incorrectly) told that she wasn’t permitted to visit him in the hospital. McCoy also says he himself was threatened with arrest the first time he tried to see Betton. When Betton awoke after six weeks in a coma, he was greeted by a sheriff’s deputy and found his leg had been shackled to the bed. In late June, as Betton was barely out of a coma and still struggling to survive his injuries, prosecutors announced that he’d be charged with three counts related to drug distribution. Seven months later, they filed three additional felony counts for presenting and pointing a firearm  —   one count for each officer who shot him. Those charges are based entirely on the claims of the same police officers who initially  —   and falsely  —   claimed he shot at them. SLED investigators seem particularly reluctant to aggressively investigate shootings stemming from police raids, as the Lori Jean Ellis, Ernest Russell Jr. (discussed earlier in this series) and Betton cases illustrate. And yet another   case from Kershaw County puts an odd twist on the problem. On Oct. 19, 2012, deputies from the Kershaw County Sheriff’s Office and two other sheriff’s offices conducted a joint   raid on Gregory McDaniel. They suspected him of dealing drugs. When McDaniel walked out of his bedroom, one officer shot him in the leg. After McDaniel fell, the officers shot him again, according to McDaniel’s attorney Robert Phillips. (There is a SLED report on the case, but it is not available publicly.) The second bullet destroyed McDaniel’s kidney. The police officers initially claimed that McDaniel tried to wrestle the gun away from one of them. That claim dissipated when forensics testing showed none of McDaniel’s trace DNA on the gun. As the Associated Press reported in October 2015, nearly three years after the raid, SLED investigators still refused to release the names of the police officers who shot him. Though the police initially accused McDaniel of assaulting one of the raiding officers, at some point the SLED investigation apparently turned to the officer who shot McDaniel. Because it’s an ongoing criminal investigation, SLED claims it can’t release the officers’ names or its report, although AP noted that legal experts say there’s no law preventing that. The problem for McDaniel: There’s a   year statute of limitations on filing a lawsuit. He has more than $1 million in medical bills. SLED may be investigating the officer for criminal misconduct, but the slow pace and secrecy of the investigation is protecting the officer from liability. It isn’t clear why it’s taken three years to investigate an incident that transpired in just a few seconds. That, too, is a secret. According to a filing last October, Phillips was finally able to obtain the names of some of the officers through unofficial channels. But he was still reduced to naming “John Does” due to the ongoing secrecy of the investigation. Police shootings typically are over in seconds. Unnecessary shootings may be the product of poor training, aggressive tactics, fear or poor risk assessment, but the lapses in judgment last mere moments. So among some prosecutors, police investigators and perhaps even the public, there’s an impulse to err on the side of giving officers the benefit of the doubt. But other South Carolina cases found in the course of reporting for this series, the lapses in judgment lasted for minutes, days or even months. These injustices weren’t the result of   decisions, but poor decisions that could have been avoided, altered or reversed. Instead, they were compounded. Here, too, there seems to be little accountability when things go very wrong.   Doesn’t pass the sniff test On a morning in late November 2010, William White, then 21, was doing some yardwork at his family’s home in Timmonsville, S. C. A storm had brought tree debris down on the roof and in the yard, and his mother had asked him to clean it up. It wasn’t hot, but it was temperate for late fall  —   the temperature hit 74 that day. After working for an hour or so, White took off his white thermal shirt and continued working in a pair of camouflage hunting pants. At around 11 a. m. Florence County Deputy Eric Barnes slowed as he neared White’s home, then pulled into the driveway. He got out and asked White his name and address. White obliged and told Barnes he lived at the house behind him with his mother, as he had all his life. Barnes then handcuffed White, who had no prior criminal record, and put him in the back of his cruiser. At 10:45 a. m. a neighbor of White’s named Temple Melton told police that an assailant had broken into her home and attacked her. She claimed that the man pushed her into a window, cutting her arms. Notably, she did not at the time make any allegation of sexual assault. She said her assailant was wearing a mask and she couldn’t make out his race, but she did say he was wearing a camouflage shirt and pants. Barnes happened to be nearby when the call went out. White lived about a quarter mile from Melton’s home. He was not wearing a camouflage shirt, but he was wearing camouflage pants, and that was enough to put him in cuffs. Barnes called in his catch and where they could find him. Soon other deputies arrived and began milling about the Whites’ yard. About a half hour later, Deputy Jamie Renfroe arrived at the Melton house with a bloodhound. He brought the dog to the back of the house, the door from which Melton told police her assailant had fled. According to Renfroe, his dog Savanna was able to pick up the intruder’s unique scent with no more than an “open air sniff” of the general vicinity in which he’d been an hour earlier. In that time, several detectives had been at both residences, as well as Melton and her husband. It isn’t exactly clear how Savanna was able to distinguish their scents from that of Melton’s attacker. Dog trainers consulted for this series confirmed what would seem to be common sense: While a bloodhound can certainly track a suspect if given, say, an article of clothing the attacker left behind, there’s no way for a dog to sniff an area where several people are or have recently been present, somehow figure out which of those people is the criminal, and then track that particular person’s scent. Yet Renfroe claimed during the criminal trial that Savanna was not only able to distinguish the assailant’s scent from the scent of all the other people who had been in the house, but the dog also then tracked that scent straight to the White residence. According to Renfroe, the dog climbed up onto the porch, then laid down and whimpered on a jacket and hunting mask lying on the floor. Oddly, Savanna didn’t alert to White himself, who was nearby. Nor did she alert to the sweaty shirt White had been wearing earlier that day. The shirt and hunting mask belonged to White’s brother and father. They also didn’t match the visual description of the clothing that Melton originally gave to the police. But it was good enough. White was arrested and taken to the Florence County Detention Center. He was charged with   assault and battery and   burglary. He was denied bond and spent the next 145 days in solitary confinement. White spent 22 hours per day in isolation, with an hour in the morning and evening for recreation. The isolation was allegedly for his protection, due to his age and lack of previous experience in the system. But that didn’t diminish the psychological effects. “Oh, I’m sure it affected me,” White says. “I just did a lot of reading, tried to keep my mind occupied. But it eventually wore me down. There would be a hearing or something, and I didn’t want to go. Just leave me in the cell. ” Over the ensuing weeks, a growing collection of evidence suggested that the alleged assault on Melton never happened. Melton had claimed her assailant had repeatedly slammed her head into a shelf, yet the scratches on her head were slight, and photos taken shortly after the alleged attack showed that none of the items on the shelf had been disturbed. She claimed to have been thrown through a window, but photos also show that the screen to the window  —   a screen through which she’d had to have passed in order to break the window  —   remained intact. An expert hired by Christopher Mills, White’s attorney, said the scratches appeared to have been  . In a civil lawsuit White later filed, Mills also wrote that he had become aware of Melton’s “significant use” of opioid prescription painkillers. Months later, Melton made the additional accusation that White had sexually assaulted her. Not only had she not made that claim before, but she had also explicitly denied it. When offered a polygraph, she was deemed too emotionally distressed to take it. Then there were the DNA tests. The county found none of Melton’s DNA on White or his clothes and none of White’s DNA on Melton. “I was really worried about the DNA,” White says. “Once you know that they’re crooked, they’re capable of lying, you start to think anything is possible. I knew that if those DNA results came back positive, it was over. ” Despite all of this, the county pushed ahead with White’s trial. “I was educating myself about prison,” White says. “I read what I could. I’d talk to inmates who had been to prison. They were throwing the book at me, so if I went away, it was going to be for a long time. I kept picturing that drive down the road to some prison, knowing I wouldn’t see the road again until I was a lot older. ” In April 2011, a jury acquitted White on all charges. Despite the fact that he was legally free to go, White alleges, the deputies still held him an extra four hours to process paperwork. In depositions for White’s lawsuit against the county, more details emerged to affirm that he never should have been arrested in the first place. The primary piece of evidence for White’s arrest was his “identification” by Savanna, the bloodhound. Yet in a sworn deposition, Savanna’s handler, Renfroe, conceded that contrary to his testimony at the criminal trial, he wasn’t a certified dog handler, Savanna wasn’t a certified dog, and in fact the two of them had almost no training at all. From Mills’s complaint: At deposition, Deputy Renfroe admitted that he had never been admitted as an expert in bloodhounds, before or since the White trial. At deposition, he admitted he has no formal training in the science of bloodhounds; he has never taken any formal academic courses; and he has never read any books, or training manuals on training bloodhounds. He could not refer to any considered treatise or authoritative source on training bloodhounds. He has not read nor is aware of the National Bloodhound Association training manual, which was produced by the State to the defense before the criminal trial as part of Savanna’s training . . . Deputy Renfroe testified his expertise is based on “training and experience”. He admitted his only training and experience was working as a reserve officer for Florence County, and assisting the canine team by serving as the runner or decoy during training. He did not handle the dogs, but was just around them. Eventually he joined the canine team and was given Savanna. In deposition, Deputy Renfroe admitted that Savanna was nine months old and had no training when he got her in 2008. He testified that Savanna is not a purebred bloodhound, and there is no registered paperwork on her. The evidence shows that Renfroe repeatedly and drastically overstated the training he and the dog had received. Renfroe claimed at White’s trial that he had been a certified dog handler for four years. He hadn’t. He claimed he had been certified by both the National Police Bloodhound Association and the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy. He hadn’t. He claimed that the dog had been certified in picking up scents from the “point last seen. ” Such certification doesn’t exist. Renfroe was never punished or disciplined for wildly overstating his credentials, nor was he punished or disciplined for the misidentification of White. Instead, he was given a new dog and transferred to narcotics, where he and his dog now search motorists for illegal drugs. The sheriff’s office did not return a request for comment, but you can read its motion to dismiss White’s lawsuit here.  There was never a SLED investigation of White’s arrest. This month, White settled with Florence County. The precise terms of the settlement haven’t been finalized, but it’s less than the statutory cap under state law. “William wanted to expose what happened here,” Mills says. “It wasn’t about the money for him. It was about letting people know what happened. He went through a lot, and he didn’t want to sit through another trial. ” White’s face was published on the cover of South Carolina Mugshots, a newspaper that prints photos of arrestees that’s available at gas stations and convenience stores. “I mostly had trust in the police, in the system before all of this,” White says. “I don’t anymore. Honestly, it just pisses me off. I just wish they had done their jobs. Done them the right way. I mean, you’re talking about people’s lives here. ” Mills had a similar case in North Charleston in which a young man was picked up on little to no evidence. William Waddy was detained in July 2012 by Officer Kenneth Jerome Ford of the North Charleston Police Department. Ford had just visited a basketball court where there had been an altercation earlier in the day. According to police interviews with Ford, Waddy and another NCPD officer named William Ahl, though there was no fight when Ford arrived, he still detained someone who went by the nickname of “Sandman” for cursing, put him in his patrol car and said he was going to lock him up for disorderly conduct. As Ford was driving with Sandman in the backseat, he slowed down at an apartment complex and said something to Waddy. Later that day, he returned to the complex, confronted Waddy and put him in handcuffs. He then called Ahl to meet him. Waddy, who was at the complex visiting his girlfriend, later said that when he asked why he was being arrested, Ford replied, “Whatever the f —   —   —   I want to. ” When he tried to put Waddy into the car, Waddy resisted. Ahl then removed his Taser and pointed it at Waddy, who then got into the car. With Ahl trailing, Ford drove Waddy 2. 5 miles to an isolated office park. According to Waddy, Ford then got him out of the car, struck him in the head and the side and kicked his shoes. Ahl, who would later say he was “uneasy” about the whole situation, said he never saw Ford hit Waddy, but also wasn’t watching the entire time. According to Waddy, Ford said he fit the description of another man who had cursed at him on the basketball court, and said, “You think you can talk trash to the police?” But Ford apparently changed his mind, telling Waddy, “Matter of fact, you ain’t even him. ” Waddy then informed Ford that he was recording the entire exchange on his cellphone. He actually wasn’t but feared what Ford would do next. According to Waddy, Ford then reached into his pocket, pulled out the phone, stepped on it with his foot, smashed it with his flashlight, then tossed into some bushes. He then removed Waddy’s handcuffs and told him, “Find your best way home. ” At about 1 a. m. the next morning, Ford sent a text message to Ahl that read, “If they ask anything, tell them we took that guy to Oakridge Plaza. ” The text message is likely what did Ford in. He was eventually fired and charged with a single criminal count of official misconduct and pleaded guilty in July 2013. His sentence: a $750 fine. The judge who sentenced Ford was Stephanie McDonald. Prior to her appointment to the bench, McDonald worked for a law firm that says it “specializes in the civil defense of governmental entities such as police agencies, fire departments, EMS services and governmental hospitals” and represented police officers sued in civil rights cases. While that doesn’t necessarily mean she can’t be an impartial judge in such cases, attorneys who take police cases say it’s emblematic of how the people who hold positions with the power to hold law enforcement accountable inevitably seem to have ties to law enforcement. McDonald’s former law partner has been general counsel for the South Carolina Sheriff’s Association since 1999. Ahl was allowed to resign without any blemish on his record. He then took a job with the sheriff’s office in Berkeley County. “Ford could have been charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault, theft, any number of serious charges,” Mills says. “But he was charged with one count of the least serious crime they could find. You’ll never see that with a suspect who isn’t a police officer. They get charged with everything the solicitor can think of. But police officers get the least serious charges, when they’re charged at all. ” Under South Carolina’s victims rights law, Waddy should also have been informed of the case against Ford and been permitted to testify before his sentencing. Instead, he learned of Ford’s conviction when his mother read about it in the newspaper. “They told me that because the charge was public misconduct, the real victim wasn’t Waddy, but the city of North Charleston,” Mills says.   The ambidextrous deputy A final and particularly odd case, out of Lee County, demonstrates the lengths to which South Carolina’s police agencies will go to shield misconduct. On Dec. 12, 2012,    Forrest Tindall had just returned from a VFW holiday party when he inadvertently set off the alarm system in his home. Two Lee County deputies, Louis Torres and Leroy Solomon, responded. What happened next is unclear  —   that’s part of the problem. But it ended with a bullet owned by the Lee County Sheriff’s Office lodged in Tindall’s shoulder. Shortly after the shooting, Tindall’s wife and her sister, Betty Skinner, returned home from shopping. Skinner would later say in depositions that Sheriff Daniel Simon told her one deputy’s gun accidentally discharged as he tripped while walking up the steps to the house. Gerry Mull, a friend of Skinner’s, heard the same thing. A local news article published the next day also reported that Tindall was shot when an officer tripped, causing his gun to accidentally discharge and send a bullet through the door. But then the story changed. Shortly after the shooting, another deputy obtained a search warrant for Tindall’s home. In his sworn affidavit, that deputy stated that Torres told him that Tindall “confronted” him. In his statement to SLED, Torres confessed to being the shooter but claimed his gun had gone off inadvertently. He claimed that he approached the door while Solomon drove around back in the patrol car. He pulled his gun, opened the screen and grasped the door handle. As he did, he says his gun accidentally discharged. There was no tripping on the steps and no confrontation. When the ballistics reports came back later, they showed that the bullet’s trajectory could only mean that the door was at least partially open. Moreover, because of the layout of the house, the only way Torres’s story could have checked out is if he was  . But he wasn’t. On the form for testing his hands for gunshot residue, he’s listed as  . In his personnel file, he’s listed as  . And Torres was always seen wearing a   holster, including at his deposition years later. Yet within 24 hours of SLED receiving the ballistics reports  —   the details of which were not supposed to be shared outside the department during the investigation  —   the Lee County Sheriff’s Office released a typed statement from Deputy Daniel Feeney Jr. who handles the department’s firearms training. Feeney stated that in two previous training sessions, the previous October and the previous February, Torres had drawn his gun with his right hand, then switched over and shot it with his left. Feeney further wrote that Torres was so good at shooting with his left hand, he decided to do so permanently. Policing experts consulted for this series say that switching hands that way is highly unusual  —   and dangerous. Ken Katsaris, a use of force expert retained by Tindall and who, as noted previously, testifies in defense of police officers about three times more often than he testifies against them, wrote in his report on the case, “In all of my years as a police and firearms instructor, I have never seen this scenario before. ”  Despite the fact that Feeney claimed to have witnessed this and spoken to Torres about it on two separate occasions, Feeney never noted it in Torres’s personnel file. Months later though, he managed to recall these incidents, which happened to be critical for reconciling Torres’s account of the shooting with the physical evidence. “The swiftness with which the statement from the firearms instructor was released strongly suggests that the SLED investigation wasn’t independent,” says Walter Katz, who serves as the independent police auditor for San Jose, Calif. “A truly independent investigation should be sealed off. The implication here is that the agency being investigated has knowledge of what the investigators are finding, and if they’re so inclined, can then alter the paper trail. ” Feeney testified that he told Torres after the February incident that if he wanted to shoot   he should get a   holster. He claimed to have told Torres the same thing again after the October session. Torres and Sheriff Simon said in their own depositions that Torres was given a   holster in February 2012. Yet Torres’s partner says he never saw him wearing a   holster. Even on the day of his deposition for Tindall’s lawsuit three years later, Torres was wearing a   holster. Yet he claimed in the same deposition that on the night of the shooting, he wore a   holster and shot  .    At left, Forrest Tindall’s front door, with a dowel showing the trajectory of the bullet that struck him. At right, diagram showing how the shooter would have to have been holding the gun in his left hand. (Courtesy of Robert Phillips)  About a month after the statement about Torres shooting   appeared, crime lab analysis of some debris in Tindall’s home determined it to be a piece of the front door that was ejected when the bullet passed through. The problem: Because of the position of the debris in the home, the shot could only have been fired in a way consistent with Torres’s story if the front door had not been closed. So the police story changed again  —   the door, they now said, was open when Torres fired, not closed. “The officer’s story is supposed to be what the officer perceived at the time,” says Seth Stoughton, a former police officer who currently teaches and studies police law at the University of South Carolina School of Law. “What troubles me here is the number of times the story morphs to fit the facts. The officer’s perception at the time doesn’t change later because of new information. ” Stoughton stresses that the problem isn’t necessarily that the officer’s account is inconsistent with the forensic evidence. “Memory is fallible. We shouldn’t think that just because an officer’s story doesn’t perfectly fit the facts, he must be lying. Officers will make mistakes, so we should expect some inconsistency. But the inconsistencies need to be investigated to see if they’re reasonable. The problem here is that the story changed each time there were new facts. ” There are other problems with the police version of events. First, there’s the role of Torres’s partner, Deputy Solomon. It’s tactically unsound  —   and implausible  —    for one officer to stay in the patrol car while the other responds to a burglar alarm. Ken Katsaris said in his deposition that it is “inconceivable” that one officer would be driving around in his car while his partner “is grabbing and drawing his gun and approaching a place where he believes there could be a hostage situation or a burglar or a robber inside, or somebody’s injured. ” Another result of forensic testing suggests an effort to protect not just Torres, but also Solomon. The back of Solomon’s   hand tested positive for gunshot residue. That’s odd, given that Solomon not only claimed to have been in the car, away from Torres when Torres fired, but also testified that he hadn’t fired a gun in weeks. The presence of gunshot residue on his hand strongly suggests he was in the immediate vicinity when Torres fired. While a narrative that put Solomon in the car might have looked bad from a procedural standpoint, it could have been quite a bit worse for Solomon to have participated in a response that resulted in the shooting of an innocent   old man: Two days after the shooting, he was due to be named chief of police for the nearby town of Lynchburg. The SLED investigators did very little to probe these discrepancies, the bizarre explanations for the shooting or the way those explanations evolved as the forensic evidence changed. SLED also didn’t probe whether Sheriff Simon was ever made aware of Torres’s alleged bizarre method of shooting, which Katsaris, Katz and Stoughton all say would be not only unusual, but also dangerous  —   and certainly the sort of thing a sheriff ought to know. The indications of the free flow of information between SLED investigators and the sheriff’s office also cast more doubt on the agency’s purported independence. There are so many versions of how Forrest Tindall was shot, it’s nearly impossible to say how it actually happened. Katsaris concluded in his report, however, that, “my total assessment in reviewing all the facts, many inconsistencies, and sworn testimony leads me to only one conclusion about the shot fired by Torres: That it was not accidental or unintentional. ” That is, Torres didn’t accidentally fire his gun, but intentionally fired it, at Tindall, most likely after mistaking Tindall for a burglar or robber. For liability purposes, there’s a big difference between the two. Lee County recently settled with Tindall for about $500, 000, close to the maximum he could have received under state law.   Race and policing in South Carolina South Carolina’s police problems, of course, affect everyone in the state, yet as with most discussions of the criminal justice system, race certainly seems to be a factor. As this series has shown, poor training, lack of oversight and accountability, and a culture of coverup can claim victims of any class or color. But it’s also clear that people of color are disproportionately on the receiving end of police abuse. A 2015 Post and Courier investigation found that while blacks make up 28 percent of the state’s population, they comprise more than half the people shot by law enforcement officers. Of course, it’s difficult to say what percentage of those shootings was justified or what percentage of them could have been avoided. But of the cases examined in this series in which there are serious questions about a police shooting or action, Melvin Lawhorn, Lori Jean Ellis, the three named victims of Deputy Ben Fields, Walter Scott, Levar Jones, Ernest Russell, Walter Bailey, Ernest Satterwhite, Bryant Heyward, Elijah Pontoon and Kelvin Hayes are black.   incidents also tend to cast light on racial disparities previously overlooked or unnoticed. Another Post and Courier investigation found 146, 000 traffic stops in North Charleston between 2010 and 2014 in which the police officer didn’t issue a citation. Of those   pretext stops, 65 percent involved black drivers. Blacks make up 47 percent of the city’s population. The paper found similar disparities all over the state. The state’s policing problems affect everyone, but there’s little doubt that they disproportionately affect people of color. Defenders of the state’s police will argue that the arrest rates simply reflect the relative crime rates among the black and white populations, although that doesn’t really explain the statistics on pretext stops. The only other benign explanation  —   that cops are more likely to let black drivers off with a warning even when they’ve committed an infraction  —   seems unlikely. Black people in the state certainly feel as though they’re still targeted. After the Walter Scott shooting, dozens of black residents of North Charleston came forward with their own stories of racial profiling, harassment and abuse by local police. “They’re shooting up folks,” says Brenda Edwards, Julian Betton’s mother, in a video for the Myrtle Beach Sun News. “It’s horrible here, period. So they take the [Confederate battle] flag down. That [doesn’t] stop the prejudice. It doesn’t stop them from doing whatever they want to black folks. Ain’t nothing different. Ain’t nothing different. ”   (Note: The Kershaw County Sheriff’s Office, the Lee County Sheriff’s Office and the Florence County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for interviews. A public information officer with SLED initially agreed to set up an interview with chief Mark Keel but then didn’t call back.) Coming in Part 4: How can South Carolina fix its police culture?"
"     She’s known in local newspapers as    “Emily Doe”  —   a pseudonym to protect her privacy amid an emotional court battle in which former Stanford University varsity swimmer Brock Allen Turner was found guilty for her sexual assault. Prosecutors said that in January 2015, witnesses saw Turner sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster on campus. The case came to a close Thursday when the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county jail and then probation, and ordered him to register as a sex offender for three sexual assault counts: assault with the intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person, according to Palo Alto Online. When handing down Turner’s sentence, the judge in the case said he feared that imprisonment would have a “severe” impact on Turner. Then his victim stood in the packed courtroom in Palo Alto and delivered what Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen called “the most eloquent, powerful and compelling piece of victim advocacy that I’ve seen in my 20 years as a prosecutor,” according to Palo Alto Online. “You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today,” she read in court from her victim impact statement, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office. “The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. ”   [Former Stanford swimmer gets six months in jail for sexual assault of unconscious woman]   The   letter, which was published by Palo Alto Online and BuzzFeed News, has been released by Santa Clara County. Here is the victim’s impact statement in full: Your honor, If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly. You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today. On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there’s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself “big mama” because I knew I’d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college. The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don’t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence. Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me. I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said “Rape Victim” and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it’s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions. After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don’t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn’t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else. On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don’t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes. My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I’m right here, I’m okay, everything’s okay, I’m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P. E. teacher, let’s go home, let’s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me. My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, “I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?” I was horrified. That’s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, “What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?” I said yes, and hung up to cry. I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don’t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn’t real. I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn’t talk, I didn’t eat, I didn’t sleep, I didn’t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn’t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn’t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer. One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That’s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn’t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don’t even know this person. I still don’t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can’t be me. This can’t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings. At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he’s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that’s what we’re doing. I’m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your   to cancel out all the sickening things that’ve happened. The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it’s upsetting, just know that I’m okay, I’m right here, and I’m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay. The night after it happened, he said he didn’t know my name, said he wouldn’t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn’t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn’t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue. The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my [buttocks] and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it. I thought there’s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He’s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused. I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn’t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don’t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation. When I was told to be prepared in case we didn’t win, I said, I can’t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don’t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That’s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn’t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing. Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney’s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn’t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like: How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What’d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I’d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we’ll let Brock fill it in. I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn’t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don’t line up, she’s out of her mind, she’s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he’s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he’s having a really hard time right now. And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn’t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn’t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember. So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so. He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He’d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don’t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there’s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He’s in the clear. Even in this story, there’s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn’t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we “met” I’m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn’t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can’t do that, then no. Don’t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency. According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don’t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that’s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare [buttocks] and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her. Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you’d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn’t say, “Stop! Everything’s okay, go ask her, she’s right over there, she’ll tell you. ” I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn’t speak because of what he’d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a   girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn’t make sense. Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don’t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you’re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn’t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, “At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately. ” Here’s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn’t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn’t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me? You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would’ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don’t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That’s what you’ll never have a good answer for, that’s what you can’t explain even after a year. To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense. My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that’s what happens when you finger someone, and he’s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I’m silly and that’s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is   especially to any nameless man that approaches me. The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney’s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself. You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that’s twelve votes per count,   yeses confirming guilt, that’s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement. If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I’m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don’t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused. I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant’s statement and respond to them. You said, Being drunk I just couldn’t make the best decisions and neither could she.  Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference. You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room. I’m not mad because you didn’t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don’t care if you know their phone number or not. You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong. Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect [penis] in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this. You said, During the trial I didn’t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case. Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words. You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to “speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. ” Speak out against campus drinking culture. That’s what we’re speaking out against? You think that’s what I’ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less. Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don’t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There’s your first powerpoint slide. I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct. Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life. Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was “unconscious intoxicated woman” ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the   swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something. My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry,   tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be. I can’t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o’clock in the morning. I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone’s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry. You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn’t want anyone’s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be. Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I’m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I’ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak. I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney’s closing statement began, “My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister. ” You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her. If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering. You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on. I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you’ll begin to help others. Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer’s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks. My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice. I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer’s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft   a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing. Unfortunately, after reading the defendant’s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can’t even see that distinction. The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better. As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone’s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn’t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class. The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an   guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me. The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant’s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That’s all I’m going to say. He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn’t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn’t expire, doesn’t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it’s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life. A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he’s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it? Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person. To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me. Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget. And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can’t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can’t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you."
"       Donald Trump fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday after months of tensions between Lewandowski and Trump convention manager Paul Manafort. The move reportedly came at the urging of Trump’s children    most notably his daughter, Ivanka. Lewandowski sat down with CNN’s Dana Bash for an interview on Monday after his dismissal. It’s was, um, a bizarre conversation in which Lewandowski  repeatedly suggested everything was going awesomely! and praised Trump time and time again.  Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  BASH: And Corey Lewandowski is here with me. Thank you very much for coming in. So many questions to ask. First, from your perspective, what happened? Why were you fired? LEWANDOWSKI: I don’t know. I don’t know the answer to that. But what I know is what we’ve been able to achieve in this election cycle has been historic. You know, we had a candidate who in June of last year announced he was going to run for president with no elected office experience, in a field of 16 other people in the race plus him, who’s gone on to do something historic, which was get almost 14 million votes and fundamentally changed the way people look at politics. And I’m proud to have been a small part of that. And running as the outsider of this campaign, which he has done, running against the corrupt Washington, D. C. establishment and political correctness has been something I’ve been proud to be a part of. Things change as the campaign evolves and a general campaign against a very   giant organization like the Clinton campaign is very different than running against those smaller primary state elections. Even when it was a big day. BASH: So you think it was appropriate for Donald Trump to make the change and let you go? LEWANDOWSKI: What I think is that the voters have a binary decision coming up on election day. They can either vote for Hillary Clinton and her liberal policies or they can put someone in place who’s actually to change Washington. And I will do everything I can to make sure that the latter of those two happens, which means, Donald Trump is elected president. If I can do that inside the campaign, it’s a privilege. If I can do that outside the campaign, that’s also a privilege. BASH: Did Mr. Trump himself call you this morning and say    I don’t mean to use this term, but it is the term, ”You’re fired”? LEWANDOWSKI: I had a nice conversation with Mr. Trump and I said to him it’s been an honor and a privilege to be part of this. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I think as you look at how small this team has been and how   this team has been, it’s really important to know that there are highs and lows in every campaign and we’ve been through them together. And in order to be successful, we need to continue to build that team and build those relationships with the RNC and utilize the resources that they have available to us. So that is where the campaign is going, and it’s been a great privilege. And look, I wouldn’t change one second. The hardest part for me has been just not being able to spend the time with my family that I want over the last 18 or 19 months, but I would not look back. I have no regrets. It’s such a privilege and an honor to have been a very small part of this, to learn and experience what he’s been able to achieve and the electoral success that he’s had. It’s been truly amazing. BASH: Were you surprised? Were you blindsided? LEWANDOWSKI: I don’t know if it’s so much of that. I mean, you know, there’s been a lot of conjecture in the media lately about what’s going on well and what isn’t going on well in the campaign. I think a lot of that is just the media trying to hype up a campaign. You know, what we have is we’ve got a candidate on the other side who’s under criminal investigation from the FBI that most of the mainstream doesn’t want to talk about. Instead they want to talk about things that Donald Trump did or said 20 or 30 or 40 years ago. And even when he gives a great policy speech, and he’s probably the best speaker that, you know, our country has ever seen as a presidential candidate, he doesn’t get credit for those things. BASH: I want to get into some of the specifics about how the campaign was run and where you are right now. But before that, were you escorted out of the building by security today? LEWANDOWSKI: I’d say it doesn’t work like that. I mean, obviously, there are protocols in place that when someone is no longer an employee, they just make sure    there’s no escorting out. And, look, I’ve had the privilege of working with these people for 19 months. They’re friends of mine. But there’s a protocol and everyone follows the same protocol regardless of who that is and I think that’s the right thing. BASH: So yes, you were, but that was part of the protocol. LEWANDOWSKI: Well, it wasn’t security. I was a friend from the office. BASH: OK. Let’s get to what went on inside the campaign. Sources who I’ve talked to and others have talked to said that they described you as a hothead and that you just didn’t treat people right. What do you say to that? LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I think I’m a very intense person. And my expectation is perfection because I think it’s what Mr. Trump deserves. I think he deserves the very best because he has put his life and his fortune into this campaign, spending tens of millions of dollars to go do something that, candidly, he didn’t need to do. He’s had a great life but he wants to change the country for the better. And I see how hard he has worked in this campaign. He works 18, 19, 20 hours a day consistently. BASH: But this has been    but the question is about you. LEWANDOWSKI: Because    I understand. Because leadership starts at the top and I see what he’s put into the campaign and when I see someone who I don’t think is working as hard as the person who’s funding the campaign, who’s the campaign principal, meaning the candidate, yes, that bothers me. Because leadership is at the top. And I’ve never asked somebody to do something in this campaign I wasn’t willing to do myself and Mr. Trump has never asked me to do something he wasn’t willing to do himself. You know, I’ve had the privilege of traveling with him a lot and he doesn’t sleep on the plane; he just works all the time. That’s the mindset and the tenacity and the intensity he would bring to being the President of the United States. And I think you can expect that out of people. We don’t have    we never had 700 people at the campaign. We ran that campaign with 70 people    more efficient, more effective, leaner, meaner. Does that mean sometimes you need people to do extra and stay late and get in early? You bet you do. BASH: OK, I want to get that to that in a minute. I just also want to put up on the screen    I don’t know if you’ve seen this but oOne of the senior advisors forMr. Trump put out a tweet almost immediately after you were fired. Michael Caputo. ”Ding dong, the witch is dead.” That doesn’t happen, Corey; as you know, you’ve worked in a lot of campaigns. I don’t mean that    to put that up to be hurtful to you, but it’s just the reality. LEWANDOWSKI: Well, let’s just be clear. Michael Caputo isn’t a senior adviser. He has no formal role with the campaign. He’s a volunteer. And so he doesn’t get paid by the campaign. He has no formal role with the campaign. (CROSSTALK) BASH: But for anybody involved with the campaign and wants the best for Donald Trump    LEWANDOWSKI: He’s not involved with the    BASH:    as you do, to put that out? LEWANDOWSKI: Look, people are entitled to their own opinions. BASH: I wouldn’t have put that up had I not    had it not been kind of a narrative that we were hearing, and I’m sure that’s why you wanted to come on, to try to push back on a lot of that. LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I think in all campaigns, you’ve got detractors and you’ve got supporters. That’s the nature of the beast. And I think if you went out and talked    look, I don’t know Michael Caputo. He’s a volunteer who’s been to the campaign for three or four weeks. I think he’s actually in Cleveland; I don’t really know what he does for the campaign. But if you talk to the people who have been here from the beginning, when you look at state directors who’ve been here from the beginning, the people who have been in the trenches, who understand and have seen Mr. Trump’s work ethic and what he’s been able to accomplish in their states, whether it’s in New Hampshire or Nevada, South Carolina, Iowa, or any of those early states where no one gave him a chance and he went out and became successful and became the Republican nominee    I think if you asked them, they’d stand toe to toe with me any day of the week and 20 hours a day to make sure that they had the same work ethic I do. And I think that’s what I try to foster with the people I’ve worked with. BASH: Now, sources from the campaign, from in and around the campaign, have told us they thought that you were feeding Mr. Trump’s worst instincts. In that, you know, he    one of your lines is ”Let Trump be Trump” right? But that if there was a plan in place,   primary, now that he’s trying to pivot to the general, is in the general, that you would get on the plane with him and undercut that plan and bring out his worst instincts. How do you respond to that? LEWANDOWSKI: Like I say, what vested interest would I have in doing that? I think what you have to remember    BASH: I think the act    the suggestion is it’s just    it’s who you are. LEWANDOWSKI: Yes, but, look, if Donald Trump wins, that’s good for Corey Lewandowski and it’s good for the country. And so when you think about it, why would I want to do anything other than what’s in the very best interest of him in this campaign for the good of the country? I’ve given up 19 months of my life and my family and all of the other things to make sure that he’s in the best possible position. And I’m not the only one. There are many people who have done that. So for anyone to insinuate that I wouldn’t want what’s very best for him    BASH: No. LEWANDOWSKI: Does that mean every time he asks me something, do I push back on it? No. Because, candidly, he has had his finger on the pulse of the American public for the last 16 or 18 months of this campaign and he has seen things that I didn’t see, and he knows how to message things that I don’t know how to do. BASH: Should you have pushed back more in recent weeks now that it’s a totally different ball game? LEWANDOWSKI: No. It’s important to push back on issues that are important. And I think you have to be selective when you do that. Mr. Trump has unparalleled success in the business world. He’s now unparalleled success in the world of politics. And I think when he presents an idea, some ideas are very, very good and they should move forward. Some are pretty good and those should move forward. And the ones that I raelly take exception to, if they are there, I let my opinion be known. And anybody who knows me knows that I don’t just give a yes answer. I give my opinion, probably to my own detriment too many times, and I will fight for my opinions forcefully. Doesn’t mean I’m always right; doesn’t mean I’m always wrong. But what I do say is, I think this is what we should do at this time. At the end of the day, there’s one person who makes the decision on this campaign as it goes forward and it should be that way. BASH: And you mentioned that somebody    people he didn’t see eye to eye with. Let’s talk about Paul Manafort. There has been a lot of discussion; I know it’s out in the media. But, you know, I think it would be hard for you to say that it’s not real, that there was a lot of real tension. What are you    what was the relationship with him? LEWANDOWSKI: So I’ll say this about Paul. When Paul first came in, he was going to manage the delegate process. And then we were fortunate enough to secure enough delegates that we didn’t need a delegate manager. Since that time, Paul and I have gotten along amazingly well and I know the media doesn’t want to report that, but we work side by side, talking on a daily basis, multiple times a day. He had his roles which he was going to oversee on the campaign. I had a very separate function, which included making sure that Mr. Trump’s schedule goes accordingly. Fundraising side of things, right? We divided things accordingly and we had a great relationship. There was no animosity between Paul and I. I know the media doesn’t want to report it, but that’s the truth. BASH: I mean, forgive me for being skeptical, but it’s hard to believe that    that it was as sort of as rsoy and happy as you’re describing when there’s so much discussion of dysfunction. LEWANDOWSKI: (INAUDIBLE). The campaign has been so small, that bringing in a professional in like Paul helped us grow the campaign. And we need ten more of these. The campaign needs to continue to grow to be successful. So everything that Paul did for the campaign was one less thing I had to do. And I’m thankful for that. Believe me! BASH: And he’s still there and you’re not, so it’s hard to see this as    as anything other than, you know, like a power struggle and he won? LEWANDOWSKI: I don’t think that’s the case. You know what I think? I think that this campaign is going to continue to grow. I think Donald Trump is going to be the next President of the United States. If there’s anything to do to make help make that happen, whether that’s advice to Paul, advice to Mr. Trump, or advice anywhere along the line, I’ll be happy to do that. BASH: Let’s talk about Mr. Trump’s family. My understanding    and others here are reporting    is that his children were very forceful in saying ”It’s time for Corey Lewandowski to leave.” Does that surprise you? LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I can say I’ve always had a great relationship with the family and I think I continue to do so. Look, everybody has their own opinions and I think what you have is a transition in the campaign from a very, very successful   primary victory process, which was managed at a   level on the states, or on a   to look to a bigger picture. And that’s OK. There’s nothing wrong with that. So more ideas, more people who are giving input, I think that’s great. That’s important. You know, I’m an implementer. That’s what I try to do. I try and take those ideas which have been laid out and implement them to the best of our ability, and I think that’s the most important thing. And that includes the kids’ input, it includes other professionals’ input, it includes elected officials’ input; it includes the D. C. people’s input. I try and implement what I think    what the collective organization is best for the campaign. That’s all I try and do. BASH: Our understanding is that Ivanka Trump’s husband, Jared Kushner, has been much more involved and was intimately involved in saying it’s time for you, for Corey, to go. Can you tell me about your relationship with him? LEWANDOWSKI: I’ve had a great relationship with Jared. He’s helped us from the onset of having a better online presence. Being aggressive, in a good way, of getting us to have a stronger social media presence. Making sure that we’re posting on our Facebook page. He understands a different component than I understand. So he’s very, very good in that regard and he’s very good at moving the campaign forward in that regard. I think it’s been a great relationship, so I’m not sure where that’s coming from but he’s someone    BASH: But we have some reporting that he found out that you were trying to plant some    stories about him. Is that true? LEWANDOWSKI: I have no interest of doing that. Again, my goal from this campaign, from day one, is to get Mr. Trump elected President of the United States. I’ve been privileged enough    BASH: So that’s not true. LEWANDOWSKI: Absolutely not. BASH: You weren’t trying to undermine him? LEWANDOWSKI: What I want to do is get Mr. Trump to be the President of the United States. That was    that’s been my job and only goal. And that includes focusing on my job. Look, the job as a campaign manager for a presidential campaign    and 16 other guys on the Republican side have had this as well    is to go and implement the best policies for the campaign and build a   team, so that, come November 8th, you can be successful. Sixteen other campaign managers tried this and weren’t successful. I was privileged enough to be successful because we have the best candidate. We have the best speaker; we have the best    we have the person who gets the biggest crowds who won 37 states and primaries and caucuses around the country. So that’s really important to remember. BASH: Two more people and then I want to get to that strategy. Ivanka Trump. LEWANDOWSKI: Great asset to the campaign. I mean    BASH: Would you be surprised if you heard that she was not thrilled with the job that you were doing? LEWANDOWSKI: I don’t think that’s the case. I think Ivanka is somebody who understands her father and is a fantastic surrogate for the campaign. She brings a sense of calmness to the campaign. She has a way about her that she connects immediately not just with women but with business executives. She’s so polished, so professional. It’s been an honor to be able to work with her for the 1ast 18 months. BASH: OK, let’s talk a little bit about the roles that you did have. And we talked a lot about personnel, but about the strategy and about what did not seem to be working that well. Just, for example, there’s new polling out today of Monmouth that has Mr. Trump down 7 points, 47 percent to 40 percent. Do you feel that, as your role as campaign manager, part of the issue was that the campaign wasn’t managed correctly in terms of what he needs to do? Forget about the personnel inside, but to win the White House? LEWANDOWSKI: No. I think what the strategy has been is looking to expand the map from what a traditional Republican campaign would look like. And so if you look four years ago at the states that Mitt Romney lost, states like Florida and Virginia and Pennsylvania, those are places that Donald Trump is going to win. And that fundamentally changes the outcome of this election. So national polls, while they are important, you know what? What’s more important are the   polls. And if you look at states like New Jersey where Donald Trump is winning, in Florida where Donald Trump is winning, Ohio where he’s winning or within the margin. BASH: What makes you think he’s winning? LEWANDOWSKI: If you look at the public polls. Go to RealClearPolitics, you can look at the polls in those respective states. It’s one or two points on either side, within the margin, and those are the states that are going to make a difference. And so, you know, if you want to go and poll the people of Alaska, or you want to poll the people of Idaho, you know, those are all inclusive in those respective national polls. But a presidential election is traditionally run (INAUDIBLE) national scale, it’s done in ten or 11 states. Mr. Trump’s going to run it in a much bigger place, because he has the ability to turn those traditional blue states like Pennsylvania red again. BASH: Well, let’s talk about that. Because the only way to do that, in a traditional campaign    we know that he’s not a traditional candidate; certainly didn’t have a traditional structure in the primaries    but is to build a network, to have field staff. And to do that you have to raise money, if you’re not going to self fund, which he’s not in the general. My understanding is that there’s no fundraising network and that you are relying, the campaign is relying a lot on the RNC infrastructure. But that was your job, right? To fundraise. LEWANDOWSKI: Let me touch on it. We started raising money in the last 30 days or so, because Mr. Trump has   his campaign through the primary, of which we are still part of right now. And Mr. Trump is raising money for the RNC, for their infrastructure, which means their data programs, their field staff. They’ve got 500 field staff in place right now. Four years ago, the RNC had four field staff in place in the key battleground states. BASH: Right. No, I understand that you’re    it’s a different model. You’re relying on the RNC and I’ve done reporting on that. But this is more of a question about the fact that they still need Donald Trump and the Trump campaign to raise money. LEWANDOWSKI: And he’s done that. And if you look at what he did in the last four days, going through Texas and North Carolina and Georgia and Las Vegas and Arizona, he raised $12 million to $15 million for the party in a   swing. That money goes to the joint fundraising agreement so that    the joint fundraising committee so that the RNC will have the resources necessary to put the boots on the ground, to enhance their data program, to make sure that they have all of the resources necessary. BASH: What I’d heard from a source familiar with this is that part of the trouble that he had with fundraising is that the donors didn’t respond to you. Donors are used to being coddled    LEWANDOWSKI: That’s not true. Look, the money is pouring in. BASH: And that they got calls    LEWANDOWSKI: The money is pouring in. When he went out to California and did one event, and I think he raised $6 million or $8 million in one evening in California. And what you saw    what you have seen in the last four or five days, and Reince Priebus was on this trip to Texas, and I think the goal at one particular event was to raise $2 million. They raised $3. 5 million. BASH: So you’re telling me that we’re going to see    LEWANDOWSKI: They’re exceeding expectations. BASH: We’re going to see more money raised than people are describing or saying? LEWANDOWSKI: Absolutely. Not just that, but the money is pouring in. People want to come on board. They want to join the Trump organization. They want to join the Trump train because they know thatif Hillary Clinton is elected President of the United States, it would be four more years of the Obama administration. BASH: But you have that kind of money. My question is, the Clinton campaign has $40 million in ads and has bought ad time for the next six weeks. Donald Trump and his campaign, zero. LEWANDOWSKI: Well, that’s right. BASH: But if you had that kind of money and organization, why wouldn’t you    why would leave the airwaves to her? LEWANDOWSKI: Jeb Bush spent $228 (ph) million    Jeb Bush spent $228 million, or $158 million dollars, running for president in the primary, spending money on major media investments of which did not do him any good. Did not win one state in the primary. We saw Scott Walker do the same thin where he reserved $7 million in ad time and didn’t spend the money. BASH: But you said the primary is a totally different world. LEWANDOWSKI: It is a completely different thing. But what you have to understand is Donald Trump has the ability to bypass the mainstream media if he wants to go directly to the people. That’s something he’s done very successful, and he continues to do that. And that’s something that the mainstream media doesn’t like, but he can go directly to Twitter or to his Facebook account or his Instagram, where he’s got 20 million plus people already following him, and get the message out. Now that’s not to say he won’t do advertising. Because of course he will. But the difference is you can’t just look dollar for dollar of what is being spent by campaign to another campaign, because if money was a metric of success, Donald Trump would not be the Republican nominee right now. Jeb Bush would have been. BASH: No question. I totally    LEWANDOWSKI: Or Ted Cruz, or all these people who   him. BASH: I’m with you on that. But now you had the ability to get the entirety of the Republican Party, the infrastructure, behind Donald Trump. LEWANDOWSKI: And they are. BASH: Money and    but not really. I mean    if they’re    LEWANDOWSKI: Look who’s behind Donald Trump. Mitch McConnell’s behind him; Speaker Ryan’s behind him. Reince Priebus is behind him. BASH:  . LEWANDOWSKI: Yes, they’re raising money. BASH: But not Reince in that. But    LEWANDOWSKI: Reince is raising money. The party is raising money. Mr. Trump is raising money for the party. BASH: But he’s not making it easy for them. LEWANDOWSKI: That’s not true at all. That’s not true at all. Mr. Trump has sat down and had meetings with all kinds of people who want to be part of this campaign, and we put a plan in place with the RNC so that they can have the resources necessary. Now, Mr. Trump could be raising this money for the campaign but he said, no, I want to give the money to the party. I want to make sure that the party has the resources and the boots on the ground and the data programs and the   so that they can be successful. The difference was, four years ago, Romney has his whole team of fundraising and bundlers and the RNC had their whole team of fundraising and bundlers, and when you go into the states, there were two very separate groups of people there. You ahd the Romney people and you had the RNC people with different styles. We’re completely integrated. It’s a very different model and it’s much more efficient than it was four years ago. BASH: OK, so you’re telling me that, at the end of the day, we’re going to see fundraising better than it seems to be now and the infrastructure better. But actually before I go to the    another question I’m going to ask, I want to ask about infrastructure. Because I had reporting that the campaign had 70 people. Other reporting said it was low as 30. That’s nothing. And I know you’re saying it’s a different world. Donald Trump is different. But, again, I just come back to the fact that this is not a primary campaign. You need to reach hundreds of millions of people, not a small slice of the electorate. LEWANDOWSKI: Hillary Clinton had 732 people on the Clinton payroll at the same time Donald Trump had 70 people on the payroll. We had more votes, almost 14 million votes in the primary, than any other Republican candidate. BASH: But this is not a primary campaign. LEWANDOWSKI: I understand. But here’s the difference. Her salaries that are covered by their    have to be 10x what our salaries are, as a comparison. So what they’re doing is they’re taking money and spending it on things. We are leaner, meaner, more efficient, more effective. Get bigger crowds. Get better coverage. It’s very important to understand that Mr. Trump can go directly to the people and that’s not what Hillary has to do. BASH: So you’re    is you’re    LEWANDOWSKI: They’re going to waste millions of dollars on paid advertising, which consultants and others are going to make a fortune on. That’s not the Trump model. BASH: So your philosophy is that you should continue to stay lean and mean. LEWANDOWSKI: No, I think you have to grow, but you have to grow smart and strategic and efficient. Look, if this was the business world, people would be commending Mr. Trump for the way he’s run this campaign. That on $50 million he beat candidates who’ve raised three times that, and in Hillary’s case and Bernie’s case, four and five times that. The difference in politics is they think money equates to votes, and it’s been proven time and time again that the amount of money you spend does not equate to the amount of votes you get. BASH: Corey, you’re painting a very nice picture of the Trump campaign and the state of play. If it was that way, why wouldn’t you still be the campaign manager? LEWANDOWSKI: I’m proud of the campaign. I really am. But I also understand the reality of building an infrastructure, coupled with the RNC’s 500 people on the ground and all the resources necessary    BASH: But why couldn’t you be the person to do it? Why do you think that you were not the person to do it? LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I don’t know the answer to that. But what I know is    BASH: What do you think? LEWANDOWSKI: I know I’ve had a great privilege and an honor of being part of this for the last 18 or 19 months. And I have no regrets and I’m so thankful for this chance. And I know that what I will do moving forward is share my advice of what I know with Mr. Trump and the team if they want it. I will still chair the New Hampshire delegation to the RNC convention next month. And I can tell you that me and every person I know will continue to vote for and support Donald Trump. BASH: You’re such a good soldier. LEWANDOWSKI: In any way possible. BASH: You’re such a good soldier, and your loyalty here is exactly why    one of the main reasons why Mr. Trump kept you on for so long. LEWANDOWSKI: It’s not just loyalty. BASH: And belief in him. LEWANDOWSKI: It’s a true difference. BASH: And belief in him. I get that. But I guess my question is, somebody tuning in to watch this might be thinking that they’re, you know, on another planet because you’re making it seem like everything was really great, and I get that that’s your, you know, your instinct because you’ve been so loyal to him. But it just doesn’t make sense in a logical way, if things were that great, why you would not still be over at Trump Tower. LEWANDOWSKI: Look, the campaign is moving in the right direction. That’s the most important thing. And building out that campaign is something that’s very important to do. And I can tell you, again, I’ll give any advice I can to the campaign, but at the end of the day, voters are going to have to make a choice. They’re going to choose Hillary Clinton or they’re going to choose Donald Trump. BASH: Two more questions. LEWANDOWSKI: And they’ve got to choose Trump if they want to save our country. BASH: OK, two more questions. We were talking about structure, but you were also in charge of communications. When Mr. Trump said this is the speech I’m going to give after Orlando, and he was doubling down on the Muslim ban, and he ended up delivering a speech that was, by Republicans, almost universally thought what was that? And panned. How involved were you and were you encouraging him to do that? LEWANDOWSKI: I don’t think that’s true. I think what he has said, and has been given a lot of credit for, stepping up and making a speech immediately after the terrorist attack and calling it what it was, which is radical Islamic terrorism. And you know what? BASH: That’s not what I’m talking about. LEWANDOWSKI: People don’t want    (CROSSTALK) BASH: I’m talking about the policy prescription. LEWANDOWSKI: I understand. Look. BASH: But did you encourage him to do that? Did you say this is right on? LEWANDOWSKI: I think we have a problem in the country. And it’s very clear. BASH: You’re not going to answer my question. LEWANDOWSKI: No, we have a problem and he’s the only one who’s going to point it out. Whether it’s political correctness, it’s a problem. Not turning people in because they’re afraid of that they’re going to be accused of being racially profiling. We saw this in San Bernardino and the attacks where the neighbors knew the people were making bombs on their    in their home, but refused to turn them in because they were afraid they were going to be called racial profiling. We have to get away from this. We have to save our country. We have to save our people. If that means turning someone, whether    regardless of who they are    BASH: So you think that his po1icy and rhetorical response to Orlando was right? If you were to rewind and you had a time machine, you could do it all over again, would you do it the same way? LEWANDOWSKI: Here’s what I think. I think our immigration policies are a disaster, right? What we know is that we can’t even vet people coming into this country whether they’re Syrian refugees or they’re people coming in from any other country. We can’t even do a simple background check. What we know is that the San Bernardino killer came in on a   visa. She was married to an American citizen. But the State Department said we can’t go and look at your Facebook and social media accounts to determine if you have any jihad terrorist in you. There’s something fundamentally wrong with our government that can’t do that to protect our own citizens. And I think we need to have a better system in place, and I think what Donald Trump has said is he will fix that system on day one of him becoming the next President of the United States. BASH: Can you take me behind the scenes also on the comments he made about the judge? You were on the plane. Did you say to him, you know what, Mr. Trump, you might not want to go that far. And you might not want to say those things about something that is so explosive. Or did you say, right on? LEWANDOWSKI: No, no. It’s not a binary decision. What it comes down to very clearly is you have a judge in San Diego who has ruled against him on summary judgment, which the case should have been dismissed on. He allowed the lead plaintiff in this case to get out of the case and continue the case, right? Here’s been time and time and time again, Mr. Trump has over 10, 000 people who have provided evaluations saying that this is a great institution. He went out and found scholars from the best institutions to put the courses together. BASH: So it sounds like you said right on LEWANDOWSKI: And the judge refuses to make rulings which are fair and equitable. And that’s what we’re calling into question, is the fairness of this. And so when you have the lead plaintiff asked to be removed from the case, when you have over 10, 000 respondents, 98 percent of the people who took the courses responded favorably, whether on video or in written evaluation or in some cases both, including some of the plaintiffs in this case, right? What these people want is they want to go after Mr. Trump because they see deep pockets. And the judge should have ruled on summary judgment this case be dismissed. BASH: That’s not about the judge. LEWANDOWSKI: He’s calling into question    he’s calling into question his ability to give a fair and honest assessment of the evidence which is presented to him, and I think that’s OK to do. BASH: So you were    did anybody come out and say, you know what    did anybody have a conversation as part of a campaign meeting or anything of that sort saying, you know what, this is probably something he should pull back on? And you said, no, no, no. Right on. Go for it? LEWANDOWSKI: No, it wasn’t a conversation like that. You know, everyone has their opportunity to weigh in on issues and that could be, you know, what we like to call surround sound advocacy. Right? Everyone has the opportunity to sit down and have that conversation. At the end of the day, Mr. Trump has the final decision. BASH: You know why I’m asking you these questions, because I’m trying to get some specifics about, you know, kind of the    one of the raps on you is that you fed his worst instincts. LEWANDOWSKI: Look, I think if that’s the rap that they want to tell me, or put on me, I think what’s fair to say is anybody who knows me and has known me over a long period of time knows that I’m a very straight shooter. Much to my own detriment on many occasions. I tell people the way it is whether it’s good or bad or indifferent, because I always say I’m not smart enough to lie, because I can’t remember the lie I told. So what I say is I give you my best opinion, my best recommendation. That’s my duty and my obligation to anybody I work for, whether it’s Mr. Trump or a different company. All I can do is give my best advice and counsel. Doesn’t mean it’s right. Doesn’t mean it’s wrong. But I’m going to give you my best advice, and if my best advice is something you agree with, great. If you disagree, that’s OK too. And we’ve had many conversations where Mr. Trump and I have either agreed or disagreed, but at the end of the day I don’t take it personally. I just give my best advice and that’s the job of any good staffer. BASH: What’s your biggest regret? LEWANDOWSKI: On this campaign? None professionally. BASH: None? LEWANDOWSKI: My biggest regret    BASH: That’s not even    that’s    I mean, I know that you’re human. There’s flesh and blood. You’ve got to have some regrets. LEWANDOWSKI: My biggest regret on the campaign is not being able to have my family more involved. You know, my family lives in New Hampshire. I’ve got four young children. You know, it’s tough on them because they’re 5 and 7 and 9 years old. They’re great ages and they still want me to be around, which is fun. Campaigns are so   consuming; they’re so time consuming. It’s difficult to go home and explain what your day was like. That’s not a regret at all. I have no regrets as it comes to this campaign. I’ve been given such an opportunity and a privilege. And if somebody would’ve said to me 18 months ago, you’ll be managing the candidate through 37 state victories, 14 million votes, more votes than anyone in the history of the Republican Party, I would say, is that possible? And look what he’s been able to achieve, and I’ve been a small part of that. So I have no regrets at all. BASH: And you’re still going to be involved in that you are still the head of the New Hampshire delegation. You will be leading the New Hampshire delegation on the floor of the convention. LEWANDOWSKI: And I will make sure that every delegate there is voting for Donald Trump and every person I know is going to vote Donald Trump come this November. BASH: Corey, thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. LEWANDOWSKI: Thank you. BASH: Thank you for your time. LEWANDOWSKI: Thanks."
"       Donald Trump has, through the course of his presidential campaign, turned press conference into a sort of performance art. On Friday, he turned in another classic    a   seat of your pants thrill ride that stood in stark contrast to the more   and formal acceptance speech he gave on Thursday night in Cleveland. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  TRUMP: Thank you very much. We had an amazing convention. That was one of the best. I think it was one of the best ever. In terms    in terms of enthusiasm, in terms of I think what it represents, getting our word out. Ivanka was incredible last night. She did an incredible job. (APPLAUSE) And so many of the speakers were so amazing and  . I mean, really  . We were    it was just something very, very special. We’re even getting good marks on television. Can you believe this? (APPLAUSE) Hard to believe. Oh, they’ll change. Don’t worry. (LAUGHTER) But it has been    it has been just an incredible four days. I want to thank the people of Cleveland and the people of Ohio. (APPLAUSE) Because it’s    I mean, what    what they’ve done. You know, we read two, three weeks ago, ”this is going to be horrible; we’re going to have riots; we’re going to have problems.” Everything was a problem, a problem. This was probably one of the most peaceful, one of the most beautiful, one of the most   conventions in the history of conventions. (APPLAUSE) And when they talk about unity, I want to tell you, that was unity. That was unity. Right? I saw you last night. That was unity. That was amazing. And the party has just come together. The party has come together. And the few people that aren’t there, it’s OK. You know. You’ve got to understand. I ran as an outsider. I didn’t want anybody. Now, I have guys like Mike Pence. I mean, this isn’t supposed to happen. (APPLAUSE) See, now if I don’t win, I’m going to blame Mike, right? We have to blame Mike. (LAUGHTER) But we want to thank a number of people because, in particular, and we’re going to leave out some because that always happens and it’s very sad. The set    I’m a real estate guy    I build buildings. I build things. I want to tell you, that was the most beautiful set I think I’ve ever seen, not only for conventions, but for anything. (APPLAUSE) And the folks that worked on that, especially the carpenters, the electricians. You know, we forget about    we forget about this stuff. Those   were up there. They did a heck of a job. I said, ”You’re going to wrap that sheet rock?” And he said, ”Yeah, Mr. Trump, we just cut it.” I said, ”I know what you do, but you don’t see it very much.” We have our chairman from New York I see right over there    my man, my leader. Right? We’re going to win New York. We’re going to try and win New York. (APPLAUSE) You know, if we win New York, it’s over. Right? It’s over. Thank you, Chairman. I really appreciate it. TRUMP: So, a few of the people. Harold Hamm is here. Where is Harold? He’s around here    look at Harold here. Oh, boy. You talk about money. Oy, yoy, yoy. You know, Barry Switzer, the great football coach, won a Super Bowl, won a national championship. And I guess he’s Harold’s best friend, or one of them. So he came up to my office and he’s sitting there and says, ”You know Mr. Trump, Harold is one of the great energy tycoons, but more importantly from our standpoint, one of the people that really understands energy better than anybody else.” You know we hired these consultants, they don’t know what they’re doing. If they were any good, they’d be worth $10 billion, OK? But Harold is one of the really knowledgeable people in energy. And Barry Switzer    and he’s a tough cookie and a good guy, but a tough cookie. He said, ”You know Mr. Trump, that Harold Hamm, he’s my friend, but these other companies they go out and they spend millions of dollars looking for oil. That guy takes a straw, puts in the ground and oil pours out of it.” That’s the kind of a guy we want telling us about energy, right? (APPLAUSE) Harold, and you made a great speech the other night, great to have you. We want the real players right? We don’t want the consultants, we don’t want the guys that he hires, we want him. So, Harold, great that you’re here, I didn’t know you’d be here. I appreciate it. And your speech was terrific, by the way. We also have, and I think very important, Jeff Sessions, who may or may not be here, still but I want to tell you he was the first one. (APPLAUSE) Mike, he was right at the beginning. And he’s so highly respected and honestly Ted Cruz has so much respect for Jeff Sessions, and everybody knew that Jeff Sessions was going to be with Ted Cruz during the campaign. And Jeff said, ”You know, I’ve never seen anything like what’s happening. You’ve got a movement going on.” And he was really the first big, big player    U. S. senator, highly respected by everybody, one of the really smart people and low key. I like that, everyone once and a while, you know that low key genius. (LAUGHTER) ”Well, Donald, I don’t know if I’d do it that way, why don’t you try doing it this way?” I say that’s genius. (LAUGHTER) Every once and a while we have people like that right? But Jeff Sessions was there right at the beginning, and it was a huge upset, because when Jeff came on, everybody thought he was going to just routinely be with Ted. And frankly he’s never endorsed anybody before. You know, he’s not an endorser. This is    he’s called a tough endorsement. And he went out and he endorsed me, and that was a fantastic thing. And he’s been a great help ever since. So Jeff Sessions, I appreciate it. (APPLAUSE) Jeff Larson’s around here someplace    where’s Jeff Larson? He’s around here someplace. What a job Jeff did. Reince, of course, where’s my superstar? (APPLAUSE) I think he’s probably on a plane flying to our next meeting. This guy works so hard. You know I said yesterday in front of a small group, because we’re raising money like it’s crazy what’s going on    and you know the nice thing? First of all, I put in over $60 million. Last month, I think I put in $3. 8 million. But we’re raising money also for the Republican Party, which is very important. (APPLAUSE) And    and the beautiful thing    I can’t guarantee these figures, but I heard yesterday alone was like $3. 5 million from small donors. The average donation was just over $50. And we’re raising tremendous amount of money from the small donors. To me, that’s more important in a sense. I mean Harold can write his checks but Harold’s only one vote, right? These other people give you $50, but they vote by the millions, that’s what we want. To hell with Harold, right? (APPLAUSE) But    but we have, you know, just tremendous numbers of people coming in, and we’re really building up a war chest that’s going to be great. And I’m continuing to fund my campaign, large portions of it. And in fact, I thought I gave $2 million last month, and they said ”No, you actually gave $3. 8.” I said ”Oh.” It’s always good when you don’t even know what you gave, and it doesn’t matter. (LAUGHTER) You know it’s nice when they say you gave $3. 8 instead of two, and I don’t even get angry at anybody, right? (LAUGHTER) But I’m over $60 million, because I said I was going to fund the primaries. And I didn’t know this was going to happen, so I guess we just keep going along, right? But I’ll tell you, it’s an honor, it’s an honor. And I    and I’ve said this, a lot of the television people have come up to me, and a lot of the    actually, one very highly respected writer called up and I’ve told this story a few times, but I said    he said, ”What you’ve done is incredible.” And this was actually in September. They called it the ”summer of Trump.” And he said, ”What you’ve done is incredible.” I said ”Nothing’s incredible unless I win.” And I wasn’t talking about the primaries. He said ”No, no, no. what you’ve done is incredible. It’s been the summer of Trump, it’s down in the history books, there’s never been anything like it.” Bill O’Reilly said it’s the greatest single political phenomena he’s ever seen in his life. A couple of weeks ago, did you see that? (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Yeah. And Brit Hume said it, and I’m not so sure if Brit Hume likes me, but he said it. So    but I like him. So what happened is they said that. I said no, no, no, you don’t understand. I don’t care. I don’t do anything unless I win, and I’m not talking about the primaries. I mean, the whole thing    because otherwise, what have we done? What have we done? Then I got a call from somebody else a month ago saying the same thing. But now, it was the summer of Trump. It was the autumn of Trump. It was the Christmas of Trump. It was everything. And it’s really of you because it’s a movement. What we have going is a movement. I was just on the cover of Time again this week. Time Magazine’s like, eh, OK. (LAUGHTER) You know, I think I was on the cover of Time Magazine twice in my life and like six times in the last number of months. So you tell me, which is more important, real estate or politic, OK? That’s    that’s the way    is that true, Harold? Because I have six for politics and I have two for real estate or whatever they put me on for. But it’s been    it’s been amazing. But I said, look, it really to me matters. They said no, no, no, believe me, what you’ve done is in the history books. There’s never been anything like it. Then I won the primaries. They said the same thing. This is crazy, now you’re really in the history    I said no, it doesn’t matter. unless we beat Hillary Clinton, and I mean beat her badly. (APPLAUSE) I will consider it    and I shouldn’t say this, because you know what? If it doesn’t work out, I could say, well, I did a good job. So I’m hurting myself by saying this. If I don’t win, meaning that final stage, beat 17 people    because actually 17 including, but it was actually 17 because there was one that we don’t even talk about who joined who left very quickly. One statement, he was gone, OK? (LAUGHTER) And then don’t forget Hillary had a couple of guys who dropped out and Bernie was tough, Bernie was tough. We’re going to get a lot of the Bernie voters, by the way. (APPLAUSE) Because they didn’t treat Bernie right. They didn’t treat him right. I mean, I don’t know Bernie. I don’t    you know, I don’t know him, I’ve never met him. But they didn’t treat him right, honestly. And what happened    he ran a very, very good campaign. And Hillary’s people just swamped him. You’re looking at Debra Wasserman Schultz. I’ll take (inaudible) Reince over her any day in terms of competence. Forget it. (APPLAUSE) Not for being nice or any of those things. Who cares? I will take Reince in terms of competence over her    believe me    any day. Any day. You see what she’s done to that party. So I will tell you that I think we’re going to get a lot of his voters because of the trade issue. Because they understand, but because of the trade issue. I think we’re going to get a lot of their voters. So I have to thank Reince. I want to thank Steve King. Where’s Steve King? That’s our local    where’s Steve? Where? Thank you, Steve. I want to thank some of our security guys. First of all, the Secret Service is unbelievable. Unbelievable. (APPLAUSE) They’ve been hit a little bit over the last couple of years. Let me tell you, these guys are fantastic. I’m the best thing that ever happened to the Secret Service. (LAUGHTER) Because I go around, Mark and all these guys, I go around saying how great they are. They are great. These are great, great people, OK? (APPLAUSE) So I want to thank the Secret Service. I want to thank the police of Cleveland, the Cleveland Police Department. The mayor, I want to thank. I want to thank your police chief. He is amazing. I don’t know if he’s here. But boy, he has done some job working    working with all of the folks from law enforcement. And you heard last night, we’re going to be protecting the law enforcement. They are doing some job. So we’re going to be protecting them. I want to thank Eddie Dick (ph). Where’s Eddie? Is Eddied here? I want to thank Kevin Schroeder (ph) Keith Schiller. Become famous. He’s becoming more famous than me. I have to thank    and again, your police chief has done a fantastic job in Cleveland, done a fantastic    and we have (inaudible). (APPLAUSE) In terms of some of the folks, David Gilbert. Where’s David? David around some place? Joe Roman (ph) Chris Conner (ph) Chris Kelly. These people are all here. Don’t bother, you don’t have to come up and speak. (LAUGHTER) Beth Mooney (ph). Where’s Brian Jack? Brian Jack. Boy, Brian. Brian. What a job you did, Brian. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: OK. That’s all. Now, you can leave, go to the next location, Brian. (APPLAUSE) Go to the next location. Hillary’s trying the to pick her vice president as fast as possible, because she wants to take away a little of the success that we had at this convention. This convention has been a success. You know, people, if you turn on television, you turn on some of the dishonest media, you’ll see that oh, wow, this happened and that happened. What happened? You know, somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people. (APPLAUSE) There wasn’t one person in the room    not one. And then they said, ”There may not be unity.” Unity? There wasn’t one person in the room who was    including the Texas delegation, right? Honestly, he may have ruined his political career. I feel so badly. I feel so badly. (APPLAUSE) And, you know, he’ll come and endorse over the next little while, he’ll come and endorse, because he has no choice. But I don’t want his endorsement. What difference does it make? I don’t want his endorsement. I have such great endorse    I don’t want his endorsement. Just    Ted, stay home, relax, enjoy yourself. (LAUGHTER) Just a couple of things. I knew his speech, they gave me his speech, I saw exactly what his speech was, because when you go up to speak, you have to give your speech, you know? We don’t want surprises, right? So they gave it. They came to me and said ”It’s a boring speech, Mr. Trump. Nothing good, nothing bad. He congratulates you on the victory, and here’s the speech.” Well, he got up, and of the first two sentences, he added a sentence. In other words, he got up and he added a sentence, which could have been viewed as a nasty thing in terms of what he said, because he was implying something which is wrong, but that’s OK. So he took his speech    and you’re bound by the speech, just like you’re bound by the pledge, right? (APPLAUSE) You’re bound by the pledge. So Ted Cruz took his speech that was done, was on the teleprompter, said hello, then made a statement that wasn’t on the speech, and then went back to his speech. See, to me, that’s dishonorable. To me, not signing a pledge is dishonorable. OK? It’s dishonorable, but not a nice thing to do. And I talk this way, because we’re all together. We created one of the most successful conventions in the history of conventions. (APPLAUSE) And the television ratings for this convention were through the roof. I get a kick out of CNN. ”I don’t know if this is a successful convention. I don’t know.” In the meantime, all they talk about is Trump and the convention, are right? And I have to tell you, Melania did a great job. What a great speech. What a great speech. (APPLAUSE) What a great speech. And the presentation is still being talked about. What a beautiful speech. Ivanka last night, unbelievable, unbelievable. (APPLAUSE) Unbelievable, to have that kind of an introduction. And Tiffany, who’s never done it, the biggest group she’s ever been in front of is probably 22 people in a classroom. (LAUGHTER) Tiffany was amazing. And Eric and Don. (APPLAUSE) I just don’t want them running for political office, because somebody’s got to stay behind and run the business. I mean, you know, we can’t go crazy. (LAUGHTER) But I get a kick, because the ratings on television are through the roof. And nobody’s going to watch    look, I’ll    this has nothing to do with politics, but maybe it has a little to do. Nobody’s going to watch this next convention coming. Who the    who’s going to    I’m going to have a hard time watching her final speech. Number one, I know her too well. Number two, boring, it’s boring. (LAUGHTER) Very boring. Oh, how about that final speech? And our final speech, our final speech. (APPLAUSE) Now, it wasn’t my fault, but I think it went like an hour and 25 minutes, and the networks didn’t know what to do, because they had all of their programming, big programming    the local news is a very big factor on television. You never, ever move your local news. They all moved it. (LAUGHTER) They said, the heck with the local news, Mike, they said we’re moving it. And Kimmel and Fallon and the shows, they all went back a long way, because they weren’t going to miss this convention. I love that, you know? I love it. I knew I said, oh, wow, I’m supposed to be off. Let’s keep going, but it wasn’t my fault. (LAUGHTER) What happened    what happened was the applause was so long and so crazy. (APPLAUSE) It really was. I mean, if you look, the speech was fine, but the applause were longer than the speech. TRUMP: So it was    it was amazing. There was great love in that room. Honestly, that was all about unity. And we may be missing a couple of people. We may be missing just a couple of people. Two other things, two other things, just to finish with Ted. Because I like Ted. He’s fine. Again, I don’t want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it. Just so you understand. If he gives it, I will    I will not accept. It won’t matter. Honestly, he should have done it because nobody cares. And he would have been in better shape for four years from now if he’s going to    I don’t think    I don’t see him winning anyway, frankly. But if he did, it’s fine. Although maybe I’ll set up a   if he decides to run. (APPLAUSE) Are you allowed to set up a   Mike, if you are the president, to fight somebody? But    but there were two things that he said yesterday were lies. Ready? I didn’t start anything with the wife. A PAC, which he’s very friendly with, released a cover story on my wife, who was a tremendously successful and elegant model. And she was on the cover of GQ magazine. I think it was GQ, right? GQ magazine is not exactly Penthouse. But she was on the cover of GQ magazine, an artsy picture. But you know, she was a model, really successful. She didn’t need to marry me. She was making a lot of money, believe me. (LAUGHTER) In fact, I had to work hard to get her to marry me. It wasn’t that easy. (LAUGHTER) It’s true. (APPLAUSE) It’s so true. You think I’m kidding. So    so they released this picture which was, you know, to the people of the state of Utah. I love Utah. I love the people of Utah. But that’s not where you want to necessarily send a risque picture. Everybody in Utah got a picture. And I don’t think they showed that it was GQ. I don’t even think they showed. They took the GQ off. They just had    they cut all the stuff out so they didn’t see it was a magazine cover from, you know, a reasonably respected magazine. And it was Melania Trump. Now, and I’m saying this just to clear it up, because that’s a    ”he took (inaudible).” I didn’t do anything. Then when I saw somebody tweeted a picture of Melania, and a picture of Heidi, who I think, by the way, is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman. I have to tell you, I think Heidi Cruz is a great person. I think it’s the best thing he’d got going, and his kids, if you want to know the truth. (APPLAUSE) In a certain way, although he’s got good intellect, but he doesn’t know how to use it. And he was a good debater, but he didn’t do well in the debates against me, according to every poll. I mean, every poll, you know, he’s this great debater, except he lost in every single poll and every single debate. So that takes care of the Heidi thing. Because Heidi’s a terrific woman, but they sent out    now, he said, ”That was a PAC; we had nothing to do.” Folks, a lot of us are political people, right? We’re not babies. His people were on the PAC. So he said, ”We had nothing to do; we had. ..” Now, probably you could trace it down with   but they’re pretty smart. They don’t even send    probably just phone calls. But look, it was a PAC with many of his friends. It was a Cruz  . I think he even said, ”Well, it wasn’t really meant for us.” It was a Cruz PAC. It was his people. OK, so they sent out the first picture. Please remember that. Number two, his father. I don’t know his father. I met him once. I think he’s a lovely guy. I think he’s a lovely guy. All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead, he said, ”Donald Trump”    I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that, frankly, in many respects, should be very respected. They got O. J. They got Edwards. I mean, if that was the New York Times, they would have gotten Pulitzer Prizes for their reporting. I’ve always said, why didn’t the National Enquirer get the Pulitzer Prize for Edwards and O. J. Simpson and all of these things? But anyway, so they have a picture, an old picture, having breakfast with Lee Harvey Oswald. Now, nothing    I’m not saying anything. They said    and here’s how the press takes that story. So this had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out, but it had nothing to do with me. I have no control over anything. I might have pointed it out. But they never denied. Did anybody ever deny that it was the father? They’re not saying, ”Oh, that wasn’t really my father.” It’s a little hard to do, because it looks like him. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: So, here’s the story. The press takes that, and they say, ”Donald Trump and his conspiracy theories; he went out and said his father was with Lee Harvey Oswald, and he assassinated the president.” What did I do? So two things. Those were the two points. So in those two points, he said about the endorsement    and I just had it cleared up. I think I’m doing the right thing in doing it, but I have to do it. Number one, the Heidi thing you understand now. Number two, I know nothing about his father. I know nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald. But there was a picture on the front page of the National Inquirer, which does have credibility, and they’re not going to do pictures like that because they get sued for a lot of money if things are wrong, OK, a lot of money. And there was a picture. And that’s the only thing I know. So now, they use the two things as the reason he won’t support. Let me tell you something. We, if for no other reason, if people really dislike me, and I don’t think they do any more after the four days. Hey look, if I have kids that like me that much, how bad can I be, right, right? (LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) And they love their daddy. I was a good father. But I have smart children and good children. And I’m getting a lot of credit. I think they were the star of the convention. Mike, I think they saved us. I think they saved us, Mike. But no, my children were really    and they’re saying, people are saying that, they were the star    the real stars of the convention. Everyone of them    they were    I was so proud of them. I mean, it was such a great thing. But to finish, this was an amazing period of time. This was an amazing convention. I just heard a number    is Dan Scavino there? Come up, Dan, for a second. I just    Dan Scavino. You might have seen him on Twitter and Facebook. You know what he is? He’s a Facebook, Twitter junky. This guy    that was the first time I’ve seen him look up in seven months. He’s always looking down. (LAUGHTER) Nobody knows Facebook and Twitter and that stuff better than Dan. Why don’t you give just a quick report because I hear the numbers are astronomical. Where do you hear these    you know, we’re dealing in a modern age. I hate to do this. A lot of people saying what’s Facebook, what’s    unfortunately, we’re dealing in a modern age. How about giving a quick    you want to hear this? Wait until you hear the numbers. You won’t even believe them. Go ahead. SCAVINO: Thank you, President Trump. This    this is. .. (APPLAUSE) I’ve got to    I have to tell you, #trumptrain. Is everybody out there? The Trump train is all here, right? (APPLAUSE) This is surreal for everybody that’s part of the campaign. Twitter last night exploded. Facebook exploded. Instagram exploded. Did everybody see the videos on Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, Instagram account, Facebook account? I mean, tens of millions of views. We had over 85 million views on just those videos in a four to   period, all right? Almost half a million new followers on Facebook. Mr. Trump hit 10 million followers on Twitter. TRUMP: Ten million. (APPLAUSE) SCAVINO: This    this will never be done again. It’s impossible to be done again with this man right here. It’s absolutely impossible with his platforms. A total of 22. 5 million followers between Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, 22. 5 million. (APPLAUSE) I don’t know how you do this every day. This is insane. Impressions on Twitter per month, over one billion impressions on Twitter. (APPLAUSE) And similar, the numbers are going to come out for Facebook, they’re going to be probably in the billions. It’s absolutely unheard of. So when Mr. Trump wants to get a message out, we get those videos out and things aren’t necessarily working out with CNN or somebody, we can put it on his platform and get more views just on one of those social media accounts that Mr. Trump has, which is @realDonaldtrump on Twitter, Donald J. Trump on Facebook, RealDonaldTrump on Instagram. And our next vice president of the United States is @mike_pence, OK? So please follow him as well. He has a governor account, but he’s still the governor of Indiana so let’s just try and follow him there, all right, give him some engagements. We’re going to be pushing out a lot of messages for the campaign. There’s a lot of people behind me. It’s not only me; Brad Parscale, Justin McConney. This is    there’s a whole team. So we    we love you. This is absolutely awesome to come out and talk to the #trumptrain. Let’s make America great again. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So one of my really good choices in life, although I’ll confirm that in about three and a half months from now, but I believe truly it will be one of my really great decisions is picking Mike Pence to run along with me and to run for you (ph). And so I’d like to ask Governor Pence from the great state of Indiana, and we love Indiana and Bobby Knight, who I love and Lou Holtz and you’re wonderful    you know, Gene from Purdue    we have them all    and Digger. We’ve got a lot of coaches out there. But these guys are great people and they love Mike and maybe Mike can say a few words. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) PENCE: We are so humbled and so grateful. Grateful to all of you, the volunteers, the people wearing the blue shirts, the people that brought about the most exciting political convention of my entire lifetime. Thank you for your extraordinary work, your tireless hours. To all of those that did the work, that did the setup, that are doing the tear down now, thank you so much. Thank you so much for creating a place where we could celebrate the kind of leadership that America is embracing more and more every hour as we move toward the November election. But I just    I just wanted to express a word of appreciation to all of you. All of you who came here, all of you who came alongside this good man and his family from early on in this campaign. We’re    we’re so excited to be a part of this team. My wonderful wife, Karen Pence, is with us today and we are hitting the campaign trail together. (APPLAUSE) And I can just tell you    I can just tell you having spent time with this man and his family, having seen his ability to connect and speak for the American people, I say with absolute confidence if we work with all of our hearts for every day between now and election day, we will make Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States of America and we will make America great again. Thank you and God bless you and let’s go get it done. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Thank you. Just one thing I wanted to leave you with: Supreme Court justices. (APPLAUSE) No matter how much you like or dislike, no matter what your feelings, whether you’re the governor of Ohio, whether you’re a senator from Texas or any of the other people that I beat so easily and so badly, you have no choice, you’ve got to go for Trump. Supreme Court justices. If Hillary Clinton gets it, she is going to replace    and last night I called him our beloved Justice Scalia, he was great. (APPLAUSE) And we’re going to get somebody as close to him and his views and philosophy as possible. Conservative, all the things you want, the things we stand for as a party. And I promise you that, and that’s why I issued 11 names because being an outsider, they said oh, well we don’t know, supposing you put up liberal judges. I say I have an idea, it’s never been done before, you know we have a lot of ideas that people don’t normally have, right? I said I have an idea. In order to    because I really just have no problem. They didn’t know if they believed me, well we don’t know what happens if we elect him and then he puts up liberal judges. By the way, our conservative Republican presidents haven’t done so well with the judges, have they? OK. I mean, we have Obamacare, should have been knocked out twice because of an appointment. (APPLAUSE) So we’ll do better, we’ll do much better. That’s why I put out a list of 11 judges. But no matter what you think of Donald Trump, as a Republican, if that’s what your philosophy is, if you’re a great, great believer in the Constitution, you have no choice. Hate to say it. Whether you’re a hater or a lover, and by the way, last night I don’t think there was one hater in that room. And that was packed. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: That was packed. There were no seats and those seats were selling for a lot of money on eBay. They were going for big numbers. In fact, I was thinking about taking 10 or 12 tickets and saying, ”Let’s go.” But they were selling for a lot of money. And it was amazing. So, just remember, Supreme Court justices. I want to finish by this    we’ve had some incredible support, because when I started everyone said, you know, some of these pundits that now say, ”Oh, well, you can’t do that, you can’t”    these were the same people that say, ”well, if he runs    but he won’t run.” I ran. Then they said, ”Oh,” then they go, ”But he won’t win.” Then I started off at 6 percent, which is pretty high because I was only there about two days. People forgot. So that was only two days, I didn’t get the full backing. Then it went to like 12, and then to 18. And every week they said, ”Well, that’s his ceiling. And he can’t do more than that.” So we go from six    right? These    I saw them in the audience, those two. So we go from six, to 12 to 18 and every week they go, ”Well, that’s the ceiling.” Charles Krauthammer, ”They will not run, he will not run. And if he runs, he will just be doing it for fun.” This is not fun. This is a lot of work. OK. This is a lot of work, folks. I didn’t need this. This wasn’t in exactly the schedule. But I saw how badly our country is doing and how easy it will be to bring back. Trade deals alone will make an impact like you won’t believe. Money will come in. Jobs will come in. And then you look at the military where it’s so depleted, but we’re taking care of other nations. And I want to continue to take care of other nations, there are a lot of good things about that, but they have to pay us. They have to pay us. (APPLAUSE) You know, I remember years ago, and I’ve always said, ”Wow, I never quite understood it, ” because they said, ”The United States spends ten times the money on its military than anybody else in the world.” I said    I said, ”Well, China has a big military, all these places. That’s surprising.” But, you know, I was building buildings and things, I never really gave it too much thought. And then I realized, I remember    I always remember, we spend so much more than anybody else. I said, how can that be? We’re protecting everybody in the world. I mean, we’re protecting all these nations, and these are rich nations and they’re great nations. Japan, they send their cars, they make a fortune, and then they don’t pay us the amount that it costs. I don’t want to make a profit. I want costs, pay us what it costs. Maybe we can’t get it. And if we can’t    see, you have to be prepared to walk. You have to. If you’re not prepared to walk. Hillary Clinton came out when she heard what I said about Japan. Japan is a very rich nation. Those cars are flowing in. They’re rich because of us, if you think about it. OK. Those cars    you go to Los Angeles, you see these massive ships. It looks like NASCAR. By the way, thank you Brian France, owner of NASCAR. He endorsed Donald Trump. I love NASCAR! Richard Petty endorsed me. All    a lot of the great drivers endorsed me. King Richard. But they    it’s like    it’s like these guys driving    it’s like Richard Petty driving    they’re coming out of the boats, these massive ships. And they don’t pay us. And then the general gets up and the general says, ”Mr. Trump is wrong, doesn’t he understand that Japan pays us 50 percent of the cost of defending them?” Oh, great. They say, ”Mr. Trump, could we have a comment?” I said, ”Yeah, why aren’t they paying 100 percent,” Right? And Germany and South Korea, we have 28, 000 soldiers. And think of this one, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia wouldn’t be there for one week if we pulled out. They have nothing but money. Nothing but money. They have so much money, they    they don’t know what to do with it, OK. They don’t know what to do with it. Who’s    who is making our deals for us? One deal like that has a massive impact on our budgets, on our economics as a country. We’re up to $19 trillion. We’re very soon going to be $21 trillion. Trillion. Nobody even knows what    if I could take    I could take the great Harold Hamm, I could say, ”Tell me what a trillion dollars is?” Although, he’s worth almost a trillion, so he may know. He may know. (LAUGHTER) But, you know, honestly, most people don’t even know what the hell it    it’s so much. They even know. They wouldn’t know how to define it. So here’s the story. We are going to do something really special, and our message caught on. When I started this, we had all these pundits saying, it won’t happen. And I had a little staff    Corey Lewandowski was great. I have to tell you. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And he’s been very loyal and he’s been on CNN, and he’s really been fighting for me, which is very nice. And I    I respect that a lot. (APPLAUSE) Hope Hicks. Where’s Hope? Come here, Hope. Come here, Hope. Get up here, Hope. Hope Hicks, the legendary Hope Hicks. Come on up here, Hope. Come. Come. Come. She’s shy. Get her up here. Come on, Hope. Come on, Hope. We had a very small, but tough team. We had a small    here’s Hope Hicks. They’re not going to lift you over that barricade probably. Look at her. She’s very shy. She’s actually    she’s a very shy person, but she’s a great person. She’s done an amazing job. And we had a staff of between George    where’s our George? Come on over here. Come on. Fellows, get over here. Just stand over here someplace. Get up. Get up on the dais. Come on. I’d get Hope up, but she can’t get through the Secret Service people there. And what happened    so we had a small staff. And I got criticized for it. They’d say, ”So and so”    I won’t use names because I don’t want to embarrass anybody    ”so and so has spent many times what Trump has spent and has a much bigger staff,” and then we win. I don’t get any credit. You’re supposed to get credit if you have smaller staff, less payroll, and you win. But in politics, you don’t get credit. So anyway, so I want to thank my entire group. Then we beefed it up because we’re really now in the final stretch        months. And Paul Manafort has done an amazing job. He’s here someplace. Where’s Paul? (APPLAUSE) Paul Manafort    oh, good. You made it. Paul Manafort has done a fantastic (inaudible). And all of Paul’s people Paul brought on the staff. And we really do. We have a great staff of talented people, a great staff. And most of them are right here. And John and everybody    my man right here; and Michael. You have to be    Michael, come on up, Michael. Get up here, Michael. Come on. Get a little TV time. Look at him. (LAUGHTER) I don’t know (inaudible) hired for Hollywood. I tend to doubt it, but you never know. Come on up, Rick. So we have a great group of people. And we have a group of people that really wants to win, and I think knows how to win. And we’ve all sort of been winning all our lives. This group of people in front of me, I know so many of you, we’ve been winning all our lives. We’ve got exactly three months and three weeks. I am going to be working so hard. I’m not going to, like last time where they disappeared for the last    . What happened? Where is everybody? What happened? And give Obama credit. He was on every television show. He was all over the place. We’re not going to disappear. So we have a really great chance of taking our country back, of change, and of getting great Supreme Court justices. (APPLAUSE) So, I want to thank everybody. I love you folks. This has been such an incredible movement. I love you. I know so many of you. We’re going to go all the way. And I’ll tell you what, when we get there, we will indeed make America great again. I love you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.           Jabin   Washington Post  "
"      Where all that Olympic money goes View Graphic        Its members call it, with an almost religious conviction, “the Olympic Movement,” or “the Movement” for short, always capitalized.  At the very top of “the Movement” sits the International Olympic Committee, a nonprofit run by a “volunteer” president who gets an annual “allowance” of $251, 000 and lives   in a   hotel and spa in Switzerland. At the very bottom of “the Movement”  —   beneath the IOC members who travel   and get paid thousands of dollars just to attend the Olympics, beneath the executives who make hundreds of thousands to organize the Games, beneath the international sports federations, the national sport federations and the national Olympic committees and all of their employees  —   are the actual athletes whose moments of triumph and pain will flicker on television screens around the globe starting next week. When hundreds of millions of people gather around televisions Friday to watch the Opening Ceremonies of the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, they will be taking part in the economic engine that powers the Olympic Movement. Broadcast and sponsorship deals for the Summer and Winter Games deliver billions to the IOC and its affiliates every year. But by the time that flood of cash flows through the Movement and reaches the athletes, barely a trickle remains, often a few thousand dollars at most. For many members of Team USA  —   many of whom live meagerly off the largesse of friends and family, charity, and public assistance  —   the biggest reward they’ll receive for making it to Rio will be two suitcases full of free Nike and Ralph Lauren clothing they are required to wear at all team events. In the words of its charter, the Olympic Movement is devoted “to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful society. ” To an increasingly vocal and active group of current and former Olympic athletes in the United States, however, the Movement is a vast, global bureaucracy that treats athletes like replaceable cogs, restricting their income without fear of reprisal from a workforce unable, or unwilling, to unionize. “The athletes are the very bottom of a   system, and there’s just not much left for us,” said Cyrus Hostetler, 29, a Team USA javelin thrower and   Olympian who said the most he’s ever made in one year in his career, after expenses, is about $3, 000. “They take care of themselves first, and us last. ”     Ronda Rousey won a bronze medal in judo at the 2008 Olympics  —   and was living out of her car two years later. (Mike   Images)     Speedskater Emily Scott needed food stamps to get by as she trained for the 2014 Winter Games. (Bernat  )    This story is based on interviews with dozens of people familiar with the Olympic Movement  —   current and former athletes, executives and lawyers who’ve represented athletes  —   and a review of hundreds of pages of financial documents from organizations including the IOC, the U. S. Olympic Committee and several U. S. sport federations. The picture that emerges is a multibillion dollar entertainment industry whose entertainers are, in this country, expected to raise their own income or live in poverty. There is no comprehensive data on U. S. Olympic athlete pay, but information collected by a nonprofit last year from 150 track and field athletes ranked in the top 10 in the country in their events found an average income of $16, 553. Even USOC officials concede that, with the exceptions of the handful of megastars such as Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte who rake in big endorsement money and those who play sports with lucrative professional leagues, most U. S. Olympic athletes cannot earn enough from their sports to make a living. The stories of U. S. Olympians persisting despite paltry pay are common. Before finding fame and fortune as a UFC fighter, Ronda Rousey won a bronze medal in judo in 2008  —   and was living out of her car a few months later. Speedskater Emily Scott said she needed food stamps to get by as she trained for the 2014 Winter Games. Hostetler, who has been one of the best American javelin throwers for the past eight years, said he’s relied on both food stamps and unemployment benefits. While many athletes struggle to pay their rent or buy groceries, the billions the Rio Games will generate will flow into the paychecks and extravagant perks enjoyed by IOC members, USOC staffers, and employees and volunteers with the hundreds of sports organizations that comprise “the Movement. ”    From left, USA Swimming team director Frank Busch; USOC CEO Scott Blackmun; USA Swimming Exectuive Director Chuck Wielgus; IOC President Thomas Bach (Associated Press and European Pressphoto Agency photos)  USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus makes $854, 000 and national swim team director Frank Busch makes $346, 000; their swimmers competing in Rio next month can make monthly stipends that cap at $42, 000 per year. USA Triathlon CEO Rob Urbach makes $362, 000 while Team USA triathletes compete for stipends that range from about $20, 000 to $40, 000 a year. The coach of the USA Rowing women’s team makes $237, 000 while his rowers vie for stipends that max out at about $20, 000 per year. “I’ve never thought it was fair,” said rower Caroline Lind, a   gold medalist who recently retired after a back injury. “We’re all replaceable . . . There’s not really a concern for the individual athletes. ” The IOC declined to make anyone available for an interview for this story. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun, in a phone interview, defended how his organization has governed the Olympic system in the United States. Unlike national Olympic committees in many other countries, Blackmun noted, the USOC receives no government support to help it pay athletes. “You have to look back at where the Olympic Movement came from. It was an   movement. Nobody got compensated,” said Blackmun, who made about $1 million in 2014, tax records show. “It’s not a   movement. Nobody in suits is getting paid for this beyond what you have to pay people to raise all the money we have to raise . . . We are in good faith trying to maximize the level of support we can provide to our athletes. I wish we had the resources to support more athletes. ” Athletes arguing for change acknowledge that, even though billions flow into the Movement, there’s not enough money generated by the Olympics for everyone to get rich. Team USA’s 555 athletes will be among more than 10, 200 competing in Rio. “There are limited resources for sure. You don’t want to take so much money away from the USOC . . . that they can’t do their jobs,” said Eli Bremer, a former Olympic modern pentathlete who competed in the 2008 Summer Games. “But you don’t want them getting fat and happy while the athletes live in poverty. I believe there is a better balance. ”    Also known as “the Olympic Capital,” Lausanne, Switzerland, offers beautiful vistas  —   and financial privacy. (Robert   Images)  They adorn themselves The IOC and dozens of international sports federations are headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland  —   also known as “the Olympic capital”  —   a city that offers beautiful mountain vistas in a country that has legally enshrined financial privacy protections. Unlike in the States, nonprofits in Switzerland are not legally required to publicly disclose information about how they spend their money. At the bottom of most IOC news releases, a note explains that the organization sends more than 90 percent of its income down into the Movement; an average of $3. 25 million, every day, “to help athletes and sports organizations at all levels around the world. ” An uncertain percentage of that money stays in Lausanne, though, or flows to organizations in other countries where nonprofits enjoy legally protected financial secrecy. Neither FINA (swimming) nor FIG (gymnastics)  —   two of the largest international federations, both based in Lausanne  —   publicly release financial information. The IAAF (track and field) headquartered in Monaco, also does not disclose financial details. “Whenever athletes complain . . . the IOC is famous for saying we give out 90 percent of our yearly revenues to support the athletes,” said Adam Nelson, an Olympic shot put thrower and gold medalist who has tried to unionize U. S. track and field athletes. “While that may be true, they just pass a lot of it out to the federations. And there’s not a lot of transparency or accountability about how that money gets spent, used, and what makes it down to the athletes,” Nelson said. Despite enjoying the same legal entitlement to secrecy, the IOC does publish occasional financial reports that include some details, such as expected annual revenue ($1. 375 billion) and payroll ($62 million). Last year, as part of a move toward more transparency, the IOC published details about the perks packages it provides President Thomas Bach and the 115 elected IOC members, all of whom are considered “volunteers. ” For Bach, a former lawyer and Olympic fencer from Germany, the IOC provides an annual “allowance” of about 225, 000 Euros ($251, 000) and pays for his suite at the Lausanne Palace & Spa, “an exceptional place of refinement” that offers “a superb view across Lake Geneva to the Alps,” according to its website. It’s unclear which type of suite Bach stays in, or whether the IOC gets a discount, but the Palace recently priced its cheapest suite at $1, 068 per night, or just shy of $390, 000 for an entire year. IOC members  —   a distinguished group that includes royalty (Prince Albert II of Monaco, Henri the Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark) and successful business executives (former Electronic Arts CEO Larry Probst)  —   also enjoy generous perks. When on IOC business, members fly   stay in luxury hotels, and also get cash per diems: $450 per day for regular IOC members, $900 per day for the IOC’s executive committee. These rates also apply to the Games themselves, which means in Rio, some IOC members will get paid more to watch the Olympics ($7, 650, depending on travel schedules) than many Team USA athletes will get paid to compete in the Olympics. (USA Track and Field provides athletes $10, 000 bonuses and USA Gymnastics awards $5, 000 bonuses for making Team USA, but most other sport federations don’t. Athlete travel, lodging and food is covered by the USOC.) Bob Balk is a former Paralympic canoe athlete who attended the 2012 London Games as an IOC volunteer and also received per diem money. In a recent phone interview, he recalled his amazement when he learned how much money he and other volunteers were getting to attend the Olympics. Every morning, Balk recalled, a crowd of IOC members and volunteers gathered in a hotel room in London to collect their daily spending money.    IOC President Thomas Bach is considered a ‘volunteer’ but receives an annual ‘allowance’ of about $247, 000. (Ivan   Images)  “They had a $100 bill counting machine, and people were standing in line to get their stacks of hundred dollar bills,” Balk said. “It was crazy. ” Balk, like other IOC members and volunteers, had his flight and hotel bills covered, a car service to get around London, and a bevy of free meals. When Balk got home, he still had $10, 000 in per diem cash, he said, which he just deposited in the bank. Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College who has researched the IOC, gave the nonprofit credit for not lavishing its top executives with massive salaries like the global soccer organization FIFA, but said that where the IOC spends excessively is on the perks. IOC members, Zimbalist said, “adorn themselves by putting themselves in suites at the best hotels whenever they travel, always traveling first class wherever they go, and basically always having meetings, and always traveling first class as they   the world going to these meetings. ”  According to the IOC, after taking its   cut for overhead, it divides the remaining 90 percent evenly among three major groups: the organizing committees for each Games, international sport federations, and then Olympic committees in each country. Among all those organizations, only one gets a contractually   percentage of the IOC’s broadcasting deal with NBC and its lucrative “The Olympic Partner,” or TOP, sponsorship program: the USOC.    Jesse Rodriguez, Shakur Stevenson and Charles Conwell work out at the U. S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. (Katherine   Washington Post)  ‘We train here’ In late May, the USOC held a media event at its Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, to show off how it helps U. S. Olympians prepare for the Rio Games. American flags hung from the rafters over an expansive weight room, and large signs in red, white and blue lined the indoor track, bearing the same message: “WE TRAIN HERE. ” With 140, 000 square feet of training space spread across 35 acres, the Colorado Springs facility is the flagship training center for Team USA. The center boasts six   sport psychologists, five   dietitians, and   facilities for shooting, gymnastics, weightlifting, cycling and swimming, among others. The media tour of the campus  —   led by Michael Cain, the center’s director of business development  —   emphasized how much the USOC provides to Olympic athletes, free of charge. “It’s important to note: No member of Team USA pays his or her own way,” Cain said. The center has   housing for about 525, Cain said, and it costs the USOC about $42, 000 per year for an athlete to stay there. For the USOC, its three training centers  —   including others in suburban San Diego and Lake Placid, N. Y.  —   are among its biggest annual expenses, costing about $28 million. There is one noteworthy fact that neither Cain nor any of the other staffers leading tours mentioned that day: Not many members of Team USA actually train there. In 2012, a study by the Athletes’ Advisory Council  —   a group of current and former athletes  —   found that just 13 percent of Olympic Training Center usage went to U. S. Olympians. The training centers’ biggest clients were aspiring Olympians and foreign athletes, many of whom pay their own way. USOC CEO Blackmun said the figure sounded accurate, and the USOC is reviewing how much it spends on its training centers. “If you look at our athletes who win medals, and their   to the Games, and where they train . . . There’s not as direct a relationship between our medals and maintenance of our training centers as you’d expect,” Blackmun said. In major American sports  —   such as the NFL, Major League Baseball, and the NBA  —   management typically shares about 50 percent of the revenue with the athletes. In promotional materials, the USOC advertises that more than 90 percent of its spending goes to “areas that support U. S. Olympic and Paralympic athletes. ” That same 2012 study by former athletes found just 6 percent of USOC spending actually goes to athletes as cash payments. “I was pretty shocked and disappointed, but I knew how the system worked,” said Ben Barger, an Olympic sailor who led the study. “The money goes to executives first, then administrators, then coaches, and then athletes. ” The reason there’s a large disparity between what the USOC says it spends on “areas that support athletes” and what the USOC actually pays athletes, Blackmun explained, is because the USOC includes the salaries of many of its employees who work with athletes or raise money for the organization in the larger figure. Since 2009, tax records show, the USOC’s payroll has expanded from $39 milllion to $49 million, and the number of USOC employees making $100, 000 or more has nearly doubled, rising from 66 to 121. The USOC’s total headcount has remained mostly stable over the time period, records show. Blackmun is just paying his employees more. That increase in payroll, Blackmun said, is largely because of new business development and fundraising staffers who more than pay for their salaries with the money they raise. Since 2009, according to USOC analysis, its fundraising has gone up nearly 200 percent, compared with a 40 percent payroll increase.    The USA Cycling women’s team pursuit training at the   Velodrome in Colorado Springs. (Casey B.   USA)  “An investment in your development program or in your sponsorship programs is an investment in athletes, because that’s what provides the resources for them,” Blackmun said. “I need the best sponsorship people and the best philanthropic people, and that’s why some of our people are getting paid at levels that I think some of our athletes are not comfortable with. ” Nick Symmonds, a   Olympic middle distance runner and an outspoken critic of the USOC and USA Track and Field, strongly disagrees with that reasoning. “It’s absolutely offensive that they think we’re stupid enough to consider that athlete support,” Symmonds said. “True athlete support is money going into athletes’ pockets. ” While USOC employees’ paychecks have grown over the years, the bonuses the USOC pays to Olympic medalists through a program called “Operation Gold” have remained stagnant since 2002: $25, 000 for gold, $15, 000 for silver, and $10, 000 for bronze. In an interview, USOC chief of sport performance Alan Ashley, who makes about $460, 000, said he believes bonuses for medalists is “paying for past performance,” and not likely to result in Team USA winning more medals. The   mission of the USOC is winning the most medals possible; when Blackmun discussed how his organization decides which sports and athletes deserve money, he used the phrase “podium potential. ” To athletes good enough to be the best in the United States at sports dominated by other countries, though, the focus on podium potential can make them feel undesired in a community they’ve effectively taken a vow of poverty to join.    Javelin thrower Cyrus Hostetler competed in London and is headed to Rio, but says, ‘If I could do it all over again, I probably wouldn’t do this.’ (Matt  )  ‘I don’t believe in you’ Cyrus Hostetler made Team USA as a javelin thrower for the 2012 London Games, and placed 32nd. As a returning Olympian, he expected the USOC or USA Track and Field would make more resources available to help him improve for Rio. He experienced something different. In late 2015, USA Track and Field Director of Sport Performance Peter “Duffy” Mahoney told Hostetler in an email that, after consulting with USOC staff, he had decided “you do not exhibit sufficient finalist or medalist potential. ” Hostetler, 29, was living in a   room at the USOC training center in California at the time, training every day with other javelin throwers. (There is no Team USA or USA Track and Field javelin coach; the throwers basically train themselves.) Mahoney  —   who makes $152, 000  —   informed Hostetler that USA Track and Field was cancelling funding for his bed, food, and treatment at the center. If Hostetler wanted to stay, he’d have to pay: $200 a month to train, $10 per meal, $43 per hour for massage therapy, and $100 per hour for medical treatment. “He basically was telling me, ‘I don’t believe in you, I don’t think you’re worth my money, so I want you to pay me instead.’ It felt like he was milking me for all I was worth,” Hostetler said in a phone interview. Angry but undeterred, Hostetler moved into cheap housing nearby provided by a former Norwegian competitor, and kept showing up at the center every day to train. He stopped eating there, or getting medical or therapeutic treatment. A few months later, Hostetler got a call from a training center employee, who told him he owed several hundred dollars for training fees. Hostetler ignored it. “I said I’m just going to wait until someone forces me to pay . . . I would have loved to have seen USA Track and Field send me to collections,” Hostetler said. At this month’s Olympic trials, Hostetler rebounded from a slow start to hurl a javelin 273 feet 1 inch, winning the national title, and a spot on Team USA. The experience with USA Track and Field has left Hostetler bitter about how his Olympic career will end. He’s a long shot to medal, but he knows even if he does, the moment will be tainted. Mahoney will “have paid me nothing, and I’ll have just won a medal he can take credit for,” Hostetler said. After the Games, Hostetler plans to take some time off, during which he’ll try to figure out what do with the rest of his life. “I could go work for USA Track and Field and do less than I do now and make more money. I could flip burgers and make more money than I do now,” Hostetler said. “If I could do it all over again, I probably wouldn’t do this. ” In an email, spokeswoman Jill Geer said USA Track and Field dropped Hostetler from its training program because he did not meet competitive standards last year. “Cyrus had a great performance at the Olympic Trials and we are pleased to have him on the team in Rio,” Geer wrote. The big event down south The last level of the Movement that separates athletes competing in the Olympics from the money companies pay to be associated with the event are the national governing bodies, or NGBs, for each Olympic sport in the United States  —   47 organizations that compete for USOC money while also trying to raise money on their own. These NGBs range from large organizations with sizeable sponsorship deals and   executives (USA Track and Field made $22 million in 2014, and paid CEO Max Siegel $1. 1 million) to small organizations in niche sports (US Rowing earned $7. 5 million in 2014; CEO Glenn Merry made $168, 000). USA Track and Field has been among the most aggressive NGBs in recent years at increasing the amount of money it pays athletes. A new system enacted last year ensures baseline pay of about $45, 000 for an athlete who wins a national title and competes on Team USA, and other performance bonuses can drive pay past $100, 000. That increase in paying athletes has come at the same time USA Track and Field has significantly increased how much it spends on its own employees. From 2008 to 2014, records show, USA Track and Field’s payroll has more than doubled, from $2. 9 million to $5. 9 million, as the organization’s workforce has grown from 47 to 70.  For CEO Siegel, 2014 was particularly lucrative   thanks to a $500, 000 bonus, his income jumped about 60 percent.  In a phone interview, Steve Miller, board chairman of USA Track and Field, said Siegel more than earned his pay by expanding the organization’s revenue, most prominently through a new sponsorship deal with Nike worth a reported $500 million that starts next year and runs through 2040. “What he has accomplished has been nothing short of incredible,” Miller said. “He could do a lot better on the open market. ” While Miller is ecstatic about that new Nike deal  —   “I think it’s spectacular,” he said  —   some runners are concerned it will make it even more difficult for track athletes to land individual endorsement deals. In 2014, a running website published an April Fool’s spoof announcing that USA Track and Field had become a division of Nike. There’s an element of truth underlining the joke. USA Track and Field draws roughly half its overall revenue every year from its current deal with Nike (worth a reported $10 million anually) and the company’s stake in USA Track and Field will only increase next year when the new deal (worth a reported $20 million annually) starts. Nike also sponsors the USOC, which means the corporate behemoth has a stranglehold on the two   events in track and field: the U. S. Olympic trials and the Olympics. Nike’s competitors must accept the fact that, if they endorse runners, they’ll be spending money on athletes who, at the U. S. Olympic trials, will be televised running around a stadium lined with Swooshes, and then at the Olympics will wear Nike jerseys as they run and, if they win medals, Nike sweatsuits on the podium. Some runners have expressed concern that Nike’s dominance is scaring away competition. “Other brands aren’t going to have exposure on the biggest stages, so why would they invest?” said Lauren Fleshman, a former Nike runner. “Even Nike athletes are going to be affected, because the marketplace is less competitive, so Nike won’t have to pay as much. ” At last month’s track and field trials in Eugene, Ore. a situation involving Fleshman’s new sponsor  —   Oiselle, a women’s athletic apparel company  —   demonstrated these concerns.    Oiselle CEO Sally Bergesen, left, said the USOC and USATF ‘say that they give athletes the opportunity to make a living through endorsements, but they also structure that opportunity in such a way that it severely devalues them.’ (Brian   Images for Nolcha Fashion Week)  Oiselle CEO Sally Bergesen attended the trials to root on 14 of her athletes, including   runner Kate Grace. When Grace pulled off a surprise win in the women’s   final, Oiselle posted celebratory notes on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The next day, Oiselle got an email from a USOC lawyer, demanding the company delete the social media posts. If Oiselle wanted to celebrate Grace’s achievement, the USOC said, the company needed to avoid a long list of trademarked words and phrases, including “Olympic,” “Team USA,” and “Road to Rio. ” Any pictures of Grace running at the trials or celebrating would have to be censored, because the Oiselle racing top she wore at the trials also had a USOC “Road to Rio” logo with the Olympic rings. Oiselle deleted the posts, and replaced them with notes that referred, vaguely, to Grace’s upcoming appearance in “the Big Event in the Southern Hemisphere. ” Photos of Grace’s winning run were   with black boxes censoring trademarked images on Grace or in the background. In an interview, Bergesen estimated that Oiselle had spent about $300, 000 endorsing Grace over the past four years, a figure that included salary, travel, and gear. In that same time period, the USOC and USA Track and Field had spent about $10, 000 on Grace, Bergesen estimated. Nike hasn’t paid Grace anything. (Grace declined an interview request, but confirmed the estimates.) The USOC and USA Track and Field “say that they give athletes the opportunity to make a living through endorsements, but they also structure that opportunity in such a way that it severely devalues them,” Bergesen said. “They’re basically saying, knock ’em dead, go get sponsors, and then they say, simultaneously, once you get to the Olympic trials and the Olympics, those sponsors you’ve gotten no longer have any visibility. ” Exclusive sponsorship deals with companies such as Nike, Blackmun said, are vital to funding the USOC. “What our sponsors are most interested in is exclusivity. . . . We generate about $100 million a year in sponsorship revenue, we wouldn’t be able to get that revenue unless we could make a promise of exclusivity,” Blackmun said. “If someone can make a credible case that our athletes who are   will receive more support under a different model . . . We would be very willing to look at that. ” Bergesen has suggested allowing Olympic athletes the right to put their individual sponsors on their race uniforms, along with the Swoosh. USA Track and Field board chairman Steve Miller believes the exclusive Nike deal will guarantee a better base salary for more track and field athletes than any alternative. “If Nike got out of track and field, I don’t know who or what would replace them and their money,” Miller said. At smaller U. S. sport federations, athletes are less concerned with the sway held by sponsors, and more bothered by the power held by coaches and executives. At US Rowing, based in Princeton, N. J. women’s head coach Tom Terhaar has major input on who makes the Olympic team and how much they get paid. Terhaar is US Rowing’s   employee, at $237, 000. Men’s coach Luke McGee makes $197, 000. Their rowers compete for stipends that range from $500 to $1, 700 per month. Caroline Lind won two gold medals for Terhaar, at the 2008 and 2012 Games. Her average annual income, Lind said, has been about $12, 000, so she’s relied on her parents for financial support. In 2015, Lind had surgery on a herniated disc she developed after years of intense training. She asked Terhaar for a reduced schedule while she recovered. Terhaar refused, and when Lind started to feel twinges in her back as she returned to rowing, she decided to retire.  In an email, Terhaar said this was not true. He said he had approved a reduced training schedule, but wouldn’t allow Lind an easier path to making Team USA. Lind was “not competitive or not healthy at the time of trials,” Terhaar wrote.  After years of babysitting and doing other odd jobs so she could train, Lind  —   a    Princeton graduate  —   is looking for a   job for the first time in years. Other rowers are upset over the massive pay gap between coaches and athletes, Lind said, but “the national team isn’t really a place where athletes can have a voice. ” “If Tom is making the ultimate decision on who’s [on Team USA] . . . You’re not going to go up and complain about his salary and your salary,” Lind said. “People are afraid. ” Merry, the US Rowing CEO, said concerns about athlete pay “keep him up at night,” but he defended the disparity between what he pays his coaches and his rowers as the best use of limited resources to try to win the most medals possible. “Athlete support is   but the quality of coaches, without that, there are no medals,” Merry said. “What a coach does is not the same as an athlete. It’s not apples to apples. An athlete is pursuing a dream. ”                                              "
" President Obama granted clemency to a record 214 inmates on Wednesday, far surpassing his previous   record, as part of an ongoing effort to release federal inmates serving prison terms deemed to be unduly harsh. To date, Obama has commuted the sentences of 562 federal inmates, more than the previous nine presidents combined. The White House said in a statement that the president will continue commuting the sentences of inmates through his remaining months in office. “Today began like any other for 214 federal inmates across the country, but ultimately became a day I am confident they will never forget,” said Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel. The 214 inmates freed represent the most commutations in a single day since at least 1900, Eggleston said.   [Obama’s crusade against a criminal justice system devoid of ‘second chances’]   Typically, Obama has granted clemency to 40 or 50 inmates a month. In this case, 67 of the 214 inmates had been sentenced to life in prison. Almost all of those released from their sentences on Wednesday had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes, according to the White House.  The White House said the large number of commutations underscores the need for broader criminal justice reform, which has some bipartisan support but has stalled in Congress.  “While we continue to work to act on as many clemency applications as possible, only legislation can bring about lasting change to the federal system,” Eggleston said. “It is critical that both the House and the Senate continue to work on a bipartisan basis to get a criminal justice reform bill to the President’s desk. ” According to the Justice Department, those whose sentences were commuted by Obama on Wednesday were: • Timothy Adams  —   Hartsville, S. C. Offense: Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base (crack); Middle District of North Carolina.

"   Donald Trump has only been doing Fox News these days,* but on Wednesday night his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, gamely ventured into the unfriendly confines of Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show. What followed was a fascinating, lengthy    over the importance of policy to Trump, among many other topics. The whole thing is worth a scan. Below, we annotate it. To see the annotations, click on the highlighted yellow text. And if you want to make your own annotations    which you can do!    you’ll need a Genius account.     MADDOW:  It is special occasion night here tonight on the ”Rachel Maddow Show.” We are going to start right off at the top of the show, not with me talking for 17 straight minutes, but rather with ”The Interview.” I have had the opportunity on this show this year to interview Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton a handful of times.  I have not yet had the pleasure of interviewing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  I live in hope that that interview will happen here and sometime soon. But in the meantime, I’m very excited to say that I’ve got what I think of as the next best thing.  We are joined tonight for ”The Interview” by Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, thank you so much for being here. CONWAY:  My pleasure, Rachel.  Thanks for having me. MADDOW:  I have to ask you,   off the top, if it is a hard decision to do a show like this with liberal commie pinko like me.  Or do you guys have a   …     CONWAY:  I’ve never described you that way.  No, it’s a real pleasure.  I did want to pass along a hello from Donald Trump.  I talked to him this evening and I told him I was coming on your show.  He said, that’s such a terrific idea.  And I said I hope that I’m just like your   band, your   and that you’ll come on the show sometime too.  So maybe you convince us in the tower. MADDOW:  Well, I would love to do that.  Let’s  —   I don’t want to spoil it, so maybe we should just call it off right here and say, that’s the end of the interview.  No. Let me start actually by saying, congratulations.  This is your first presidential campaign manager gig, obviously. CONWAY:  As a manager, yes. MADDOW:  But it’s also the first time any woman has ever managed a Republican presidential campaign ever, so you’re in history for that. Can I just ask you, how you got the gig?  Did you interview?  Did other people interview?  How did this come about? CONWAY:  Well, first of all, thank you.  I didn’t even know I was the first female Republican presidential campaign manager until someone pointed it out to me on Twitter.  They pointed it out for me and I said, that can’t be true. And then I realized, I said this must be such a small group of women.  And right away I know them all, Susan Estrich and Donna Brazile and Beth Myers, and I respect them enormously.  And it took me about two seconds into the job to see how much is on your shoulders, when you are the campaign manager. And they did it far longer than I did.  I’m coming in toward the end of the campaign.  So hats off to them. I think I got the job through the way Donald Trump has promoted women in the Trump Corporation for decades, through merit.  And he saw the way I move.  He knows I don’t sugarcoat things, but I’m very polite in delivering them.         And I felt like we had been losing for a couple of weeks.  And I just  —   instead of going in there and saying, we’re losing and if you have another week like this, you’re done, I just said, you know, we’re a little bit behind and I think it’s good to be the underdog. You always say, I never lose, I’m not accustomed to losing, fine.  But we are a little bit behind and we’re really behind in some places.  And so let’s at least bring it to a slightly new direction. I think once you have a buoyant candidate who feels comfortable doing the   pivot on substance, where he has gotten so many people giving him the advice, solicited, unsolicited, from both sides of the aisle to pivot on style, he’s so comfortable going out and telling everybody, here’s my   plan to reform the Veterans Administration. We as a nation  —   I hope it’s a completely nonpartisan issue, that we as a nation share the goal of treating our veterans fairly and with dignity and in a timely fashion for their health care needs. If he goes out and he says, here’s my   tax plan, or here’s my   way to defeat ISIS, and he actually has specifics, he’s so comfortable and he so enjoys doing that. And you can look at the specifics, Rachel, and you can say, I disagree with them, I think this will never work, I think it’s cockamamie, but at least you can see them.  And   …     MADDOW:  When you say pivot on substance, do you mean that he is changing some of his policy positions? CONWAY:  No, no, I meant the pivot has been more to substance.  Because I think, my own view as a voter and as an old hand politically, Rachel, is that so much of this campaign and the campaign coverage, but so much of the campaign has been   cacophony, like no substance being discussed. And I think that’s a shame for the voters.  I don’t know a billion things about a billion things, but I know consumers, and I know voters.  I’ve been doing this for decades.  And when I talk to voters and I look down in the focus group, at their household income, and I look at the unemployed status and I hear them, and I know that they deserve to at least have a full debate on the issues this time. And why do we have to wait for the actual debates for that?  Let’s have a debate on his vision for the next steps after the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, and Secretary Clinton’s. Let’s compare them on energy independence.  Let’s compare them.  She referred to  —   in her convention speech to  —   I assume she meant ISIS, but she called them our ”determined enemies.” He calls them ISIS.  He calls them radical terrorists. I was offended last year when she referred to   Republicans as terrorists.  I didn’t think that was nice or true, but she won’t refer to the terrorists as terrorists.  So my point is   …     MADDOW:  Do you think she doesn’t recognize ISIS as terrorists? CONWAY:  I sure hope she does.  And I think she does, but why doesn’t she say it? MADDOW:  Wait, hold on   …     CONWAY:  Why ”determined enemies”? MADDOW:  She’s never called ISIS terrorists?  Or she didn’t in that instance? CONWAY:  Of course she has.  But here she was in front of millions of people, her largest audience ever. MADDOW:  But  —   okay, so but you’re talking about  —   you’re just saying let’s keep it on substance, it shouldn’t necessarily be this cacophony that’s just about the campaign itself. CONWAY:  It’s a great word, isn’t. MADDOW:  It is. But some of the cacophony has been because your candidate has picked some unusual fights, because he has conducted himself as a candidate in a way that really other campaigns haven’t. Right after you started, he gave this remarkable set of remarks, where he said that he regretted some of the things he’d said because they caused personal pain, and he has repeatedly refused to say which of those things he regrets. But I guess I want to know whether or not any of those things are going to be put to bed because he’ll apologize for them.  Like when he said that Judge Curiel  —   Judge Gonzalo Curiel essentially couldn’t do his job as a judge, he would be inherently biased, and couldn’t do that job because of his Mexican heritage, that is something that I imagine caused great personal pain. Did Donald Trump ever apologize to the judge for that? CONWAY:  I don’t know that he has. MADDOW:  Do you think he will? CONWAY:  But I  —   well, here’s what I do know.  I think that his now running mate, Governor Pence, when he wasn’t his running mate, put it best about the Judge Curiel situation.  He said, I know what Donald Trump meant.  And here’s what it is. Every American deserves a fair trial with an impartial judge, but we do not question one’s impartiality based on their ethnicity, race, and a whole host of other   …     MADDOW:  Which Mr. Trump did, explicitly, for this judge. CONWAY:  And I thought  —   it’s funny, I don’t even know if Mr. Trump noticed that response at the time, but I thought, well, that’s really somebody who has worked with other countries, that really captures it.  And that’s the way I feel. But I do hope, Rachel, that people who feel that they have been caused personal pain by Donald Trump, looked at his regrets last week in a very public form.  And it’s very unusual for anybody who is running for political office to  —   frankly, to ever say that they regret causing personal pain. And I hope that anybody who feels that way will at least see that contrition and take that and at least accept his regret.  And   …     MADDOW:  But there’s no apology.  I mean   …     CONWAY:  Well, that would be done in private anyway. MADDOW:  And you’re saying it may have been done and you don’t know, or you know that it hasn’t been done? CONWAY:  I don’t know either way. MADDOW:  Okay.  And with the Khan family  —   I mean, with Mrs. Khan, I mean, in terms of personal pain, he said about her that he didn’t  —   I can tell you exactly what he said.  He said: ”She had nothing to say.  She probably  —   maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.” She rebutted that by saying, listen, she didn’t speak in that moment because she’s so   by the death of her son that cannot speak about him without crying.  I mean, talk about personal pain. What an incredibly painful thing for him to have accused her of.  And, again, he said that he regrets causing it.  Do you know if he’s apologized to the Khan family directly? CONWAY:  I don’t know. And I certainly hope that they heard him last Thursday in Charlotte when he said that. Rachel, let me just say how I feel, if it’s at all relevant.  I think that the Khan’s son is a hero, and I’m glad he’s in Arlington National Cemetery, and I think he made the ultimate sacrifice, as did they, and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. I have four small children, including a son.  I can’t even put my mind where their hearts are, because that is a very painful thing to even think about. But I also think people should look at the full measure of each of these candidates and not always judge that  —   well, not just judge him by one or two things that he has said here.  I just feel like we with should look at   …     MADDOW:  To be fair, though, I think those things that he’s getting consistently judged for, and people are not letting them go, is because they’re so unusual.  I mean, for any presidential candidate, for any politician to get into a personal fight with a   family is so strange, it’s so unusual. I mean, not just as a political miscalculation, it’s just  —   it almost  —   it’s humanly shocking and I think that’s why he is the only one who can ever put that to rest.  I think as his campaign manager, you’re going to get asked about those stories again and again and again all the way through November unless . .. CONWAY:  And I can’t speak for him on that, I really can’t speak for him on that, because it’s very personal, I can speak for me.    MADDOW:  Let me ask about policy then. Is it still the policy of the Trump campaign and of Mr. Trump that there should be a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on. That was his statement on that matter. Is that still the policy of the campaign and the candidate? CONWAY:  What he has said, and he repeated it, and again, people can pull it up for themselves if they’d like, Rachel. What he said recently, when he was delivering his entire fighting radical Islamic terrorist speech   …     MADDOW:  The Ohio speech, yes. CONWAY:  The Ohio speech, that’s right. A week ago Monday. Seems so long ago. MADDOW:  I know, every day is a   …     (CROSSTALK) CONWAY:  Yes, they’re like dog years, in politics, I’ve decided. What he said there was that we are going to ban people from entry here from countries that are known exporters of terrorism, which we can’t sufficiently vet.  So that is not every everybody, that’s not every continent. MADDOW:  But does that statement rescind the earlier statement?  Does that mean that  —   I mean, it was very clear what he said in December, and he put it in writing, right?  A total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.  It was very clear.  Is that now no longer operable as the statement of the Trump campaign? Should we see this new statement about countries that have a history of exporting terrorism, should we see that supplanting that earlier statement? (CROSSTALK) CONWAY:  Well, I don’t think it supplants it at all. MADDOW:  So they both exist? CONWAY:  I think that  —   well, yes, they do, because I think it clarifies it, in terms of, well, what does this actually mean? MADDOW:  So what about a Muslim who wants to emigrate here from Australia? CONWAY:  Well, it depends.  Do they have a record of terror?  Are they tied to any groups?  Are they  —   I mean, we  —   look, his entire point is very simple, Rachel, if I may. Whether it’s an   lone wolf terrorist in Orlando who shoots up 49 innocent people in a nightclub, or it’s folks coming in on a fiancee visa that federal agents I’ve talked to didn’t even know existed, in San Bernardino, to kill 14 innocent   or it’s what happens in Nice, in Brussels, in Paris, and so many other places around the globe, this has to stop. And the fact is we have to do a better job as a government, because somehow we’re not doing a great job. MADDOW:  Do you stop it by stopping all Muslims? CONWAY:  No. MADDOW:  Okay.  So that policy is no longer   …     CONWAY:  Well, you look at his speech from last Monday and I think you find your answer, where he says, look, we are going to stop allowing countries that export terrorists, that we can’t get a good vetting system with them, and frankly . .. MADDOW:  I’ve got the quote.  He said he would suspend immigration from ”regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism.” CONWAY:  That’s right. MADDOW:  So on   four airliners were hijacked.  Three of the four were piloted by men who had most recently lived and operated their cell in Germany.  Right?  We all know this, right?  Hamburg, Germany.  So is Germany a country from which we will not allow immigration anymore? CONWAY:  No, not wholesale.  Because there are so many other ways that we could have at least captured, or I should say, known that those  —   that that particular   cell was here nefariously. I mean, who were the people teaching them how to fly a plane in Florida that they never had an interest in learning to land it?  You know, we  —   after   it was see something, say something. But before that, we had them  —   you know, they could have been monitored in a way, if there was a reasonable suspicion that they had, that they were tied to terrorism.  So in that particular instance, with the   terrorists, it’s very hard to believe it has been 15 years, Rachel. But with that particular instance, I’d have to go back and review what we knew about each of them at the time before I answer your question completely.  But the general policy is what he says it is, which is . .. MADDOW:  What he says is a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. CONWAY:  That was  —   and now it’s   …     MADDOW:  Before.  But you are saying that’s no longer operable. CONWAY:  I’m saying that you should see what he said last Monday, where he is saying suspend it from regions or countries that are known exporters of terrorism. MADDOW:  Like Germany, which makes no sense. CONWAY:  Well, no, no   …     MADDOW:  I mean, there’s a reason that we keep, again, not moving on from this stuff.  This was how  —   in December, when made this statement, right, on December 7th it was like every political firework in the country went off all at once, because nobody could believe that somebody who was running for president of this country by promising that if you are of a specific religion, you’re no longer allowed to come here. (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  If that’s no longer the case, that would be a really big deal.  But it can’t be that we’re not supposed to hold him accountable for that statement anymore, but he hasn’t rescinded it. In the same way that his statement of regret, if it’s meant to apply to the Khan family or the Curiel family, we can’t give him credit to that unless he actually tells us, and tells us that he has communicated that to the Curiel and the Khan family. The thread that ties these things together is this is all stuff of his own making.  And if you want the campaign to not be about this stuff anymore, it seems to me like he’s the one who has to end all these controversies by telling us what he really means. You’re in a position of trying to defend what he said last week, and not refer to what he said in December, but only one of them can be true. CONWAY:  Well, Rachel, I have memorized the list of 22   that Hillary Clinton has made on policy, and they have nothing to do even with the corrupt Clinton Foundation State Department    connection, they have to do with policy. And I think Bernie Sanders was right on many of those things when he was calling her out for them.  And we will call her out for them if others won’t.  So we feel that it’s legitimate   …     MADDOW:  But your own campaign is about your own candidate, right? CONWAY:  Well, no, no.  There’s a choice in this country. MADDOW:  No? CONWAY:  Yes, this campaign in totem is about two candidates.  And if I can say one thing about the coverage, it’s not that it’s biased or slanted.  It’s incomplete.  It’s almost as if it’s a referendum on Donald Trump, it’s as if you’re going to go into the ballot box on November 8th, Rachel, and it’s going to be a big picture of Donald Trump with a light like you either put a black X over him, or you say yea.  That’s not the case. MADDOW:  But that’s obviously what happens   …     CONWAY:  She’s running too. MADDOW:  When one candidates running is planning on banning people from the United States   …     CONWAY:  And the other is hiding.  And the other is hiding. MADDOW:  Okay.  But not doing press conferences is one thing.  But proposing a ban on people coming to the United States from people who are of a specific religion, it’s always going to be a referendum on that candidate. CONWAY:  And she wants total  —   well, I think that’s unfair, actually.  I think it’s actually a disservice to the voters in that he is now giving speeches, several a week, where he’s laying out specific policy prescriptions, including on the matter of which you asked me. Where people can go and look and they can say, I don’t believe that, or I don’t like that, or wow, I didn’t realize that.  Let me try to digest this. And this is the stage in the election cycle where voters start to want to hear your specifics and your solutions. MADDOW:  Let me ask one more specific on that.  There’s this one from the Ohio speech, the terrorism speech, which I thought was just a fascinating turn, and it was on this issue of extreme vetting.  What he’s describing as extreme vetting for people who want to emigrate to this country. And what he said was, in the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test.  The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.  What is that about?  What’s the Cold War precedent for this extreme vetting that he’s talking about? CONWAY:  He’s basically saying, this is not the first time the country has done this, or that it has been done.  That we’ve done this before, but for some reason, we’ve become lax.  We don’t do it. MADDOW:  When did we do it before? CONWAY:  Well, he’s just saying, there’s a Cold War precedent.  And   …     MADDOW:  But what is the Cold War precedent? CONWAY:  For vetting.  And he’s saying that in this case, it’s that we  —   past is not necessarily prologue, but that when you are talking about vetting, people shouldn’t comment like, oh, my God, that’s a new situation. What if we did vet people based on their ties to terrorism, if we did that a little bit better?  I mean, is anybody arguing that we’re not letting people in the country right now who do have ties to terrorists? MADDOW:  The Cold War precedent for what he’s talking about was an ideological vetting.  He’s saying we want ideological vetting of people.  That did exist in the Cold War, in the early ’50s, it was called the McCarran Act, which I’m sure you know. CONWAY:  Sure. MADDOW:  And Truman vetoed it and then Congress was able to pass it some other way.  But what survived very famously was thrown out by the United States Supreme Court because it was ruled to be unconstitutional. So there is a Cold War precedent for ideological vetting of immigrants.  In that case, it was to stop communist front groups.  But it didn’t pass constitutional muster, and we’ve never had anything like that since that ever has passed constitutional muster. So what he’s asking for is a new extreme vetting system, which has previously been tried and ruled unconstitutional and we abandoned it half a century ago. CONWAY:    years ago, right? MADDOW:  Yes.  So that’s a hard case  —   so I want the pivot on substance to happen too.  I really do.  But the substance   …     CONWAY:  Like four issues a week now though that he’s talking about.  He really doesn’t   …     (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  But he has to make sense.  He has to make sense when he makes these policy pivots in order for them to be successful. CONWAY:  Well, it sounds like you disagree with the policy, and that’s fine.  And   …     (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  No, you can’t have a McCarran Act now, it’s unconstitutional. CONWAY:  But that’s my point too.  People can look at it and say, this is ridiculous, that’s unconstitutional, you can’t have that, or they can say, that may work, and I’d like to hear more about it. But either way, I feel very confident that our campaign is the one of the major two now, Rachel, that actually respects the voters, and what they tell pollsters they want, which policy prescriptions, a conversation about substance. I said this before, but I’ll say on your show, I would rather lose a campaign about style, than  —   or who said what today about whom, than not  —   than lose it on substance.  Because I feel like the issue set favors us. I mean, people in the last   polls taken on Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, you have many people who still have problems with  —   you have many millions of Americans uninsured, you have people still looking for work, you have some schools that are failing our students. And the fact is, Hillary Clinton, from what we’re told, is going to give a speech tomorrow about none of that.  Her speech is going to be about Donald Trump. MADDOW:  She’s going to give a speech about you guys, that’s right. CONWAY:  Well, but that’s odd.  And I watch  —   it’s odd for this reason.  Again, it’s not  —   she’s running for president of the United States.  And presidents have to have vision and show leadership in a way that you make the election about the future, not the past. And you make it about your own beliefs and your own values and vision, not just trying to make the other person look like he takes the wings off of butterflies.  It’s an odd construct.  I watched Robby Mook.  I watched Robby Mook in your interview last week.  I said, oh, I hope I get to do that, I watched him interviewed my first day on the job.  And I really did want to come. Robby is such a smart guy.  He’s very loyal to Hillary Clinton.  He knows what he’s doing.  He’s a great competitor.  And yet most of his  —   much of his interview was about Donald Trump.  And I keep looking at that and saying, when are we going to hear from you? I mean, scarcity is their strategy.  Politico ran a headline today that said Hillary Clinton’s strategy to run out the clock to November.  I think that’s a disservice to voters.  I think she just ought to lay it all out and say my policies on X, Y and Z are right, and yours are wrong. MADDOW:  Kellyanne Conway is our guest.  She is the campaign manager for Donald Trump’s campaign, the first woman to ever be a campaign manager in a Republican presidential campaign.  And I have just secretly chained her to the desk.  So she’ll be here when we get back from the commercial break.  Hold on. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   MADDOW:  We’re back with Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager for the Donald Trump for president campaign.  One week ago tonight she became the first woman to ever run a Republican presidential campaign. Kellyanne, thanks again for being here. CONWAY:  Thank you. MADDOW:  Why  —   don’t take this the wrong way. (LAUGHTER) MADDOW:  Why on earth is your candidate in Mississippi tonight if everything you could possibly imagine that was bad for your candidate happened between now and November and everything great for Hillary Clinton happened between now and November, your candidate is still going to win Mississippi by double digits. CONWAY:  That’s right. MADDOW:  Why is he in Mississippi? CONWAY:  And Hillary Clinton is still going to win California by double digits and she has been there raising money . .. (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  But she’s raising money, he’s doing a rally. CONWAY:  Oh, no, he had fundraiser before that. MADDOW:  Right, but then they’re just doing the fundraising and then booking out to a swing state.  He does a rally, which means you’re spending money to keep him down there.  You’re paying the opportunity cost of him being somewhere else.  You’re paying money to rent the venue.  You’re having him do this rally. Again, don’t take it the wrong way. CONWAY:  And it’s on national news here in a   state in New York. MADDOW:  Here he is in Mississippi, but you’re wasting your donors’ money.  I mean, the best possible outcome of this is that he might win by extra double digits.  Why is he there? CONWAY:  He was there because he wanted to do a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, because he  —   the governor has been talking to him about coming down and he had  —   I don’t know if your audience is aware, but he had Mr. Farage, the leader of Brexit, on the stage with him tonight and basically gave his big old epic Brexit speech on American independence. MADDOW:  Isn’t it a little weird to have the like secessionist guy give a speech in Mississippi. CONWAY:  But in Jackson, Mississippi   …     MADDOW:  Yes, you get why that’s weird, right? (LAUGHTER) MADDOW:  Go to a Union state next time. CONWAY:  But I will tell you that I think the people who came before me developed a very sound infrastructure.  But we have inherited a schedule that we are taking better control of in terms of I’m a very focused person and I see which states we’re going into with candidate appearances, that’s both for Governor Pence and Mr. Trump. Our ground game, our data operation, our field really focusing on the states that get us to   in a couple of different ways. MADDOW:  You can’t get out of Mississippi because it was already planned. CONWAY:  Well, no, it was already planned.  And honestly, when I first asked about that rally, to give you a little inside peek, when I first asked about that rally in a scheduling meeting last week, they said, well, it went live this morning, you know, too bad we didn’t have this conversation  —   it went live this morning.  And the venue was already   full. MADDOW:  Right, it’s Mississippi. (CROSSTALK) CONWAY:    …     but it’s national news.  You’re covering it, the rest of you are covering it.  So  —   and he’ll be home tonight. MADDOW:  So let me ask you another one.  New York.  Home for Donald Trump.  The national political director for your campaign is   …     CONWAY:  Jim Murphy. MADDOW:  Jim Murphy, yes.  Jim Murphy quoted in The New York Post two days ago that there’s going to be an   full steam ahead, top speed effort in New York, a full plan, ground game, media, Internet, direct mail, maybe phone banks for New York. And then the reason I’m asking you about this, is he then told The New York Post he was acting at your behest specifically and named you, in saying that this is why there’s such a focus on New York State, where you are on a good day, behind by 17 points.  That doesn’t sound like you.  That doesn’t sound like your kind of focus. CONWAY:  It wasn’t me.  But it would be exciting to challenge Hillary Clinton here, just on her Senate record in New York alone.  I hope you get an opportunity to interview her.  I hope if she comes and enjoys her time in this seat, Rachel, as I am tonight, that you’ll ask her the question, you know, why was your Senate record here in this state so unremarkable? But I have a 3:30 call tomorrow with Jim and I’ll ask him about that article that I had not seen. MADDOW:  Sorry, Jim, I didn’t mean to get you in trouble. CONWAY:  But I’ll say something else, Jim is onto something very important that I think is missed in the   conversation politically, Rachel, which is, we have great teams in different states. We may not be competing at this moment.  And we’re going to start moving people around to these swing states.  And that’s very typical of campaigns, they do that.  You decide where are your strengths, where do you want to sew up some of these poll numbers. Which, you know, even in a place like North Carolina today, we’re behind by 2, according to a public poll.  Arizona, we’re ahead by 5.  You know, things are starting to look a little bit better.  But these battleships turn slowly. But if we have a fabulous state director somewhere where we end up not competing as hard, and they’re talented, we’ll move them around because that’s what smart campaigns do.  You say, how do we refocus our talents and where do we put our candidates? And we’ve been working with Governor Pence’s staff as well in trying to do that, because he’s an incredibly strong speaker in some of these swing states.  He gets large crowds.  They want to hear his message.  They connect with him. And I told Governor Pence, you’re like the golden child, you eat your vegetables, you do your homework in homework club, he’s just done a phenomenal job for this ticket.  And he keeps his own schedule. I think every 10 days or so, we’re going to try to get Trump and Pence together in one place as well.  But you’ll see some changes.  You’re going to have a   Day bonanza of a new type of schedule.  Promise. MADDOW:  Okay.  You used the phrase ”golden child” there, which I have to quote back to you, because that is one of the phrases that was used ironically, or sarcastically by the new chief executive of the Trump campaign, Steve Bannon, to describe Paul Ryan. He has called Paul Ryan a liar, he has called him a golden child, and he didn’t mean it in a good way.  He said   …     CONWAY:  I did, by the way. MADDOW:  You meant it in a good way, exactly, when you were talking about Governor Pence.  But that’s not how he meant it about Paul Ryan.  He once said of Paul Ryan recently that Paul Ryan was raised in a Petri dish at the Heritage Foundation. So Breitbart, under Steve Bannon’s leadership, has been the biggest media cheerleader on the right for the resignation of John Boehner, for the defeat of Eric Cantor, and for this year’s challenge to Paul Ryan, who is the current Republican speaker of the house.  How’s it going between Speaker Ryan and your campaign? CONWAY:  It’s going well. MADDOW:  Since Steve Bannon came on board?  In the past week, you and Steve Bannon came on at the same time. CONWAY:  That’s right, nothing has changed in terms of Speaker Ryan having endorsed Donald Trump and Donald Trump having endorsed Speaker Ryan. I did tease Mr. Trump, Rachel, by saying, hey, you went and endorsed him, and he won his primary with 84 percent of the vote, you didn’t take the credit.  Had I been here, we would have taken the credit.  Paul, you went from 82 to 84. MADDOW:  If you really need Paul Ryan down the stretch, he has a certain amount of power and sway. CONWAY:  Yes, he’s the speaker of the house. (CROSSTALK) CONWAY:  And he would be the speaker of the house in a Trump presidency. MADDOW:  So you’ve now got his chief political antagonist from the conservative media with you, running the Trump campaign.  Steve Bannon has been not just a provocateur on the right, not just a controversial guy, he specifically set his sights on trying to destroy Paul Ryan. He’s after John McCain.  He’s after Paul Ryan.  He stood up and cheered about John Boehner, and about Eric Cantor.  The way that he celebrated Eric Cantor losing his seat.  I understand, if you’re a Republican insurgent why that must be very exciting.  But if you’re the Republican Party, if they’re going to be responsible for a lot of the ground game and all of this stuff, how could they work with him? CONWAY:  We had Sean Spicer in our shared office just the other day.  So it’s  —   that’s the chief strategist working on the   …     MADDOW:  They’re just swallowing it.  They’re just   …     CONWAY:  No, they’re not swallowing it.  In fact, I talk to Chairman Priebus once or twice a day now.  And I really like the way that the official  —   you know, the Republican Party nationally, Rachel, is treating us and working with us. I’m really pleased with that.  And I think it comes on the heels of this  —   letters people are writing, please put the resources   and please, don’t destroy the Republican Party. Chairman Priebus doesn’t feel that way and Speaker Ryan doesn’t.  And I’ll tell you what, in a Trump presidency, I’ll be the first one to go up and thank Speaker Ryan and work with him.  We both worked for Jack Kemp at different points in our career. MADDOW:  How about Steve Bannon? CONWAY:  Oh, he’ll do it too.  Steve, yes. MADDOW:  After doing everything he could to destroy him, calling him a liar and all that? CONWAY:  Well, and they both have really big jobs now.  So there you go.  True to say, they both endorsed Donald Trump. (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  But do you have to wear chain mail when you go to work?  This environment that you work in, it’s like actively on fire every day. CONWAY:  Come and visit us, Rachel, bring your camera. MADDOW:  I absolutely will. CONWAY:  Come visit us in the tower.  I just invited you.  I just got my first piece of hate mail to my home   …     (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  Oh no, I’m sorry. CONWAY:  No, I’m just saying, it’s a crazy time, but it’s very rewarding and I’m telling you, I really think that the case for change that so many Americans are making, that they say, 70 percent is saying, take us in a different direction, that’s a change election. You know, you see the polls, including NBC’s polls, Rachel, that a vast majority of Americans dislike Hillary Clinton, distrust her.  And I certainly hope that we’re not now inured to that because it has happened for so long. I mean, there were some serious revelations this week.  And I saw someone on TV, like someone I respect enormously from the other side of the aisle last night say the following, while the Clinton Foundation scandal unfolding seems serious and we’ll take a look at it, but the next time Donald Trump says something crazy, then we’ll forget about this. And I thought, if it’s worthy of examination, if the allegations of pay to play and these visits from people, and these foreign donations are actually bothersome, then  —   and actually worthy of examination on a show like yours, Rachel, then that doesn’t wash away because Donald Trump said something that day. And that’s my point about full coverage. MADDOW:  On that issue of the Clinton Foundation, the very strong statement from your campaign two days ago, saying the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history.  If it’s such a vehicle for corruption, why did Donald Trump donate so much money to it? CONWAY:  He donated $100, 000, and certainly didn’t donate for the same reason these foreign donors did, apparently.  He didn’t ask to get a meeting with the secretary of state to talk about donating to the Clinton Foundation, like apparently 85 other people did. MADDOW:  Well, asking and getting is not . .. CONWAY:  To the tune of $156 million. MADDOW:  Asking and getting is not the same thing. CONWAY:  But the Clinton Foundation does some good work.  I mean, there’s no question about that.  They do very important work. MADDOW:  But they’re the most corrupt enterprise in political history, that’s your statement. CONWAY:  Apparently you can be both. (LAUGHTER) CONWAY:  Apparently you can be both.  So we see the good work they do around the globe.  And, you know, Rachel, I was thinking about this today, they could do much  —   they could do even better, more good work, if you will, if some of those donations weren’t  —   you know, weren’t, I guess, received as a way to, in the State Department, and why are you giving it any  —   did we need to have meetings in the State Department with foreign donors and then pretend all that money is just for vaccinations and   …     MADDOW:  Well, there’s no indication that the money went for anything other than back to the Clinton programs. CONWAY:  Well, let’s find out.  I think Governor Christie had this right.  I think Governor Christie had this right yesterday.  He said, look, we actually don’t know the facts.  And three different FBI divisions asked the DOJ to investigate, and they did not  —   either did not return their calls or refused to investigate. But Governor Christie is right, Rachel.  He said yesterday, look, we as Americans have the need to know what the facts are before we cast a vote.  I think there’s something to that.  We already know how America feels about Washington. The lack of transparency, the lack of accountability, the corruption, the rigged system that helps insiders.  This doesn’t look good for someone who is already distrusted and disliked by a majority of Americans.    MADDOW:  But then to the same point, I don’t want to go    on the Clinton Foundation, and I hear you, absolutely, but to that same point, I mean, every presidential candidate in the modern era has released his or her tax returns, including  —   I mean, back to Nixon, right? And when Nixon set that precedent he was under audit.  So it’s not  —   being under audit is not an excuse to not release your tax returns.  The IRS says if you’re under audit, you’re totally allowed to release your tax returns.  And previous presidents and presidential candidates have. Donald Trump is running for president in part on the basis of his financial acumen and saying that the system is rigged.  And there has been a lot of really troubling reporting about his business practices, as well, you know, I mean, a lot of stuff that may or may not been followed all the way to its conclusion. But talk about raising questions, there has been stuff.  Why should this audit out only apply to him?  I mean, everybody else has released their tax returns, why shouldn’t he? CONWAY:  Well, that’s the conclusion that his lawyers and accountants have made and the advice they’ve given him and he’s respecting that advice. But I also don’t   …     MADDOW:  Do you respect it?  Do you think that he should release his tax returns? CONWAY:  Well, I do respect it only because I once thought, oh, transparency, release your tax returns.  But the fact is now that I’m there, I hear what the advice that the lawyers and the accountants have given. But I don’t think that we need to see his tax returns to verify his financial acumen.  I walk into the Trump Tower every day and I’m like, this guy did pretty well for himself before I got here. MADDOW:  I want to know if he pays taxes. CONWAY:  And he  —   well, like you know what you want to know, Rachel, we all want to know what taxes we would pay under his tax plan.  That’s a question   …     (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  No, no, trust me, I really literally want to know if he pays taxes.  I have two more things to ask you.  Do you mind staying? CONWAY:  No.  Oh, another break. MADDOW:  Another break, sorry.  Kellyanne, campaign manager for Donald Trump, I promise just one more break and we’ll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    MADDOW:  We’re back with Kellyanne Conway, who is the first woman to ever be the campaign manager for a Republican presidential campaign.  It is her first presidential campaign management gig.  And she has been in it for precisely one week, most of which you’ve spend here in the studio with me tonight. (LAUGHTER) MADDOW:  I know it feels like I’m never going to let you go.  I have two more questions. CONWAY:  Yes. MADDOW:  One is about this health issue, and I have a very specific question about this.  So Mr. Trump personally and members of your campaign have repeatedly now raised this question of Secretary Clinton’s health. Now the only testimony we have of Mr. Trump’s health is this letter from his gastroenterologist saying that his lab results were astonishingly excellent and the letter ends by saying: ”If elected Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever be elected to the presidency.” And that’s really funny, but as a doctor’s letter, it’s a little bit absurd.  It’s a   letter.  It’s full of typos.  It’s hyperbolic.  It’s unprofessional.  Most of the letter has no medical meaning.  It links to a website that doesn’t exist. If he was elected, Donald Trump would be the oldest person to ever be sworn in as president.  Whether or not he’s going to try to make Hillary Clinton’s health the issue, doesn’t he owe it to the American people to release an actual medical report, a more credible, more complete statement? CONWAY:  Perhaps.  But I want to say something about Hillary Clinton’s health.  It’s not an issue that I care to comment on, because I’m not a doctor.  She’s not my patient.  And I can just tell you what I see with my own two eyes which is I don’t see someone who really enjoys campaigning the way he does. I can only tell you about him, because I’m with him practically every day, which is, he keeps such a crazy, ridiculous pace for a man his age, that it’s very difficult for the younger staffers, of which I’m not one, to keep up with him, Rachel. I mean, it’s really insane.  I mean, he called me yesterday and said, I need more rallies, are we doing a rally here?  What are we doing?  I’m like, you know, he doesn’t just show up and do the rallies.  He prepares for them.  You have to travel.  He’s always reading, he’s always thinking, he’s always talking. I confess, I don’t know when he sleeps. MADDOW:  Yes, but both you, here as his campaign and him talking about himself have made his physical vigor actually part of what he brings to the campaign, part of what he offers, and they’ve made it a contrast issue with Hillary Clinton. But Hillary Clinton released a normal doctor’s statement.  What we have got from Donald Trump, that letter really is absurd.  And we’ve actually contacted the doctor who wrote it to try to get some background.  It turns out he was using a medical credential on his name that he’s no longer entitled to use. Like there’s a lot of really not upstanding things about what we know there.  And so, I mean, for one, why is  —   a gastroenterologist is a digestive specialist.  Why has Donald Trump been seeing a gastroenterologist for 35 years? CONWAY:  Oh, that I don’t know for sure.  There are certain things I just haven’t learned in the last week, Rachel, I promise. (LAUGHTER) MADDOW:  As the campaign manager, can I please make a request? CONWAY:  Yes, please, absolutely. MADDOW:  That we get a more substantial medical   …     CONWAY:  I will pass on the request.  And I assure you that he does have doctors  —   he has doctors and physicians.  And I want to also add one more thing.  I was told by a different anchor last night on a different network, that Hillary’s doctors have released her part of her medical information, her health history, and that she’s in good health. And I say great, because I want her to be in excellent health.  In other words, that’s just not  —   I think stamina is different than health.  You know, vigor on the campaign trail. But I look at Hillary Clinton not being out there more as a strategy.  It’s scarcity as a strategy.  It’s that we don’t want to put her out there, because when we do, people are reminded that she doesn’t meet the 70 percent of Americans who want a change election, a new direction. She is the person who has earned a majority of Americans, Rachel, saying, I dislike her and I distrust her, but  —   I can’t imagine what comes after the ”but.” What do you mean, but?  But I think I’ll vote for her, I think I’ll give it a whirl. MADDOW:  I think she’s  —   I mean, as just a political observer, I think the reason that she’s not out on the campaign trail as much doing visible events is because they think they’re winning and they don’t want to interrupt the narrative. CONWAY:  And I think that’s terrible and I’ll tell you why.  If we were winning just because Hillary Clinton was failing or tripping over her words, or messing up by not doing  —   you know, or she was down in the polls for whatever reason, let’s say the Clinton Foundation investigation helps her go down in the polls, we’re not going to disappear, I promise you, because that’s not what the voters want. They want to see the candidates.  They want to hear the candidates.  They want to digest their proposals that we’ve been discussing tonight, Rachel.  And they want to be able to see what the contrast is between these two. Not contrast in style, not even contrast in stamina, contrast on substance.  I’m telling you, we’re going to fight her on substance.  And I’m very disappointed, from what I know publicly, that her speech tomorrow in Reno, Nevada   …     MADDOW:  Is going to be all about you. CONWAY:  It’s not about substance. MADDOW:  Yes, well, it’s going to be  —   it’s about the Trump campaign, and this is my last question for you.  And I’m asking it just because I feel like I shouldn’t have to ask you, but I don’t have any access to anybody else with the campaign.  So I have to ask you.  It’s a factual question.  Is Roger Ailes working as part of the Donald Trump campaign? CONWAY:  No.  He is not a formal or informal adviser.  They’re old friends.  I mean, he’s Donald Trump.  He talks to a lot of people.  Something is always ringing. MADDOW:  So that meeting at the Bedminster golf club in New Jersey on Sunday, August 14th, that wasn’t  —   that didn’t happen?  Like, this is what the New York Times reported in terms of him coming on board to help Donald Trump prepare for the debates, and becoming a formal or informal adviser, that didn’t happen? CONWAY:  I was not there on August 14th.  So I didn’t see who was or was not there.  But I will tell you that they’re old friends and they talk.  I’m sure they talk, and I’m sure  —   but he talks to many different people from every side of the aisle   …     (CROSSTALK) MADDOW:  Roger Ailes, no role in the campaign though? CONWAY:  Roger Ailes has no formally or informal role in the campaign, no.  But he is a marketing genius. MADDOW:  And just resigned his job under a cloud of terrible sexual harassment allegations. CONWAY:  Thank you for having me, Rachel.  I just wanted to say, thank you for having me.  I mean, I know you work hard, I work hard.  But not every woman gets what we got, which is our shot.  And for that I’m most grateful.  And I feel most blessed. I’ve watched you for years on ”Scarborough Country” and Tucker’s show   …     MADDOW:  Wow. CONWAY:    …     and I said, she should have her own show.  And indeed, you have for a long time.  And I respect that enormously.  I know you disagree with us perhaps philosophically.  But I hope Mr. Trump will take the seat one day.  But thank you for having me on. MADDOW:  Thank you.  And back at you.  You know, I think it is  —   you have made history and I think women breaking glass ceilings in politics is always important wherever it happens.  And good luck to you. CONWAY:  Thank you. MADDOW:  Thanks, Kellyanne, really nice to see you. See, that was fine.  Everything went okay.  We can talk to each other.  It’s going to be all right. * It turns out Trump will get off his Fox kick and do an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday night.

Carlo    "
"     President Obama on Tuesday commuted the sentences for 111 inmates, the latest in his push to ease harsh penalties given to nonviolent drug offenders. Obama has been critical of what he has called the “devastating” effects of severe sentences handed down during the country’s war on drugs. He became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, and spoke there about the importance of “second chances. ” While the pace of commutations he granted had worried activists earlier this year, Obama has made a push in August to give clemency to scores of additional inmates. Earlier this month, Obama commuted the sentences of 214 other inmates, setting a   record for his administration. The 325 commutations he has announced this month are the most from any president in one month, the White House says, and have nearly doubled the total number he has granted while in office.  “Entire communities have been ravaged where largely men, but some women, are taken out of those communities,” Obama said during a news conference the day after he granted clemency to 214 inmates. “Kids are now growing up without parents. It perpetuates a cycle of poverty and disorder in their lives. It is disproportionately young men of color that are being arrested at higher rates, charged and convicted at higher rates, and imprisoned for longer sentences. ”   [One year out: What happened to 46 inmates after Obama commuted their sentences]   Obama said that he hoped the bipartisan push for criminal justice reform could wind up weighing how to fight crime alongside “the need for proportionality in sentencing and the need to rehabilitate those who commit crimes. ” This latest round announced Tuesday by the White House pushes the total number of commutations Obama has granted while in office to 673, nearly equal to the number of commutations issued by the previous 11 administrations combined (690).   BREAKING: @POTUS just commuted 111 people, bringing the total to more than the past 10 presidents combined. pic. twitter.   —   The White House (@WhiteHouse) August 30, 2016   “The clemency initiative is about more than the 111 people who learned today that their sentences have been commuted; it’s also about the families and communities who will welcome them home as they work to build a new life,” Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement. While the number of commutations Obama has granted far exceeds those of his predecessors dating back to World War II, they still impact a fraction of the country’s massive population of incarcerated people.   [How do presidential commutations and pardons work?]   At the end of 2014, there were more than 210, 000 inmates in federal correctional facilities, along with another 1. 3 million in state facilities, according to Justice Department statistics. That year, half of all men and more than half of women in federal prisons were serving time for drug offenses, according to the most recent numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which released them last fall. The number of inmates in federal prisons has declined to less than 195, 000 earlier this month, according to a memo Yates wrote outlining the Justice Department’s plans to stop using private prisons. With just months left in office, Obama faces a mountain of names seeking clemency and relatively little time to consider their petitions. According to the Justice Department, there were more than 11, 000 commutation petitions pending earlier this month, along with more than 1, 400 pardon petitions.   [Lack of resources, bureaucratic tangles have bogged down Obama’s clemency efforts]   In June, a group of experts, activists and former officials wrote to Obama urging him to speed up the process, worrying about the pace during the twilight of his administration. Obama said during his news conference earlier this month that his main criteria was finding people who would be given much shorter sentences today than they received decades ago, individuals who his administration believes have “tried to reform themselves while incarcerated” and deserve a second chance. “Our focus really has been on people who we think were overcharged and people who we do not believe have a propensity towards violence,” he said.

"         Donald Trump sat down with Dr. Mehmet Oz Wednesday to discuss his health and exercise habits. The show aired on Thursday. It was everything you might think an interview between Dr. Oz and Mr. Trump might be. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript. (This is a partial transcript for now. We’ll keep adding to it.)  TRUMP: Hello, doctor. OZ: Thank you for being here. TRUMP: Thank you. OZ: Thank you for joining us. TRUMP: It’s a great honor. OZ: As a doctor, I’m always focused on the person directly in front of me. TRUMP: Okay. OZ: I think we should agree we’re not going to discuss Secretary Clinton. Is that okay? TRUMP: I think it’s fine. We want her to get well, so I think that’s fine. OZ: How do you stay healthy on the campaign trail? TRUMP: It’s a lot of work. When I’m speaking in front of 15 and 20, 000 people and I’m up there using a lot of motion, I guess in it’s own way, it’s a pretty healthy act. I really enjoy doing it. A lot of times these rooms are very hot, like saunas, and I guess that is a form of exercise and, you know? OZ: So everyone’s is talking about the candidates’ medical records. TRUMP: Right. OZ: So I’d like to clear up some questions that folks are asking about your health. TRUMP: Okay. Okay, now I am hoping to go over these exact same questions with Secretary Clinton. And I’ll say this: As a doctor, when I have someone in front of me and I don’t kw much about them, I do something called a review of systems. We all do. We learn this in medical school. And it’s a checklist    of what is going on in your body. TRUMP: Okay. OZ: I’ll walk through these questions if it’s okay. We start with the head. So, have you ever had head or neck issues, neurologic problems, strokes, headaches? TRUMP: No. OZ: Any problems with     TRUMP: Do we have water around here? Here. OZ: Water. TRUMP: No. The answer is no. I’ve had, I mean, no, no problem. OZ: Hormone problems like thyroid issues? TRUMP: No. OZ: Blood sugar problems? TRUMP: No. OZ: Diabetes? Any heart problems? TRUMP: No. OZ: I know you’re on Lipitor. TRUMP: Yeah, I take a statin. I don’t know if I should mention the name. I would, but    OZ: You don’t have to. TRUMP: And actually I’ve experimented with three statins. And one seems, for me, to work the best. And it’s really brought my cholesterol down into a good range. OZ: How long have you been on it? TRUMP: Couple of years, I would say. Couple of years. OZ: Lung complaints, asthma, wheezing? TRUMP: No, nothing. Really nothing. It’s been    people are amazed because I don’t get much with the colds. Sometimes in the spring or in the fall, I’ll get a little hay fever. And that comes and goes. Actually I don’t know why this would be. It used to be worse when I was young. Maybe it’s given up on me. OZ: Yeah. TRUMP: But when I was young, it could be pretty rough, the hay fever. But very, very little now. I don’t know if that’s something that you’re not that surprised at, but the hay fever is not very bad. But that would be about the only thing. I haven’t had a cold in a long time. Years. OZ: Stomach problems, intestine issues, reflux, diverticulitis? TRUMP: No. OZ: Bladder or prostate issues? I saw the one letter released had a low PSA. TRUMP: My PSA has been very good. I don’t know what’s going on, but so many of my friends are having problems where they’re getting the operation or they’re going for radiation. And it’s always the first number I ask for. I say give me that number. I want to know, and my number’s been    as you say it’s been a very good number. OZ: Any history of personal cancer? TRUMP: No, none whatsoever. OZ: Skin issues? TRUMP: No, very little. Probably you could say    I try and stay out of the sun for the most part. I wear a hat. I play golf. And I wear a hat. But I’ve had no problem    no major problem    but certainly no problem with skin. OZ: Blood clots or any other blood problems? TRUMP: No. No. OZ: Let me turn to the family history. TRUMP: I have to be very boring for you. OZ: No, no. TRUMP: This is going to be very boring. OZ: It’s what I do as a doctor. TRUMP: I would tell you  —   You know, my wife is a big fan of your show, and I would absolutely say because I view this as in a way going to see my doctor. Just a little bit public. That’s all. [applause] OZ: Let me ask you if I can about family history. I’m most concerned with problems that happened before your parents or other relatives were younger than 65 years of age. TRUMP: Okay. OZ: Any dementia or Alzheimer’s? TRUMP: No. My father had    he was close to 94 years old, and the last few years he developed    we probably think it was Alzheimer’s, which was very hard for us because he was such a smart guy, such a wonderful guy and, you know, that’s a rough thing. Physically he was unbelievable. His heart was powerful. Wouldn’t stop. I mean, it wouldn’t stop. And he lived to a very old age and was really great right up toward the end. My mother was mentally unbelievable and she actually had an accident. She would have lived well into her 90’s. She was close to 90 but, but she would have lived well into her 90’s. Her family even    this is many years ago    but her family would routinely go into the high 90’s. OZ: Any history among other relatives of cancer or heart disease at a young age? TRUMP: No, none. OZ: When was the last time that you had a regular physical exam? TRUMP: Well, I try and do it every year. I’ve had the same doctor for a long time. And some would say why don’t you change? I said, you know, I’ve been lucky. I’m here. Are we a little superstitious? I’m not looking to find some genius and all of a sudden I    I just want    I have a very good doctor. I think he’s been    he’s done a really good job for me. He is a member of Lenox Hill hospital, respected person. I went to him on Friday, and I had a test. And I just got the  —   I literally just got the results. OZ: Of your medical test. TRUMP: Of my medical test. OZ: This is with Dr. Bornstein? TRUMP: Dr. Bornstein, yeah. Respected guy. Good guy, and I’ve been with him a long time. A lot of people say you could change doctors. I just say you know what? I’ve been with him probably over 30 years. I think the last thing I want to do is switch doctors. [COMMERCIAL] OZ: If your health is as strong as it seems from your review of systems, why not share your medical records? TRUMP: I have really no problem in doing it. I have it right here. Should I do it? I don’t care. [applause] It’s two letters. One is the report, and the other is from Lenox Hill hospital. OZ: May I see them? These are the reports from    TRUMP: Those were all the tests just done last week. OZ: September 13, 2016. Again, from Dr. Bornstein. It says  —   I’m going to say this is a  —   first of all, thank you for sharing this. This is a pretty comprehensive    can I read it to you real quickly, and I’ll try to quickly interpret it? TRUMP: Sure. OZ: Cholesterol  —   we have 6’3,” 236 pounds. Cholesterol is 169. The HDL, which is healthy cholesterol, 63. The lousy LDL cholesterol is 94. Those are good numbers. Triglycerides are good  —   that’s the amount of fat in your blood. The PSA, like the other let published before, is 0. 15, which is very low. Blood pressure116 over 70. Blood sugar, 99. TRUMP: That’s good. 116 over 70. OZ: Yeah, I mean. TRUMP: I’ve always been lucky with blood pressure. I’ve always had very good blood pressure. OZ: Blood sugar, 99. And   protein also low. Your liver function, your thyroid functional is all normal. You had a colonoscopy performed July 10, 2013, which was normal with no polyps. Calcium score and your heart, 2013, also was low at 98. Oh my goodness. EKG chest   on April 14 was normal. A normal echocardiogram was done two years ago. And your testosterone’s 441, which is actually    it’s good. It’s good. [applause] You’re only on the statin drug you mentioned. If a patient of mine had these records, I’d be really happy. And I’d send them on their way. TRUMP: That’s good. OZ: I must say, I would have shared this earlier. Why didn’t you blast this out? TRUMP: I didn’t think it was necessary, you know, the public has known me for a long time. They’ve never seen me in a hospital. Okay? One thing if I’m in a hospital it’s going to be out there, big league. I had my appendix out when I was 11, and that was the last time I was in a hospital. That was a   deal. So I’ve spent basically one night in a hospital. You know, I’m very fortunate in that respect. But genetically    I think you’re probably a believer in that, a lot of people say that is sort of the most important thing    my parents lived very long lives. My mother’s family was amazing because everybody over in Scotland, everybody was into their 90s, late 90s    I mean, beyond. And my father, very similar. A little bit different, but very similar. So my parents lived very long lives. And good lives, too. They’re great people, but good lives. OZ: I thank you for sharing this. It does help address some of the comments about the candidates’ health, which I think in this modern era people expect to know enough about the people we’re voting for to know that they’re safe. So I am appreciative. TRUMP: Well, I do feel the question is often asked: Should you show it? It’s very private. It is all very private stuff. Should you be showing it? I think when you’re running for president of the United States, or maybe any other country, in all fairness, but when you’re running for president, I think you have an obligation to be healthy. I just don’t think you can do the work if you’re not healthy. I don’t think you can represent the country properly if you’re not a healthy person. And, you know, I’ve been going around    I started this journey for president on June 16, and since then I probably have taken off like almost no days. I’ve been going from state to state, from city to city. So in a certain way I get a lot of exercise    ore than most people would think. OZ: Besides golf, is that your major exercise? TRUMP: Yeah. I don’t play much golf, though, lately. We have a president who plays so much golf he could be on the PGA tour. [laughter] OZ: Let’s focus    no, no. We’ll focus on Mr. Trump. We’ll focus on you. Let’s talk about stamina. You use that word a lot. You made it an issue in this campaign. You argue a president has to have a tremendous amount of stamina. If elected at age 70, you will be the oldest person to ever enter the oval office. Why do you think you have the stamina for the job? TRUMP: Just about the same age as Ronald Reagan. And Hillary is a year behind me. I would say just based on my life. I actually    and I don’t know if this makes sense    I feel as good today as I did when I was 30. And you mentioned golf, because I’ve been a good golfer over the years. I won a lot of club championships and things. And that’s a good mentality because to win a club championship you have to be very strong up here. And when I play golf, I feel that I’m maybe a better golfer today than I was 15, 20 years ago. I don’t know what it is. I hit the ball as far. Now maybe the equipment is a little bit better. I always say the equipment is better, the muscles are a little bit worse. Whatever it is. I hit the ball as far. I hit the ball better. I putt just as well. That has to do with the hands. You can’t have problems with hand movement, if you’re going to be a good putter. But just as an indication, I think I’m a better player today than I was 15, 20, 30 years ago. OZ: When do you wake up in the morning? TRUMP: But I don’t get to play very much anymore. OZ: When you look into the mirror, how old is the person you are looking at? What do you see? TRUMP: I would say I see a person that’s 35 years old. [applause] I mean, I feel    I feel the same. I mean, Tom Brady is a friend of mine. We play golf together, the great quarterback. He’s a phenomenal guy, great athlete, and I’m with him, and I feel the same age as him. It’s crazy. OZ: How many hours a night do you sleep? What is your sleep life? TRUMP: I never needed much sleep. But I’ve always said that is a function of do you enjoy life. I don’t know if that makes sense to you. Like you love what you do? I love what I do. I’m even loving politically what I do. I’m having a lot of fun. It’s a lot of work but I love    it’s called Make America great Again. I love what we’re doing. I love this movement that’s been created. Many of the big political commentators have said this is the single greatest political event they’ve ever seen  —   you know, what’s happened with this whole trump thing. And really it’s not me. It’s like I’m the messenger. It’s the movement    where you say a day before that you’re going to be in Charlotte, North Carolina, and 20, 000 people show up and pack an arena, and they have to turn away 10. OZ: But there is a lot of stress. TRUMP: Well I don’t find stress. I find that if I go to    let’s say somebody said, and I’m fortunate because I have a wonderful wife that understands me, and she’ll say, you don’t want to go on vacation. She’d like to go on vacation, by the way, but she’s not selfish. But I find that if I go on a vacation, it’s like that’s more stress to me, because I want to get back. And if I go on a vacation where they don’t have phones? I did that once 20 years ago. I went on a vacation where the phones were, like, one of these things where you’re not supposed to make phone calls and you weren’t able to make phone calls. And I lasted about a day and a half. I said, let’s get out of here. This is terrible. OZ: But if running for president and running a company or companies doesn’t cause you stress, what does? Something has to    TRUMP: I think running for president causes more stress    you know, I built a great company, I have an unbelievable company. And that hasn’t been stressful over the last, you know, number of years. Now when you’re building it it’s more stress and everything else and you’re always   and you’re fighting with banks. But now it’s become just a great, great company. And so there’s not stress there. I think running for president is. One of the reasons is the media is so dishonest. They come up with stories that aren’t true, and you try and knock the hell out of the story and you’re always fighting. OZ: Do you get angry about that? Anger and hostility has significant health consequences. How do you cope with that? How do you get past it? TRUMP: I fight back. OZ: Not with the press, but with anything. TRUMP: It’s a great question. I don’t think it matters that much. OZ: What doesn’t matter? TRUMP: You saw the polls. The polls are really    especially over the last week    the polls have been believable. And I’ll tell you what: In theory, if it mattered I wouldn’t be leading nationally. CNN just came up with a poll where I’m up two nationally. OZ: If what didn’t matter? TRUMP: If the press mattered so much. It’s amazing. It doesn’t matter as much like it used to matter. OZ: So what type of temperament is required for the person who becomes president of the United States? TRUMP: Unbelievable strong and smart temperament, and I think it’s my grandest asset. I think temperament is my single greatest asset. OZ: Why do so many people question your temperament? TRUMP: They don’t question  —   it’s Madison Avenue. Madison Avenue went to Hillary Clinton and they said    and when I say Madison Avenue, I’m talking about the advertising people, the people that make up the ads. And they said, let’s see, and they put 15 things on a board. ‘Oh, temperament. Let’s go after temperament.’ The people that know me    I win. I know how to win. You can’t win unless you have a great temperament. I know people that can’t win. I know people that are very talented at sports, and they never win. [applause] OZ: Making a decision under pressure is the most important part probably of a president’s job description. How do you prepare yourself for those big decisions? TRUMP: Well, I think I’ve been prepared. That’s what I do. That’s what my whole life is. The big decision was when I decided to run on June 16. I’ve never done this before. They had one    I think it was sort of funny, because I was about five or six months into the campaign when I was going for are the nomination. You know, I was against 17 people    mostly senators, governors, all of the highest level of their profession. And I came in, and they said that I had five months’ experience, and they had 219 years    in other words when you added it all up. So people would say based on that how do you win? And I ended up winning. Winning, I’m so happy to say, with the highest number of votes in the history of the Republican Party. There’s never been anybody. OZ: When I graduated from medical school, I took an oath to do no harm. Do you have an oath or mantra that you repeat back to yourself? TRUMP: No, I don’t repeat it back to myself, but I tell you my theme and what I’m living for now is making America great again. That’s what I want to do. I want to make America great again. OZ: We’ll be right back with our very special guest. [COMMERCIAL] [SEGMENT WITH IVANKA TRUMP ON CHILD CARE PROPOSAL] . .. OZ: I consider women the chief health officer of the family. It’s another additional responsibility    sort of discussed [unintelligible]. And I wonder if I can turn to their health, because they’re the caregivers. They’re the last ones to get health. Coverage for basic screening is challenge which we’re going to have to tackle. But let me talk to my candidate about a big topic that comes up all the time, which is birth control. Do you think it should be mandated in this country that we reimburse women for their birth control? TRUMP: I think what we have in birth control is, you know, when you have to get a prescription, that’s a pretty tough something to climb. And I would say it should not be a prescription. It should not be done by prescription. You have women that just aren’t in a position to go get a prescription. And more and more people are coming out and saying that, but I am not in favor of prescription for birth control. OZ: What is your stand on abortion today? TRUMP: I am  . OZ: And there is a misconception    that I think you would argue anyway    about the views that you have on women. And this comes up a lot. Why do you think there is such a discussion going on now about that problem? TRUMP: I don’t know. You know, it’s very interesting. Because I just think, look, I have such respect for women. My mother was one of the great people I’ve of known in my life. I just think that somehow I have a narrative out there    you know, when you have hundreds of millions of dollars spent on you in advertising, okay, on advertising, on false advertising in many cases, but negative hit jobs, you know, I guess maybe  —   OZ: You have said unkind things about women. Do you regret those? TRUMP: It depends what you’re talking about. I’ll give you an example: When I’m having fun, when I was never going to be a politician. I decided a year and a half ago, let’s do it to straighten out country, because the country is a mess. But before that had I known I was going to be a politician    Howard Stern is a friend of mine    I wouldn’t have done his show. We have fun. We have fun. A lot of people understand that. We have fun. So we’ll talk about women. We’ll talk about men. We’ll talk about everything, and we’re all having a good time. Now if I ever as running for president, I wouldn’t have done the show, or I would have given him very boring answers. We’re all having fun together. IVANKA TRUMP: I do think there is a bit of a false narrative on this out there, though    In that my father speaks his mind, so whether it’s a man or a woman, if you attack him he’ll attack you back. In a certain way, it would be strange if he handled women and men differently. so he can be a little rough with people once in a while, but it is often that they’re coming at you first, almost always that they’re coming at you first. TRUMP: I like to be nice to people, but sometimes people aren’t nice to me. OZ: All right. [applause] IVANKA TRUMP: But I think one of the things that is the ultimate testament is his track record of employing women at the highest levels, long before it was popular to do so. And he’s been doing it for 30 years. I mean, I grew up seeing some of the most amazing female role models at the trump organization doing what were very much considered at the time men’s jobs. They were in construction. They were in development. People weren’t in those positions, and he was giving them an opportunity to. There are women all over the city who are testament to, who are now very successful, have companies that are incredibly   that rose through the ranks and learned their trades through my father. So I have a tough time with that narrative because his long track record of supporting, advocating for women and promoting women is    speaks for itself. OZ: I thank you very much for doing the show. [COMMERCIAL] OZ: Back with Mr. Trump. We’ll talk about some of the   health issues facing this country. First up: addiction. Just this week, this picture shocked our nation. Two parents slumped over from a heroin overdose with their    son in the back seat of the car. Mr. Trump, you said publicly that we are losing the war on drugs badly. TRUMP: Totally. Totally. OZ: How do we turn this around? TRUMP: We have to stop it at the border. It is coming in mostly through, as you know, the southern border. It’s pouring in. And we’re going to have to do something. I was just given the endorsement by 16, 500 border patrol agents. They say you’re going to be the only one that’s going to stop it. Hillary  —   well, I won’t get involved in politics but  —   OZ: You’ve been so good. TRUMP: I’ve done very well. [laughter] TRUMP: But she won’t do it. But I will tell you we need to have strong borders. It’s just pouring in. You know, it’s less expensive than candy. You go to the store, you want to buy candy    you can buy heroin in some places for less. I go to New Hampshire. I go to Pennsylvania. I go to different places. It’s the biggest    Ohio is having such a problem. We’re going to have to have very, very strong borders, and we’re going to have to stop it, because it is poisoning our youth. It’s worse than it’s ever been. I mean, you have cities where they have overdoses    25 and 30 overdoses a week, and some of them last weekend a certain city    I won’t mention which one    22 people died in one weekend. OZ: So should it be a criminal problem or a medical problem? TRUMP: Everything. It is every kind of a problem but certainly a criminal problem for the people that bring it in. OZ: May I ask a personal question? I know your brother Fred and you’ve talked about him. TRUMP: Yes. OZ: Was an alcoholic. Died at a very young age, 43. And I understand you don’t drink. TRUMP: I don’t drink. OZ: So how has having an addiction in your family informed or shaped your view on addiction? TRUMP: I had a great brother named Fred. He was a very handsome guy, the life of the party. Just this incredible guy. Probably around college time he started drinking a little bit and then a little bit more and a little bit more. And he really destroyed his life. He was so incredible. He had everything you could want. The best looking, the best personality. He had everything. Smart. But I watched and he would tell me, he knew he had a problem. I was quite a bit younger than him. He would tell me, no drugs, no alcohol. But see in those days, it wasn’t drugs. But he would say, no drugs, no alcohol. He would really focus on the alcohol, because that was very much early in the drug cycle. I don’t know how drugs were in those days. OZ: Much less. TRUMP: But he would say    and then I would see he also smoked, and I would say smoking. I always say    I tell my kids no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. But the world is so competitive that if you’re stuck on drugs or alcohol, you’re not going to be able to compete. It’s going to be a disaster. And you know, it potentially can ruin your life. OZ: All right. So if elected you’ve argued that the Affordable Care Act can no longer be in place. You would repeal it. What can you put in its place that can ensure we don’t have a lot of folks who currently have coverage who would otherwise lose it? TRUMP: Well, Obamacare as it’s called is really having a hard time. Okay? Insurance companies are leaving on a daily basis. They can’t do it. Premiums are through the roof. You look at the premiums, in Texas through Blue Cross Blue Shield it’s gone up 60 percent. And 60 percent is going to be low compared to some of the numbers. A lot of the big numbers will be coming out before the election. They’re trying to have the date moved till after the election. Would be very unfair because this is  . It’s a disaster. We have to come up, and we can come up with many different plans. In fact, plans you don’t even know about will be devised because we’re going to come up with plans,    health care plans    that will be so good. And so much less expensive both for the country and for the people. And so much better. With Obamacare, the deductible I don’t know if you’ve seen what’s gone on with the deductible. The deductible’s so high that unless you die a very vicious, horrible, catastrophic death, and it lasts a long time, you’re not going to get to use it because it’s crazy. It’s so high. Again, such a high barrier. We have to come up with a plan, a private plan other than for those that can’t do that. We have to help them, too. OZ: So what do we do with the folks who fall through the cracks? TRUMP: We have to go and help them through the medicaid system. We have to help them publicly. We’re going to have to do it. Nobody wants to see people    and it’s totally unfair    a lot of people said oh, gee that’s not the thing to say. I said, well you know what? If I can’t say that, I’m not running for office. There are people who say everybody should have a great, wonderful, private plan, and if you can’t afford that, and there is a percentage, a fairly large percentage that can’t afford it, then those people don’t get taken care of. That’s wrong. We’re going to take care of that through the Medicaid system. We’re going to take care of those people. We have no choice. We’re not going to let people die on the streets. But we will have competition that will be so strong for people’s business  —   Now, one thing you have to do is get rid of the monopolies. Because every state has a line wrapped around it. You know, they’d rather have the insurance companies and the various companies    they’d rather have one state where they’re by themselves than be able to bid all over the United States. You understand that. We have to get rid of the lines. We have to have competition. And we will have, you will have plans that you don’t even know about right now. They’ll get better and better and better, and they’ll get cheaper and cheaper, and it’ll be a beautiful thing to see. But right now Obamacare is not affordable by the country and it’s not affordable by people. OZ: You mentioned you don’t want people dying in the streets. So what if an undocumented immigrant collapses and needs   therapy? Do we have a moral responsibility, do you believe, to help that person? TRUMP: Well, under my plan the undocumented or as you would say illegal immigrant wouldn’t be in the country. They only come in the country legally. [applause] OZ: We’ll be right back. [COMMERCIAL] OZ: I’m still processing this letter, because I didn’t know we would get it. But you’re 6’3,” 236 pounds as I mentioned. In my mind I’m thinking your body surface area and your BMI Is high. It’s probably close to 30, which is sort of the barrier for most people. TRUMP: Okay. OZ: Do your doctors or family ever give you a hard time about your weight? TRUMP: Yeah. I think I could lose a little weight. I’ve always been a little bit this way. You know? I’ve sort of always been that. Probably a good swimmer, but I’ve always been this way. I think that, yeah. If I had one thing I’d like to lose weight. It’s tough because of the way I live. But the one thing I would like to do is be able to drop 15, 20 pounds. It would be good. OZ: So you very kindly offered to take questions from our audience. TRUMP: Sure. OZ: That still okay? TRUMP: Sure. OZ: If I can get a hand mic. Go ahead. AUDIENCE: Hi. Mr. Trump, I am a teacher and I see obesity every day. How would you go about handling the obesity problem in the country    especially among children    and the fact that many schools are not providing enough exercise in recess time? TRUMP: That is a school thing to a certain extent. I guess you could say it’s a hereditary thing, too. I would imagine it certainly is a hereditary thing. But a lot of schools aren’t providing proper food because they have budget problems, and they’re buying cheaper food and not as good of food. And the big thing    when I went to school I always loved sports, and I would always    I loved to eat and I loved sports, and it worked, because I could do both. A lot of schools today they don’t have sports programs and that is a big problem. I would try and open that up. I’m a big believer in the whole world of sports. I would try and open that up. [applause] OZ: Nicole, go ahead. AUDIENCE: Hello, Mr. Trump. Do you believe the intolerance and prejudices that citizens of this country are spewing back and forth to each other are healthy and will this have an effect on the country’s mental health? TRUMP: I think it is very unhealthy, and I think it’s very bad. We really have to come together as a country. No. The    there is a great division. There’s no question about it. I’m sure you see it, too. We will come together as a country. [applause] OZ: Thank you very much for coming on the show. Thanks for spending time with our audience. Mr. Donald Trump."
"         Donald Trump is a man on his heels. And as both voters and members of his own party start to desert him, he’s increasingly prone to lash out. He has now suggested that he would put Hillary Clinton in jail as president and is going after Bill Clinton’s indiscretions as hard as ever, following a Washington Post report of a 2005 video in which he made extremely lewd and sexually aggressive comments about women. Trump wasn’t able to drive home his Clinton attacks too much during Sunday night’s debate, but in the friendlier confines of his rallies Monday, he let loose. Below is the annotated transcript from his appearance in Ambridge, Pa.  —   his first rally since the debate and since The Post released the lewd video on Friday. To see annotations, click on the highlighted yellow text. To make your own, make sure you have a Genius account.  TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we love Big Ben. Big Ben’s a friend. (APPLAUSE) We play golf together. He once hit a shot that went head (ph) right into a tree. It was a massive tree like this. The ball hit the tree so hard, I swear I said, Ben, within two years, that’s tree’s going to be dead. And you know what? Two years later, he’s shooting the same. It’s because we have (inaudible) here. (LAUGHTER) But two years later, that tree was dead. (LAUGHTER) He is a strong guy, and he’s good guy too. Big Ben. (APPLAUSE) So I’m thrilled to be back in Pennsylvania. Great place. I went to school in Pennsylvania. November 8th, we’re going to win this state, and we’re going to win back the White House. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to take on the special interests, the corrupt media  —   and it is corrupt  —   and the career politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth and stolen our middle class. They’ve stolen our middle class. We’re going to make Pennsylvania rich again by bringing back our jobs. We’ll bring back our jobs. (APPLAUSE) And Hillary Clinton doesn’t have a clue about how to bring back jobs, that I can tell you (inaudible). She doesn’t have a clue. If she wanted to, she couldn’t do it. You know, in New York state, she ran for the Senate. And you know what, the state New York is a disaster for jobs. And she said, “I’m going to bring back 200, 000 jobs. ” Guess what? Right down the tubes, worse today than ever before. How many have watched the debate last night? (APPLAUSE) Good (inaudible). We had a lot of fun. And I would say that Hillary is highly overrated. (APPLAUSE) It was fun watching (inaudible). I mean, most of us (inaudible) unanimous decisions. But some of these people, they were so pain  —   it was like a painful experience. But we’re fighting for you, so what’s good for me is good for you. And I mean that totally 100 percent. (APPLAUSE) And we’re going to talk about a lot of things today, but I always want you to remember this above all else. We’re going to bring back the jobs to Pennsylvania. We’re going to bring back steel. Your steel has been stolen from you in this area. (APPLAUSE) Natural gas, the EPA is killing you and killing your companies and you’re losing your jobs. Let me tell you, that’s going to turned around on day one if I win. On day one. Your jobs are coming back to Pennsylvania, and they’re coming back to this area. And that means we’re going to take care of our steelworkers and we’re going to take care of our miners, believe me. I’m going to take care of you. (APPLAUSE) We laid out a goal, uplifting vision for America. Lower taxes, better trade deals  —   I’ll give you a purse (ph). (LAUGHTER) And millions and millions of new jobs. But all crooked Hillary can do was talk about small, petty things last night. During the course of 90 minutes, she was exposed and her values were exposed. She had no defense. All she could do was lie. She lied so much last night. They don’t like to catch her on the lies. I explained how Hillary Clinton oversaw the disasters in Libya, including the drawing of the infamous red line. Remember she said, oh, I had nothing  —   well, it turned out she was there, by the way. Remember, she said she wasn’t there? (BOOING) The red line was actually drawn in August of 2012. No, she was there. She lied about it. She said she wasn’t involved in that catastrophe. But that was just one of many. Of course, the moderators didn’t call her out and they didn’t call out this lie that she told. Hillary Clinton said she didn’t delete her emails after a congressional subpoena. But she did. That was another lie. That was a hard one to believe. How did she say no to that one? The subpoena  —   well, the subpoena was sent on March 4, 2015. Crooked Hillary’s emails were bleached and destroyed. Now, nobody bleaches them. You know what? Bleaching is so expensive. It’s really a very expensive process. But when you bleach them, it pretty much means they’re gone. Although I’ve always heard you can’t get rid of emails. I’ve been told you can’t. I wonder if the NSA has her emails, do you think? AUDIENCE: Yeah! TRUMP: Do you think? I don’t think they looked too hard for her emails. What do you think, folks? Do you think  —   I don’t know. AUDIENCE: Lock her up! TRUMP: I’ll tell you, I bet  —   I don’t know this for a fact, but I’ll bet within the FBI  —   you know, you have some of the greatest Americans in the world that are so proud of the FBI  —   and I’ll bet you they are sick to their stomachs at what’s happening. Sick to their stomachs. (APPLAUSE) Anyway, her emails were destroyed somewhere between March 25th and March 31st after the congressional subpoena was received. You know, if you are suing somebody privately and they delete and get rid of all your stuff that you subpoena, you got a very big consequence. You know what the consequence is, right? Here’s  —   here’s the United States Congress  —   United States Congress subpoenaing to see emails and other things and they’re gone. And now, by the way, did you read yesterday? Two boxes of emails and materials are now missing. AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! TRUMP: Very, very sad. Special prosecutor, here we come, right? (APPLAUSE) If I win, we’re going to appoint a special prosecutor because we cannot allow this to happen to our country. We can’t. We’re like a   nation. Hillary had no defense for her contract (ph) and didn’t even try to defend the ridiculous (inaudible) that these were 30, 000 emails about yoga and wedding planning. (BOOING) Let’s see. You have 30, 000  —   33, 000 emails deleted, right? I would bet she had three for yoga and maybe five for the wedding, right? What about the rest? She had no defense when I brought up her failures in Iraq, Syria and Libya. She had no defense when I brought up her failures as a senator from New York promising to create the 200, 000 jobs for upstate New York. But instead, the jobs were shipped to Mexico and other countries. She had no defense for calling on millions of Americans and then saying that they were deplorable  —   that’s you, deplorable. That’s me, it’s all of us. And you know what’s worse? Irredeemable. I don’t know, which is worse? Would you rather be deplorable? Irredeemable means you have no chance, right? We’re deplorable and irredeemable. I don’t think so. I think we have the greatest people on Earth. The smartest people. (APPLAUSE) We have the smartest. We have the most loyal people. That’s one thing every poll points out that, boy, Trump’s people, it’s like the most loyal ever. (APPLAUSE) And one thing I know, we’re going to get out and vote and we’re going to be voting. And you remember the primaries. Donald Trump is behind, voting begins tomorrow, should be very interesting, but it looks like Mr. Trump will not be able to win this state, but he’s put up a good fight. Next day, Donald Trump wins by 22 points. Everyone. .. (APPLAUSE) Crazy deal. Mr. Brexit, Mr. Brexit. Remember I said Brexit’s going to happen because I have a lot of property over there. Brexit’s going to happen. They all laughed. They said Donald Trump said that Brexit’s going to happen. Isn’t he ridiculous? Anyway, three days later, they vote, Brexit happens. They never say anything. They never said anything. TRUMP: But that’s all right. This is like Brexit, folks. You watch. We want our independence back. We want our borders strong. We don’t want people coming in from Syria that we have no idea who the hell they are. (APPLAUSE) As I said last night  —   and I mean this  —   she’s got hatred in her heart. She wants to divide America. I want to bring us together as one people. (APPLAUSE) And by the way, we have thousands and thousands of people outside. You know, that, right? Do you know how lucky you are? Do you know how lucky you are? (APPLAUSE) And I guess they’re not allowing them in. I don’t know why because there’s thousands of people. Where is the fire marshal? Let some more people come in, I see some seats over there. Let some people  —   fire marshal, we need your help. (APPLAUSE) Where’s our fire marshal? Let them come in. We’ve got 3, 000 or 4, 000 people standing out there. See, I guess they figure you folks are taking the seats in the very back. We ought to let some more people come in. (APPLAUSE) I always get a kick  —   I mean, I know a lot about fire and fire marshals, but you have a room with four walls and a roof and nothing to burn. Let the people in. (APPLAUSE) Hillary also had no defense for Obamacare, which is a total disaster. I’m going to repeal and replace your disastrous Obamacare. Much cheaper, much better. (APPLAUSE) Hillary had no defense for her secret speeches to Wall Street and international banks that she hid from the public and which were exposed by WikiLeaks. And by the way, just as I’m walking on the stage, Mayor Giuliani said you’re not going to believe this, look at this, we have all of these new charges. You see it just came down today. WikiLeaks, some new stuff, some brutal stuff. I mean, I’d read it to you, but to hell with it, just trust me. It’s real bad stuff. (APPLAUSE) The speech transcripts contain scandalous revelations about Hillary Clinton that disqualify her from seeking public office. (APPLAUSE) And she is. She’s disqualified just on the fact that she did that with her emails. Think of it; deleting 33, 000  —   think of it. How can you do it? These transcripts also shine a spotlight on how this corrupt establishment works, where politicians meet in secret with the big banks, collect massive sums of money, then betray the American worker, which is you and me and sort of all of us, we’re all workers. We’re all working, we just work differently. You know, I tell this to people. We have people in this room right now that made more money 18 years ago than they’re making now. They work a lot harder right now than they did 18 years ago. Their job was better 18 years ago and they’re older. And the only thing I say is I’m older also, and I’ve never worked this hard either, folks, I will tell you. That’s for sure. (APPLAUSE) My campaign is powered by my money and also small donations from millions of visitors to our website who just want their country back. They want America back. (APPLAUSE) Last night, I asked Hillary Clinton why she doesn’t take some of the hundreds of millions of dollars that she made (ph)    so I’ll over $100 million into the campaign of my money. Is that smart or is that stupid? AUDIENCE: Smart! TRUMP: Take some of the money she made selling favors to special interest and invest them in her campaign, instead of having to rely on even more corporate donations. She looked like, oh my god, why did he bring this up? She had no answer. She was flabbergasted, I can tell you. In the secret speeches released by WikiLeaks, this is yesterday and the day before, Hillary  —   not as good as today, buy the way  —   Hillary Clinton  —   but I say that because the press will try not to pick them up because they try and protect her. I’ll tell you what, the only thing she’s got going in the media. Without the media, she would not have a chance. (APPLAUSE) Hillary Clinton told her Wall Street donors that you need to have a public position and a private position. In other words, you need to be dishonest to run for office. In other words, have one for the public and one for the people that are giving you the money. Right? And that is very much right in that whole thing. I mean, it’s crazy. How did Hillary Clinton try to defend this shocking admission? She did not deny  —   she said this awful thing. Instead she blamed honest Abe Incon (ph). Honest Abe! (BOOING) So Hillary Clinton for lying, blamed Abe Lincoln, commonly known as honest Abe. He’s spinning in his grave. The speeches also show that crooked Hillary supports cutting Medicare and Social Security benefits, one more example of how Hillary Clinton’s public position is a lie. She wants to knock the hell out of your Social Security, she wants to knock the hell out of your  . And I’m going to save them, okay? This is a little reversal for the   but I am going to save them (ph) because we’re going to make  —   we’re going to make our country rich again. We’re going to bring back our jobs. We’re going to make good trade deals. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to have countries that we are defending all over the world pay a little bit more money, if that is okay. (APPLAUSE) Which, in all fairness, until I came along, you never even heard about that. Right? And then when I say that they say, oh, Trump does not want to defend Japan. No, I’d love to defend, but let them pay a little more money, right, isn’t that good? We’re dying (ph) we’re going to have $20 trillion in debt, $20 trillion. So some of these countries that we do such a good job for, where we defend them  —   and we love doing it, but they got to help us out a little bit. Right? Most shockingly, these speeches show Hillary Clinton saying, quote, my dream is a hemispheric common market (ph) with open trade  —   you know what that does to your community? That’s the end. And open borders! (BOOING) In other words, she wants the United States to surrender to global governance (ph) with no controls over trade or immigration. Great. Can you imagine? Seriously. Can you imagine? She’s saying she’s for NAFTA, which she was. You know, her husband signed NAFTA. But she’s also for   Partnership By the way, NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made in the history  —   not of this country, but of the world. What it’s done to Pennsylvania and Ohio and update New York and New England. Poor New England, what it’s done to New England. So she’s for radical, unlimited immigration. In other words, people are going to pour in (ph) but that’s what she’s for. I’m building a wall, and she’s for, like, come on across. Slight difference. (APPLAUSE) A slight difference. We’re going to build a wall. Who is going to pay for the wall? AUDIENCE: Mexico! TRUMP: By the way, they may not know it yet, but I think they’re getting the idea. But when you think of it, she wants to have people pour across. Now, the border patrol agents, 16, 500, endorsed me recently. And last week. .. (APPLAUSE) Never endorsed a presidential candidate before in long history. And last week, ICE endorsed. ICE is  —   these are great people. These are people that want to do their jobs, but they’re told to stand back, don’t do your job. These are great people. You know, it’d be a lot easier for them if they didn’t endorse me because they could just take it nice and easy. But they want  —   so, we got ICE, we have the border patrol agents, we have Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff. .. (APPLAUSE) And Hillary Clinton’s got nothing. So she wants people to pour across the borders. She wants thousands and thousands of people to come in from Syria. I mean, 550 percent more than our President Obama. (BOOING) A Trump administration will completely renegotiate NAFTA or we will walk away and make a   deal that’s far better where actually businesses start coming to Pennsylvania and to Ohio. (APPLAUSE) Unbelievable. And we will stop the disastrous   Partnership, which would be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing could be as bad. But we’ll stop it. And we’ll make deals. But this is a complex deal with many countries. You have to see the arrows all over the place. Once you sign it, it’s 5, 000 pages, more than that long. Once you sign it, it’s a mess. I like free trade. We make one deal, two deals, three  —   we make it with individual countries, and if they don’t behave, we terminate them. We send them what’s called a notification of termination. (APPLAUSE) But that will never happen because during that   period, we’ll renegotiate a better deal for our country, okay? And you the other way, you can’t terminate. There’s too many  —   it’s  —   people go crazy. You have to be like a grand chessmaster, and we don’t have any of them. Hillary Clinton’s radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all, would end the United States as we know it today. (BOOING) No one who supports open borders should be able to run for president, because we won’t have a country. (APPLAUSE) And by the way, weeks ago, I called out Hillary Clinton for supporting open borders, and the media said I was wrong. Now, I’ve been proven right. Where is the media rushing to correct these false stories? Because in the WikiLeaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody. See, I like free trade, but we want smart trade. It’s got to be  —   it shouldn’t even be called free trade, it should be called smart trade. I don’t like the term free trade. (APPLAUSE) Because free trade, to have it really work, you need really, really smart people negotiating your details. And all these other countries have smart people. For them, it’s important. For us, we have people, they don’t know what they’re doing. No less than Bernie Sanders declared that open borders would be the end of America. Bernie Sanders said open borders means there would be no United States, doing away with the concept of  . Sanders also explained how open borders would make everybody in America poorer by radically reducing wages. Maybe that’s okay with him. Not okay with me. By the way, how many ways can Hillary Clinton betray Bernie Sanders? She really has betrayed him. I mean, look, even if we don’t agree with him, I mean  —   you know, Bernie Sanders would have been a legend. He would have gone down as a legendary figure in history if he didn’t make the deal with the devil. But he made the deal with her, and now he’s just another guy. (APPLAUSE) She attacked his supporters as basement dwellers, she admitted in secret she’s in favor of entitlement cuts and she’s for open borders and open trade. Your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs. Since Bill and Hillary Clinton’s NAFTA and China deals happened. I’m going to stop foreign cheating, the product dumping, which by the way, is killing your steel industry, and in this case has already killed much of your steel industry. How many people agree with me that China  —   because this is such a big steel area, or was  —   we’re gonna bring it back, don’t worry about it. But how many people agree with me that China had so much to do and stupid politicians with the killing of the steel industry in the state of Pennsylvania? (APPLAUSE) Between that and currency manipulation, which they do like grand masters and we do like we’re playing bad games of checkers, we’re going to start making things in America again. And we’re going to start making things in Pennsylvania again. Don’t let them tell you you’re doing well because you’re doing lousy. (APPLAUSE) Pennsylvania steel will build our future and Pennsylvania energy  —   our miners, we’re bringing our miners back  —   will power our future. (APPLAUSE) Congressman, get up there, will you? Do we know our Congressman? Look at this guy. I tell you, they say he was a hell of a (ph) football player. They say he was  —   I don’t know if he’d be so good today. Would you be good today? I don’t know. But he has been such an incredible supporter, and so great, and he’s standing next to my daughter Tiffany who came today. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, Congressman. Thank you. We have such great support in these areas. That includes, though, clean coal, shale oil and natural gas we have to protect. Pennsylvania workers will be hired to do the job. Hillary Clinton would rather give your jobs to people that pour into the country illegally. I explained how she favors a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our land. We have nothing  —   we know nothing about them. And by the way, we all have hearts. We know what’s going on. It’s horrible. When you look at Syria, when you look at the migration. We’ll build safe zones and we’ll get others to pay, like the Gulf states. They have nothing but money and they’re not putting up their fair share. They have nothing but money. They’ll pay. And we’ll lead it, but they’ll pay. (APPLAUSE) I also exposed how Hillary Clinton is personally responsible for the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into the United States. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton refused to make foreign countries take back their own criminal aliens by canceling visas, a duty vested in her by the law. And I must tell you, she refused to use forceful diplomatic action. So we’ll have a killer, and he’ll be from another country, let’s say someplace in South America, and we’ll catch him because our ICE people are great and our border patrol people are amazing, so we’ll catch him. And what happens is we’ll want to bring him back to whatever country that person comes from. This could be a killer, a drug dealer, somebody else, a gang member, the head of a gang. Hillary Clinton would say, “We can’t force him back into that country. ” The hell we can’t. (APPLAUSE) I guarantee you that under my administration, there will not be one bad guy that is not forced back into his country. Not one. There won’t be any. You won’t be reading about it. We will put such pressure on those countries to take these people back. But Hillary Clinton did say  —   I’m sorry Madam Secretary, if you can believe this. This was prior to her naps (ph). I’m sorry, Madam Secretary. But they won’t take this killer back. “Oh, that’s okay. Well, bring him back and let him out on our streets. ” And you know what happens, right? The Remembrance Project. You know what that is, right? The Remembrance  —   these are the most incredible mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers who have lost their loved ones to killers, to killers, illegal immigrants that killed their loved ones. And it’s a sad thing to see, that I can tell you. Her refusal to take such diplomatic action has caused the release of thousands of criminals into our community. One foreign national and convicted killer who should have been sent back to his home country in 2012 was instead set free by Clinton’s watch. Six months after his release, he killed again, murdering a   old beautiful Casey Chadwick. You probably heard about it. In just one single year of Hillary Clinton’s tenure, 2010, nearly 4, 000 convicted criminal aliens were released into American communities because their home countries just said, “No, we’re not taking them back. We’re not taking them back. Yes, we’re supposed to legally. We’re not doing it. ” So we took them. Another revelation from those secret speeches is that Hillary Clinton knew that the State Department and their devices were under threat of hacking, and yet she traveled overseas with her totally insecure telephone. Remember the ones that she banged the hell out of when she wanted to get rid of (ph). .. (LAUGHTER) “No I wasn’t trying to (inaudible).” Who banged their phones. When you throw away your cellphones, does anybody bang them with a hammer? This is still more evidence that she lied to the FBI, just like she lied to Congress. And she lied to us. One more very important issue where I exposed the hypocrisy of Hillary Clinton, and the media, was on Hillary Clinton’s treatment of women. I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate words 12 years ago. Locker room talk, whatever you want to call it. But I said to myself, wait a minute. And I just saw a very inappropriate words, but Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously. One of them said more viciously than he attacked them. If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we’ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things. There are so many of them, folks. You probably saw yesterday, we brought four wonderful women to St. Louis. (APPLAUSE) And honestly, it was both very beautiful and very sad. They really  —   they’ve been trying to get their feelings out for so long and the media wouldn’t take it. One thing with me, the media takes it. Whatever. So they were able to get what they wanted to get out. To quote Juanita Broaddrick, “Hillary Clinton threatened me after Bill Clinton raped me. ” She’s been struggling to get the media to pay attention to her for many, many years. So last night, I decided we would expose the hypocrisy of the Clintons and the media and our politicians to the entire world. (APPLAUSE) As I outlined last night, Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office. He was a predator. Hillary Clinton systematically attacked and discredited the victims of Bill Clinton’s sexual harassment and assault. These things aren’t written by the media, but they’re true. Written by many books. These victims include names like Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James and Cristy Zercher. And there are many, many more. For decades, Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband’s predatory behavior, and instead of trying to stop it, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women. She put even more women in harm’s way and then she goes out and says, “I love women. I’m going to help women. I’m gonna help women. ” She’s a total hypocrite. The hypocrisy of the media and our politicians is hard to believe. They condemn my words, but they ignore and defend the  —   and this is the way it is  —   the reprehensible actions of Hillary and Bill Clinton that have destroyed and hurt so many lives. But perhaps the greatest window into the character of Hillary Clinton can be found in what she did as a lawyer when she was defending a man who raped a    little girl. (BOOING) Desperate to win her case, Hillary Clinton blamed the    victim. Her name was Kathleen Shelton. She was with us yesterday. She was right sitting front row at the debate. As the lawyer for the rapist, Hillary Clinton said the little girl was emotionally unstable and had a quote, “tendency to seek out older men and engage in fantasizing. ” This is  —   Hillary ruined that little girl’s life, destroyed her life, then years later she was recorded laughing about it on videotape. She was laughing at the girl. There’s nothing Hillary Clinton won’t do or say to obtain power, and it’s about time people started to understand that. (APPLAUSE) But the hypocrites in the media don’t want to talk about what Hillary Clinton has done to these victims. They don’t want to talk about what their other political heroes have done to other innocent girls and women. People like Kennedy, Chappaquiddick. We remember that. Driving his car into a pond instead of calling the police, possibly saving her life. In fact, almost definitely being able to save her life. He went home and went to sleep. Did not report the incident to the police for 10 hours, yet he was hailed as a hero. TRUMP: The last 72 hours has framed what this election is all about. It’s about the American people fighting back against corrupt politicians who don’t care about anything except staying in power and keeping their donors happy. (APPLAUSE) What I want to say to every American right now is that I accept the mantle of this responsibility for all of us, for all of us. (APPLAUSE) We have an absolute incredible situation taking place, folks. And I will never stop fighting for you against the Washington establishment that has betrayed each and every one of you, betrayed the country. Our government has lost its virtue. Right now, it’s just about protecting the powerful, and you know what I mean. And I know it better than anybody else. And I’m doing this because I just think it’s so damn unfair. (APPLAUSE) And it’s ultimately going to lead to the destruction of our country. And we’re doing it. The Clintons have corrupted our government at the very highest levels. Rank and file  —   incredible people by the way, incredible people  —   rank and file FBI agents are shocked at the corruption that they’re witnessing at levels of the FBI that nobody would have thought it was possible. The Department of Justice, where Bill Clinton gets into the back of an airplane for 39 minutes just prior to a determination being made. Of course, you and I know the determination was made a long time ago. But gets on with the attorney general because he happened to be in Arizona playing golf. It was 110 degrees out, right? Nobody saw him on the golf course. Just happened to be there. Oh, there’s the attorney general. Let me get back on the plane. So they spend 39 minutes in the back of the plane. They talked about two things; golf and grandchildren.   minutes. So I give the grandchildren five minutes, I give the golf three minutes, right? What else do you think might have been talked about? They can’t believe, these FBI people, these people for life in the FBI  —   these are people that are unbelievable people. They love this country so much. And they’re seeing things that they’ve never seen before where guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, no charge, no problem. They see all of this stuff going on and these people much be sick to their stomachs. What have we seen in the email scandal? What have we seen in    corruption? This is really what it is. It’s    —   we’re like in a   country right now. And this November is our one chance, November 8th, our one chance to save our country. It’s the last chance we’re going to have, folks. (APPLAUSE) I’ve traveled around this country talking about change. But my travels, the places I’ve been, the people I’ve met, they’ve also changed me. I’m not proud of everything that I’ve done in life. I mean, who among us is? Is anybody totally proud of every single element? Some we are. But let me tell you what I’m very proud of. I’m proud that I’ve always treated the   worker  —   and I consider myself in a certain way to be a   worker  —   that make this country run with tremendous respect. The waiters and waitresses, the cops and firefighters, the receptionist and the custodians, we treat them with dignity and respect. These are great people. These are great people. (APPLAUSE) And our police and   officials, we have to be thankful for them because they have done an amazing job. (APPLAUSE) I’m proud of the tens of thousands of jobs that I’ve created, and I’m proud that I provide equal play and equal pay for equal work. And I have to do that, I have to do that. I’ve promoted women to the highest positions in my companies over the years, and they have done an incredible job. I’m proud of our unbelievable movement, because that’s what we have is a movement. Men and women who only want a better future for their children. That’s what they want, that’s what we want. (APPLAUSE) I know that if my father and my mother were alive today, they would be very, very proud of me, and they’d be proud of everybody in this room and all of the other stadiums and all of the other rooms that we’re in. We have the greatest people in the world. The greatest people. And we are going to make America great again. And it’s going to happen fast too, I can tell you. (APPLAUSE) My parents knew what was in my heart. They would know the love that I have for all the   people in this country and the love that I have for my country itself. I’m glad that I have the chance today to open my heart to all of you and tell you how much I want to make our country so much better, so much stronger, so much safer, so much wealthier. We have to do all of those things. A woman came up to me and said, Mr. Trump, please, sir, leave out wealthy; it doesn’t sound good. I said, can I use rich instead? Rich. No, no, that doesn’t sound good. I said, here’s the problem, countries all over the world are ripping off the United States. They’re taking our wealth, they’re taking our jobs, they’re taking our future. We have no choice. We want to save our Social Security and our Medicare and our Medicaid. We want to save our wealth. We want to keep our taxes as low as possible. Right now, they’re far too high. Our taxes are going to be cut massively by me, if I get in. And Hillary’s going to raise taxes. (APPLAUSE) Our regulations, which are killing our companies, are going to be cut massively by me. And I’ll tell you what. You look at your energy companies, your natural gas, your coal companies, your steel companies, they can’t do business, they can’t compete with the rest of the world because the regulations are so horrible and so massive. So we’re going to cut taxes. Hillary’s going to raise taxes. We’re going to cut taxes big league for the middle class, big league for business. We’re going to grow again. Companies aren’t going to be leaving our shores. They’re not going to be leaving us for Mexico and other places. We’re going to have companies coming back and new companies being formed. It’s going to happen very quickly. (APPLAUSE) My whole life I’ve been a fighter, and now I’m going to fight for you. We’re going to fight. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to bring back our military. You know, our military needs enhancement. It’s so depleted. We’re going to fight for our veterans who are being horribly mistreated, not taken care of properly. In many cases, illegal immigrants are being taken care of much better than our veterans. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to fight for our Second Amendment, which is under siege. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to take care of that one easily. We’re going to fight to have Supreme Court justices that believe in our Constitution appointed to the Supreme Court. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to fight for all of our businesses, but we’re going to fight for the steel businesses that have been taken away from us. We’re going to fight from those  —   for those miners whose jobs have been (inaudible). You know, when I was in West Virginia, I met incredible people and a lot of miners. And I said to them, did you ever think of maybe moving to another area and going into another profession? AUDIENCE: Hell no! TRUMP: They said, Mr. Trump  —   just like she goes, hell no. (LAUGHTER) But just like  —   it’s just like that. They say, Mr. Trump, we love being miners, we love mining. Our grandparents did it, our great parents  —   grandparents did it, our fathers. We love mining. And I realized the love that they had for mining. And as you remember, weeks before Hillary Clinton made a statement someplace else before going to West Virginia and trying to get their vote, if you can believe this, she said we are going to close the mines and we’re going to put the miners out of work. Then she went to West Virginia and she tried to convince them, well, she didn’t mean it. Let me tell you, folks, we’re going to take care of our mines, we’re going to take care of our miners. We’re going to have clean coal, clean coal, we’re going to have them. But we’re going to bring back our (inaudible). (APPLAUSE) And we’re going to protect a great new resource, something that really over the last fairly short period of time, from an energy standpoint, has become so important, and something so important to this area; natural gas. So we are going to keep our people working and we’re going to have a lot more people working. We are going to get rid of Obamacare. We are going to get rid of Common Core. We’re going to bring our education local. (APPLAUSE) We are going to make great and lasting trade deals, not the horrible trade deals. This year on trade, we will have almost an $800 billion trade deficit. Think of it. Who negotiates these deals? Who’s negotiating? In other words, countrywide. With China, we’re going to lose almost $500 billion. But think of this, countrywide we do all this work. We’re going to have a trade deficit of $800 almost billion. It’s not going to happen anymore, folks. It’s not going to happen anymore. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to trade  —   we’re going to trade, but I say we’re going to now have a  . You now, we have a one  —   we have a   superhighway going into Mexico, right? You know that. Hello. AUDIENCE: Hi! TRUMP: We have a   highway going into Mexico. We’re going to make it maybe for a little while, to get some of it back, a   highway coming back. But ultimately, it’s going to be like this. We want to be fair. We’re going to bring Pennsylvania steel and manufacturing back. We’re going to unleash trillions in new energy, and we’re going to put our miners back to work. We’re going to protect our hunters and save our Second Amendment. (APPLAUSE) Hillary Clinton wants to do big, big damage, big, big damage to the Second Amendment. We’re going to fix your schools and your inner cities and reduce crime and poverty and joblessness. And we’re going to liberate millions of African Americans and Hispanic Americans from poverty. What they’re going through is unbelievable. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to make Pennsylvania and Ohio, and so many other places within our country, the manufacturing hub of the world once again. We’re going to be able to do it. It’s going to be not even hard to do. But to do these things, we must push aside the politicians and the special interests who have betrayed us. They’ve betrayed us. So this year, we have an election coming up on November 8th. So important that you get out and vote. So important that you watch other communities, because we don’t want this election stolen from us. We don’t want this election stolen from us. We do not want this election stolen. We have a movement like they’ve never seen before. Bill O’Reilly and others have said this is the single greatest phenomena they’ve ever seen. We have a movement like no other. We’re going to make that movement incredible. And what we’re going to end up with is this: a country that’s not divided, a country that loves itself and loves its people. (APPLAUSE) We’re going to make a country where people are proud to come in, people are proud to come through the borders, people want to come through because they respect us and they respect our values. We are going to make a country that’s wealthy again. We’re going to make a country that’s safe again. We’re going to make a country that know what it’s doing and  —   and functions on common sense again  —   functions on common sense. (APPLAUSE) Our future is in our hands. On November 8th, you’re going to look back and you’re going to say I believe, years from now, that was the most important day and the most important vote that you have ever cast because we’re going to turn our country around, we’re going to take back our country, we’re going to take back the White House. (APPLAUSE) We are going to work so hard and we are going to make America great again. (APPLAUSE) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

"      Their public conference had been interrupted by a demonstration march and a bomb threat, so the white nationalists decided to meet secretly instead. They slipped past police officers and protesters into a hotel in downtown Memphis. The country had elected its first black president just a few days earlier, and now in November 2008, dozens of the world’s most prominent racists wanted to strategize for the years ahead. “The fight to restore White America begins now,” their agenda read. The room was filled in part by former heads of the Ku Klux Klan and prominent   but one of the keynote speeches had been reserved for a Florida community college student who had just turned 19. Derek Black was already hosting his own radio show. He had launched a white nationalist website for children and won a local political election in Florida. “The leading light of our movement,” was how the conference organizer introduced him, and then Derek stepped to the lectern. “The way ahead is through politics,” he said. “We can infiltrate. We can take the country back. ” Years before Donald Trump launched a presidential campaign based in part on the politics of race and division, a group of avowed white nationalists was working to make his rise possible by pushing its ideology from the radical fringes ever closer to the far conservative right. Many attendees in Memphis had transformed over their careers from Klansmen to white supremacists to   “racial realists,” and Derek Black represented another step in that evolution.  He never used racial slurs. He didn’t advocate violence or lawbreaking. He had won a Republican committee seat in Palm Beach County, Fla. where Trump also had a home, without ever mentioning white nationalism, talking instead about the ravages of political correctness, affirmative action and unchecked Hispanic immigration. He was not only a leader of racial politics but also a product of them. His father, Don Black, had created Stormfront, the Internet’s first and largest white nationalist site, with 300, 000 users and counting. His mother, Chloe, had once been married to David Duke, one of the country’s most infamous racial zealots, and Duke had become Derek’s godfather. They had raised Derek at the forefront of the movement, and some white nationalists had begun calling him “the heir. ” Now Derek spoke in Memphis about the future of their ideology. “The Republican Party has to be either demolished or taken over,” he said. “I’m kind of banking on the Republicans staking their claim as the white party. ” A few people in the audience started to clap, and then a few more began to whistle, and before long the whole group was applauding. “Our moment,” Derek said, because at least in this room there was consensus. They believed white nationalism was about to drive a political revolution. They believed, at least for the moment, that Derek would help lead it. “Years from now, we will look back on this,” he said. “The great intellectual move to save white people started today. ”  ***    Don Black poses for a portrait earlier this month in Crossville, Tenn. Black established the white nationalist website Stormfront, which has grown to more than 300, 000 users. (Matt   Washington Post)  Eight years later, that future they envisioned in Memphis was finally being realized in the presidential election of 2016. Donald Trump was retweeting white supremacists. Hillary Clinton was making speeches about the rise of white hate and quoting David Duke, who had launched his own campaign for the U. S. Senate. White nationalism had bullied its way toward the very center of American politics, and yet, one of the people who knew the ideology best was no longer anywhere near that center. Derek had just turned 27, and instead of leading the movement, he was trying to untangle himself not only from the national moment but also from a life he no longer understood. From the very beginning, that life had taken place within the insular world of white nationalism, where there was never any doubt about what whiteness could mean in the United States. Derek had been taught that America was intended as a place for white Europeans and that everyone else would eventually have to leave. He was told to be suspicious of other races, of the U. S. government, of tap water and of pop culture. His parents pulled him out of public school in West Palm Beach at the end of third grade, when they heard his black teacher say the word “ain’t. ” By then, Derek was one of only a few white students in a class of mostly Hispanics and Haitians, and his parents decided he would be better off at home. “It is a shame how many White minds are wasted in that system,” Derek wrote shortly thereafter, on the Stormfront children’s website he built at age 10. “I am no longer attacked by gangs of non whites. I am learning pride in myself, my family and my people. ”    Derek Black, at age 9, at a gathering in Jackson, Miss. of the white nationalist Council of Conservative Citizens. He is pictured with   Gov. Kirk Fordice. (Courtesy of Derek Black)  Because he was   white nationalism could become a focus of his education. It also meant he had the freedom to begin traveling with his father, who left for several weeks each year to speak at white nationalist conferences in the Deep South. Don Black had grown up in Alabama, where in the 1970s, he joined a group called the White Youth Alliance, led by David Duke, who at the time was married to Chloe. That relationship eventually dissolved, and years later, Don and Chloe reconnected, married and had Derek in 1989. They moved into Chloe’s childhood home in West Palm Beach to raise Derek along with Chloe’s two young daughters. There were Guatemalan immigrants living down the block and Jewish retirees moving into a condo nearby. “Usurpers,” Don sometimes called them, but Chloe didn’t want to move away from her aging mother in Florida, so Don settled for taking long road trips to the whitest parts of the South. Don and Derek always stayed on those trips with Don’s friends from the white power movement, and soon Derek had heard many of their stories. There was the time his father, then 16, was shot in the chest while working on a segregationist campaign in Georgia. There was the day in 1981 when he and eight other extremists made plans to board a boat stocked with dynamite, automatic weapons and a Nazi flag. Their plan, called Operation Red Dog, was to take over the tiny Caribbean island nation of Dominica, but instead Don had been caught, arrested and sentenced to three years in prison. He learned some computer programming in federal prison and eventually launched Stormfront in 1995 under the motto: “White Pride World Wide. ” Over the years, his website attracted all kinds of extremists: skinheads, militia groups, terrorists and Holocaust deniers. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a   group, a handful of the people who posted on Stormfront had gone on to commit hate crimes, including killings. One message board user shot and wounded three children at a Jewish   center in Los Angeles in 1999. Another killed his Jewish neighbor in 2000 in a town near Pittsburgh. “We attract too many sociopaths,” Don posted, and he decided that more moderation would give Stormfront greater mainstream credibility. By then Stormfront had become his   job, even though he wasn’t making much money and the family was getting by on Chloe’s salary as an executive assistant. Each morning, she would go to work, and Don would go to his crowded desk in their   house, where he recruited authors and academics from the alternative right to post on his site.  In 2008, he banned slurs, Nazi symbols and threats of violence, even as other parts of his own language remained unchanged. He didn’t have friends so much as “comrades. ” Everyone was either “with us” or “against us,” “sympathetic” or an “enemy,” so Derek strengthened his relationship with his father by becoming his greatest ideological ally. Derek learned Web coding and designed the Stormfront site for children. He was interviewed about hate speech on Nickelodeon, daytime talk shows, HBO and in USA Today. “The devil child,” was how Don sometimes referred to him, with pride and affection. But Don also read through nasty emails his son received from strangers who were offended by the Stormfront children’s page, and he began to worry about a    who was becoming so familiar with the   transaction of prejudice and hate. “You will rot in hell,” read one email, in 2002. “I WISH you were in the same room as me right now,” read another. “You would have to eat through a straw, you low life scumbag. ” Don told Derek to stop checking his messages. He would later remember wondering: “Did I foist this onto him? Is he just doing this for me?” He asked Derek whether he wanted to shut down the children’s page, but Derek said the emails didn’t bother him. That was the enemy. Who cared what they thought?  ***    Ku Klux Klan grand wizard Don Black, center, at the   climax of a Klan recruitment rally in 1982. Black would later leave the Klan and begin describing himself as a “white civil rights advocate” or a “racial realist. ” (Bettmann Archive)  After that, Don began to see something different when he looked at his son: not just a child born into the movement but also an emerging leader, with drive and conviction that seemed entirely his own. Don had spent more than four decades waiting for whites to have a racial awakening in America, and now he began to think that the teenager living in his house could be a potential catalyst. “All of my strengths without any of my weaknesses,” Don would later say about Derek back then. “He was smarter than me. He had more insight. He never held himself back. ” So many others in white nationalism had come to their conclusions out of anger and fear, but Derek tended to like most people he met, regardless of race. Instead, he sought out logic and science to confirm his worldview, reading studies from conservative think tanks about biological differences between races, IQ disparities and rates of violent crime committed by blacks against whites. He launched a daily radio show to share his views, and Don paid $275 each week to have it broadcast on the AM station in nearby Lake Worth. On the air, Derek helped popularize the idea of a white genocide, that whites were losing their culture and traditions to massive, nonwhite immigration. “If we say it a thousand times  —   ‘White genocide! We are losing control of our country!’  —   politicians are going to start saying it, too,” he said. He repeated the idea in interviews, Stormfront posts and during his speech at the conference in Memphis, when he was at his most certain. Derek finished high school, enrolled in community college and ran for a seat on the Republican committee, beating an incumbent with 60 percent of the vote. He decided he wanted to study medieval European history, so he applied to New College of Florida, a   liberal arts school with a strong history program. “We want you to make history, not just study it,” Don and Chloe sometimes reminded him. New College ranked as one of the most liberal schools in the state  —   “most   most ” Don explained on the radio  —   and to some white nationalists, it seemed a bizarre choice. Once, on the air, a friend asked Don whether he worried about sending his son to a “hotbed of multiculturalism,” and Don started to laugh. “If anyone is going to be influenced here, it will be them,” he said. “Soon enough, the whole faculty and student body are going to know who they have in their midst. ”  *** At first they knew nothing about him, and Derek tried to keep it that way. New College was in Sarasota, three hours across the state, and it was the first time Derek had lived away from home. He attended an introductory college meeting about diversity and concluded that the quickest way to be ostracized was to proclaim himself a racist. He decided not to mention white nationalism on campus, at least until he had made some friends. Most of the other students in his dorm were college freshmen, and as a    transfer student, Derek already had a car and a legal ID to buy beer. The qualities that had once made him seem quirky  —     red hair, the cowboy hat he wore, a passion for medieval    —   made him a good fit for New College, where many of the 800 students were a little bit weird. He forged his own armor and dressed as a knight for Halloween. He watched zombie movies with students from his dorm, a group that included a Peruvian immigrant and an Orthodox Jew. Maybe they were usurpers, as his father had said, but Derek also kind of liked them, and gradually he went from keeping his convictions quiet to actively disguising them. When another student mentioned that he had been reading about the racist implications of “Lord of the Rings” on a website called Stormfront, Derek pretended he had never heard of it. Meanwhile, early each weekday morning, he would go outside and call in to his radio show. He told friends these were regular calls home to his parents, and in a way, that was true. Every morning, it was Derek and his father, cued in by music from Merle Haggard’s “I’m a White Boy. ” Derek often repeated his belief that whites were being wiped out  —   “a genocide in our own country,” he said. He told listeners the problem was “massive, nonwhite immigration. ” He said Obama was an “  radical. ” He said white voters were “just waiting for a politician who actually talks about all the ways whites are being stepped on. ” He said it was the “critical fight of our lifetime. ” Then he hung up and went back to the dorm to play Taylor Swift songs on his guitar or to take one of the college’s sailboats onto Sarasota Bay. He left after one semester to study abroad in Germany, because he wanted to learn the language. He kept in touch with New College partly through a student message board, known as the forum, whose updates were automatically sent to his email. One night in April 2011, Derek noticed a message posted to all students at 1:56 a. m. It was written by someone Derek didn’t know  —   an upperclassman who had been researching terrorist groups online when he stumbled across a familiar face. “Have you seen this man?” the message read, and beneath those words was a picture that was unmistakable. The red hair. The cowboy hat. “Derek black: white supremacist, radio host  …    new college student? ??” the post read. “How do we as a community respond?”  ***    Derek Black speaks shortly after his election to the Republican Party’s executive committee in Palm Beach County, Fla. (Richard   Palm Beach Post)  By the time Derek returned to campus for the next semester, more than a thousand responses had been written to that post. It was the biggest message thread in the history of a school that Derek now wanted badly to avoid. He returned to Sarasota, applied for permission to live outside of required student housing and rented a room a few miles away. A few of his friends from the previous year emailed to say they felt betrayed, and strangers sometimes flipped him off from a safe distance on campus. But, for the most part, Derek avoided public spaces, and other students mostly stared or left him alone, even as their speculation about him continued on the forum. “Maybe he’s trying to get away from a life he didn’t choose. ” “He chooses to be a racist public figure. We choose to call him a racist in public. ” “I just want this guy to die a painful death along with his entire family. Is that too much to ask?” “I’d like to see Derek Black respond to all of this.   …    ” Instead of replying, Derek read the forum and used it as motivation to plan a conference for white nationalists in East Tennessee. “Victory through Argumentation: Verbal tactics for anyone white and normal,” he wrote in the invitation. He had spoken at several conferences, including the one in Memphis, but only now did he feel compelled to create another event as white nationalism continued to spread. The white genocide idea he had been championing had finally become a fixture of conservative radio. David Duke had started trying to build a relationship with “our friends and allies in the tea party. ” Donald Trump had riveted the   with his investigation into Obama’s birth certificate, and one Gallup poll suggested that only 38 percent of Americans “definitely” believed Obama was born in the United States. “A critical juncture to keep increasing the profile of our movement,” Derek said on the radio, so he registered 150 attendees and scheduled speeches by his father, Duke and other separatist icons. Another New College student learned about the conference and posted details on the forum, where gradually a new way of thinking had begun to emerge. “Ostracizing Derek won’t accomplish anything,” one student wrote. “We have a chance to be real activists and actually affect one of the leaders of white supremacy in America. This is not an exaggeration. It would be a victory for civil rights. ” “Who’s clever enough to think of something we can do to change this guy’s mind?” One of Derek’s acquaintances from that first semester decided he might have an idea. He started reading Stormfront and listening to Derek’s radio show. Then, in late September, he sent Derek a text message. “What are you doing Friday night?” he wrote.  *** Matthew Stevenson had started hosting weekly Shabbat dinners at his campus apartment shortly after enrolling in New College in 2010. He was the only Orthodox Jew at a school with little Jewish infrastructure, so he began cooking for a small group of students at his apartment each Friday night. Matthew always drank from a kiddush cup and said the traditional prayers, but most of his guests were Christian, atheist, black or Hispanic  —   anyone   enough to listen to a few blessings in Hebrew. Now, in the fall of 2011, Matthew invited Derek to join them. Matthew had spent a few weeks debating whether it was a good idea. He and Derek had lived near each other in the dorm, but they hadn’t spoken since Derek was exposed on the forum. Matthew, who almost always wore a yarmulke, had experienced enough   in his life to be familiar with the KKK, David Duke and Stormfront. He went back and read some of Derek’s posts on the site from 2007 and 2008: “Jews are NOT white. ” “Jews worm their way into power over our society. ” “They must go. ” Matthew decided his best chance to affect Derek’s thinking was not to ignore him or confront him, but simply to include him. “Maybe he’d never spent time with a Jewish person before,” Matthew remembered thinking. It was the only social invitation Derek had received since returning to campus, so he agreed to go. The Shabbat meals had sometimes included eight or 10 students, but this time only a few showed up. “Let’s try to treat him like anyone else,” Matthew remembered instructing them. Derek arrived with a bottle of wine. Nobody mentioned white nationalism or the forum, out of respect for Matthew. Derek was quiet and polite, and he came back the next week and then the next, until after a few months, nobody felt all that threatened, and the Shabbat group grew back to its original size.    Matthew Stevenson, left, and Derek Black met at New College, in Sarasota, Fla. Stevenson eventually invited Black to join a diverse group for Shabbat dinners. (Matthew Stevenson photo)  On the rare occasions when Derek directed conversation during those dinners, it was about the particulars of Arabic grammar, or marine aquatics, or the roots of Christianity in medieval times. He came across as smart and curious, and mostly he listened. He heard a Peruvian immigrant tell stories about attending a high school that was 90 percent Hispanic. He asked Matthew about his opinions on Israel and Palestine. They were both still wary of each other: Derek wondered whether Matthew was trying to get him drunk so he would say offensive things that would appear on the forum; Matthew wondered whether Derek was trying to cultivate a Jewish friend to protect himself against charges of  . But they also liked each other, and they started playing pool at a bar near campus. Some members of the Shabbat group gradually began to ask Derek about his views, and he occasionally clarified them in conversations and emails throughout 2011 and 2012. He said he was   on abortion. He said he was against the death penalty. He said he didn’t believe in violence or the KKK or Nazism or even white supremacy, which he insisted was different from white nationalism. He wrote in an email that his only concern was that “massive immigration and forced integration” was going to result in a white genocide. He said he believed in the rights of all races but thought each was better off in its own homeland, living separately. “You have never clarified, Derek,” one of his Shabbat friends wrote to him. “You’ve never said, ‘Hey all, this is what I do believe and this is what I don’t.’ It’s not the job of someone who’s potentially   by someone else to approach that person to see if they are in fact  . ” “I guess I only value the opinions of people I know,” Derek wrote back, and now he was beginning to count his Shabbat friends among those he knew and respected. “You’re naturally right that I deemphasize my own role,” he wrote to them. He decided early in his final year at New College to finally respond on the forum. He wanted his friends on campus to feel comfortable, even if he still believed some of their homelands were elsewhere. He sat at a coffee shop and began writing his post, softening his ideology with each successive draft. He no longer thought the endpoint of white nationalism was forced deportation for nonwhites, but gradual   in which nonwhites would leave on their own. He didn’t believe in   right now, at least not for his friends, but just eventually, in concept. “It’s been brought to my attention that people might be scared or intimidated or even feel unsafe here because of things said about me,” he began. “I wanted to try to address these concerns publicly, as they absolutely should not exist. I do not support oppression of anyone because of his or her race, creed, religion, gender, socioeconomic status or anything similar. ” The forum post, intended only for the college, was leaked to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) which kept a public “Intelligence File” on Derek and other racist leaders, and the group emailed Derek for clarification. Was he disavowing white nationalism? “Your views are now quite different from what many people thought,” the email read. Derek received the message while vacationing in Europe during winter break. He was staying with Duke, who had started broadcasting his radio show from a part of Europe with lenient   laws. “The tea party is taking some of these ideas mainstream,” Duke said on a broadcast one morning. “Whites are finally coming around to my point of view,” he said another day, and even if Derek now thought some of what Duke said sounded exaggerated or even alarming, the man was still his godfather. Derek wrote back to the SPLC from Duke’s couch. “Everything I said (on the forum) is true,” he wrote. “I also believe in White Nationalism. My post and my racial ideology are not mutually exclusive concepts. ” ***    Former Ku Klux Klan leader and current U. S. Senate candidate David Duke campaigns in Louisiana. Duke acted as a godfather and a mentor to Derek Black during his rise in white nationalism. (Gerald  )  But the unstated truth was that Derek was becoming more and more confused about exactly what he believed. Sometimes he looked through posts on Stormfront, hoping to reaffirm his ideology, but now the message threads about Obama’s birth certificate or DNA tests for citizenship just seemed bizarre and conspiratorial. He stopped posting on Stormfront. He began inventing excuses to get out of his radio show, leaving his father alone on the air each morning to explain why Derek wouldn’t be calling in. He was preparing for a test. He was giving those liberal professors hell. Except sometimes what Derek was really doing was taking his kayak to the beach, so he could be alone to think. He had always based his opinions on fact, and lately his logic was being dismantled by emails from his Shabbat friends. They sent him links to studies showing that racial disparities in IQ could largely be explained by extenuating factors like prenatal nutrition and educational opportunities. They gave him scientific papers about the effects of discrimination on blood pressure, job performance and mental health. He read articles about white privilege and the unfair representation of minorities on television news. One friend emailed: “The geNOcide against whites is incredibly, horribly insulting and degrading to real, actual, lived and experienced genocides against Jews, against Rwandans, against Armenians, etc. ” “I don’t hate anyone because of race or religion,” Derek clarified on the forum. “I am not a white supremacist,” he wrote. “I don’t believe people of any race, religion or otherwise should have to leave their homes or be segregated or lose any freedom. ” “Derek,” a friend responded. “I feel like you are a representative of a movement you barely buy into. You need to identify with more than   of a belief system to consider it your belief system. ” He was taking classes in Jewish scripture and German multiculturalism during his last year at New College, but most of his research was focused on medieval Europe. He learned that Western Europe had begun not as a great society of genetically superior people but as a technologically backward place that lagged behind Islamic culture. He studied the 8th century to the 12th century, trying to trace back the modern concepts of race and whiteness, but he couldn’t find them anywhere. “We basically just invented it,” he concluded. “Get out of this,” one of his Shabbat friends emailed a few weeks after Derek’s graduation in May 2013, urging Derek to publicly disavow white nationalism. “Get out before it ruins some part of your future more than it already irreparably has. ” Derek stayed near campus to housesit for a professor after graduation, and he began to consider making a public statement. He knew he no longer believed in white nationalism, and he had made plans to distance himself from his past by changing part of his name and moving across the country for graduate school. His instinct was to slip away quietly, but his advocacy had always been public  —   a legacy of radio shows, Internet posts, TV appearances, and an annual conference on racial tactics. He was still considering what to do when he returned home to visit his parents later that summer. His father was tracking the rise of white nationalism on cable TV, and his parents were talking about “enemies” and “comrades” in the “ongoing war,” but now it sounded ridiculous to Derek. He spent the day rebuilding windows with them, which was one of Derek’s quirky hobbies that his parents had always supported. They had bought his guitar and joined in his medieval  . They had paid his tuition at the liberal arts college where he had Shabbat dinners. They had taught him, most of all, to be independent and ideological, and to speak his beliefs even when doing so resulted in backlash. He left the house that night and went to a bar. He took out his computer and began writing a statement. “A large section of the community I grew up in believes strongly in white nationalism, and members of my family whom I respect greatly, particularly my father, have long been resolute advocates for that cause. I was not prepared to risk driving a wedge in those relationships. “After a great deal of thought since then, I have resolved that it is in the best interests of everyone involved to be honest about my slow but steady disaffiliation from white nationalism. I can’t support a movement that tells me I can’t be a friend to whomever I wish or that other people’s races require me to think of them in a certain way or be suspicious at their advancements. “The things I have said as well as my actions have been harmful to people of color, people of Jewish descent, activists striving for opportunity and fairness for all. I am sorry for the damage done. ” He continued to write for several more paragraphs before addressing an email to the SPLC, the group his father had considered a primary adversary for 40 years. “Publish in full,” Derek instructed. Then he attached the letter and hit “send. ”  ***    Don Black poses for a portrait at a park Oct. 2, 2016, in Crossville, Tenn. (Matt   Washington Post)  Don was at the computer the next afternoon searching Google when Derek’s name popped up in a headline on his screen. For a decade, Don had been typing “Stormfront” and “Derek Black” into the search bar a few times each week to track his son’s public rise in white nationalism. This particular story had been published by the SPLC, which Don had always referred to as the “Poverty Palace. ” “Activist Son of Key Racist Leader Renounces White Nationalism,” it read, and Don began to read the letter. It had phrases like “structural oppression,” “privilege,” “limited opportunity,” and “marginalized groups”  —   the kind of   language Don and Derek had often made fun of on the radio. “You got hacked,” Don remembered telling Derek, once he reached him on the phone. “It’s real,” Derek said, and then he heard the sound of his father hanging up. For the next few hours, Don was in disbelief. Maybe Derek was pulling a prank on him. Maybe he still believed in white nationalism but just wanted an easier life. Derek called back, and this time his mother answered. She said that she didn’t want to speak to him. She handed the phone to Don, and his voice was shaky and tearful. Derek had never heard him that way. “I can’t talk,” Don said, and he hung up again. Later that night, Don logged on to the Stormfront message board. “I’m sure this will be all over the Net and our local media, so I’ll start here,” he wrote, posting a link to Derek’s letter. “I don’t want to talk to him. He says he doesn’t understand why we’d feel betrayed just because he announced his ‘personal beliefs’ to our worst enemies. ” For the next several days, Don couldn’t bring himself to post anything more. “I was a little depressed anyway, but at that point I wanted to quit everything,” he said later, remembering that time. “What’s the point? I didn’t do much of anything for probably 10 days. It was the worst event of my adult life. ” He logged back onto Stormfront a week later. “After a miserable seven days, I feel the need to vent,” he wrote. “I only know what Derek tells me, which has been baffling. I’ve decided he really believes this crap. Derek repeated his belief that family ties are separate from politics. I said that obviously wasn’t true with a family centered around political activism. ” Hundreds of posts quickly followed. Some offered Don condolences. Others said that Derek was a traitor or that Don could no longer be trusted, either. Don wrote a few posts in response, sometimes defending Derek and other times distancing himself, until after a few weeks it all hurt too much. “I’m closing this thread,” Don wrote, finally, describing it as an “open wound. ”  *** Derek returned home a few weeks later for his father’s birthday, even though his mother and his   had asked him not to come. “I think I might be getting disowned,” Derek had written to one college friend. But he was about to leave Florida for graduate school, and he wanted to say goodbye. He arrived at his grandmother’s house for the party, and he would later remember how strange it felt when his   would barely acknowledge him. His mother was polite but cold. Don tried to invite Derek inside, but the rest of the family wanted him to leave. “I got uninvited to my own party,” Don later remembered. “They said if I wanted to see him, we both had to go. ” They left and went for a drive, first to the beach and then to a restaurant, where they sat at a booth near the back. Derek still had his dry sense of humor. He still made smart observations about politics and history. “Same old Derek,” Don concluded, after a few hours, and that fact surprised him. His grief had been so profound that he’d expected some physical manifestation of the loss. Instead, he found himself forgetting for several minutes at a time that Derek was now “living on the other side. ” Don asked Derek about the theories that had emerged on the Stormfront message thread. Was he just faking a change to have an easier career? Was this his way of rebelling? When Derek denied those things, Don mentioned the theory he himself had come to believe  —   the one David Duke had posited in the first hours after Derek’s letter went public: Stockholm syndrome. Derek had become a hostage to liberal academia and then experienced empathy for his captors. “That’s so patronizing,” Derek remembered saying. “How can I prove this is what I really believe?” He tried to convince Don for a few hours at the restaurant. He told him about white privilege and repeated the scientific studies about institutionalized racism. He mentioned the great Islamic societies that had developed algebra and predicted a lunar eclipse. He said that now, as he recognized strains of white nationalism spreading into mainstream politics, he felt accountable. “It’s not just that I was wrong. It’s that it caused real damage,” he remembered saying. “I can’t believe I’m arguing with you, of all people, about racial realities,” Don remembered telling him. The restaurant was closing, and they were no closer to an understanding. Derek went to sleep at his grandmother’s house. Then he woke up early and started driving across the country alone.  ***    Derek Black is pictured Sept. 25, 2016. “It’s scary to know that I helped spread this stuff, and now it’s out there,” he told a friend, alluding to the ideology he once promoted. (Matt   Washington Post)  Every day since then, Derek had been working to put distance between himself and his past. He was still living across the country after finishing his master’s degree, and he was starting to learn Arabic to be able to study the history of early Islam. He hadn’t spoken to anyone in white nationalism since his defection, aside from occasional calls home to his parents. Instead, he’d spent his time catching up on aspects of pop culture he’d once been taught to discredit: liberal newspaper columns, rap music and Hollywood movies. He’d come to admire President Obama. He decided to trust the U. S. government. He started drinking tap water. He had taken budget trips to Barcelona, Paris, Dublin, Nicaragua and Morocco, immersing himself in as many cultures as he could. He joined a new online message group, this one for couch surfers, and he opened up his   apartment to strangers looking for a temporary place to stay. It felt increasingly good to trust people  —   to try to interact without prejudice or judgment  —   and after a while, Derek began to feel detached from the person he had been. But then came the election campaign of 2016, and suddenly the white nationalism Derek had been trying to unlearn was the unavoidable subtext to national debates over refugees, immigration, Black Lives Matter and the election itself. Late in August, Derek watched in his apartment as Hillary Clinton gave a major speech about the rise of racism. She explained how white supremacists had rebranded themselves as white nationalists. She referenced Duke and mentioned the concept of a “white genocide,” which Derek had once helped popularize. She talked about how Trump had hired a campaign manager with ties to the  . She said: “A fringe movement has essentially taken over the Republican Party. ” It was the very same point Derek had spent so much of his life believing in, but now it made him feel both fearful for the country and implicated. “It’s scary to know that I helped spread this stuff, and now it’s out there,” he told one of his Shabbat friends. He also wondered whether he would ever be able to completely detach himself from his past, when so much about it remained public. He was still occasionally recognized as a former racist in graduate school; still written into the will of a man he had befriended through white nationalism; still the godson of Duke; still the son of Chloe and Don. Late this summer, for the first time in years, he traveled to Florida to see them. At a time of increasingly contentious rhetoric, he wanted to hear what his father had to say. They sat in the house and talked about graduate school and Don’s new German shepherd. But after a while, their conversation turned back to ideology, the topic they had always preferred. Don, who usually didn’t vote, said he was going to support Trump. Derek said he had taken an online political quiz, and his views aligned 97 percent with Hillary Clinton’s. Don said immigration restrictions sounded like a good start. Derek said he actually believed in more immigration, because he had been studying the social and economic benefits of diversity. Don thought that would result in a white genocide. Derek thought race was a false concept anyway. They sat across from each other, searching for ways to bridge the divide. The bay was one block away. Just across from there was    where Trump had lived and vacationed for so many years, once installing an   pole for a gigantic American flag. “Who would have thought he’d be the one to take it mainstream?” Don said, and in a moment of so much division, it was the one point on which they agreed. "
"     On Sunday night,   Donald Trump gave his first extended TV interview since winning the White House last Tuesday.  He and his entire family sat down with ”60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl. To commemorate the occasion, I thought I would annotate the transcript using Genius. Using Genius, I annotated it. You can too! Sign up for Genius and annotate alongside me! To see an annotation, click or tap the highlighted part of the transcript.  Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump. Donald Trump: Thank you. Lesley Stahl: You’re  . Donald Trump: Thank you. Lesley Stahl: How surprised were you? Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I    I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven    Lesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose. Donald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31, 000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I    when I left, I said, “How are we gonna lose?” We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, “This doesn’t look like second place. ” So we were really happy, I mean, it    these are great people. Lesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you? Donald Trump: I think so, it’s enormous. I’ve done a lotta big things, I’ve never done anything like this. It is so big, it is    it’s so enormous, it’s so amazing. Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn’t talk? Donald Trump: A    a little bit, a little bit. And I    I realized that this is a whole different life for me now. Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call. Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn’t have been nicer. She just said, “Congratulations, Donald, well done. ” And I said, “I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor. ” She is very strong and very smart. Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him? Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day. Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say? Donald Trump: He actually called last night. Lesley Stahl: What did he say? Donald Trump: And    he couldn’t have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he’s ever seen. Lesley Stahl: He said that. Donald Trump: He was very, very    really, very nice. Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her? Donald Trump: Well, it was a   nasty. Donald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough    do I regret? I mean, I’m sitting here with you now and we’re gonna do a great job for the country. We’re going to make America great again, I mean, that’s       it began with that and that’s where we are right now. There are so    Lesley Stahl: So    no regrets    Donald Trump: I can’t regret.    I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say.    but I will say    it    it really is something that I’m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign. Lesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama? Donald Trump: Sure. Lesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15? Donald Trump: 15 max. Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it       in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told    the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right    Lesley Stahl: Like what? Donald Trump: Well  …     Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat. Donald Trump:  Well, look I don’t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that’s tough. It’s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view. Lesley Stahl:  .    Donald Trump: And I like having that because I’m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to    very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects. Donald Trump: —  and we were talking about some victories, also, some things    that he feels very good about.    Lesley Stahl:    Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on    the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation. Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it. Donald Trump: Well, he didn’t ask me, no, he told    you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that. Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you    Donald Trump: No, I think I’m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I’m not. I’m actually not. I’m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we    we had a very good chemistry going.    and I really found —  it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting. Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you’ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you’      Donald Trump: You know what, it was a    it was a very interesting thing    I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like? Lesley Stahl: Yeah. Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other —   Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness? Donald Trump: I’ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that’s strange. I’m actually surprised to tell you that. It’   you know, a little bit strange.  Lesley Stahl: Do you think    that your election is a repudiation of his presidency? Donald Trump: No, I think it’s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They’ve let ‘em down on the job front. They’ve even let ‘em down in terms of the war front. You know, we’ve been fighting this war for 15    Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign. Donald Trump: We’ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of    and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what’s been taking place over a longer period of time than that. Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16,    people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president? Donald Trump: You know, I’ll conduct    in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look    when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it’s going to be America first. It’s not going to be what we’re doing —  we, we’ve    we’re losing this country. We’re losing this country. That’s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big. Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in? Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don’t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be. Lesley Stahl: Can you be? Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that’s easier. Honestly to do that, it’s easier. Lesley Stahl: So let’s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you’re going to do what you said or you’re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley Stahl: They’re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence? Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I’m very good at this, it’s called construction. Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence? Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be  —   it could be some fencing. Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants? Donald Trump:  What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we’re getting them out of our country, they’re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we’re going to make a determination on the people that you’re talking about who are terrific people, they’re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at    But before we make that    Lesley, it’s very important, we want to secure our border. Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was    one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away? Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We’re going to substantially simplify and lower the    Lesley Stahl: And you’ve got both Houses? Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do    Lesley Stahl: You can do things  . Donald Trump: It’s been a long time since it’s happened. Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don’t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going    instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed. Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money. Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team —   Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests. Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that? Donald Trump: I don’t like it, no. Lesley Stahl: You don’t like it, but your own transition team, it’s filled with lobbyists. Donald Trump: That’s the only people you have down there. Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby. Donald Trump: Sure. Everybody’s a lobbyist down    Lesley Stahl: Well, wait Donald Trump: That’s what they are. They’re lobbyists or special interests —   Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team. Donald Trump: —  we are trying to clean up Washington.    Lesley Stahl: How can you    Donald Trump: Everything, everything down    there are no    there are all people that work    that’s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we’re going to clean it up. We’re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we’re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren’t happy about, but we’re putting on term limits. We’re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist. Lesley Stahl: But you’re, but you’re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them? Donald Trump: I’m saying that they know the system right now, but we’re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out. Lesley Stahl: Let’s talk about your cabinet. Donald Trump: OK. Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions? Donald Trump: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Tell us. Donald Trump: Well, I can’t tell you that, but I have    Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on —   Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major   has called me, I’ve spoken to many of them and I’ll call the rest of them, but and I said, “Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is. ” France and U. K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia —  and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country. Lesley Stahl: One of the things you’re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you’ll do that quickly? Donald Trump: Yes. Very important. Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you    are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade? Donald Trump: So look, here’s what’s going to    I’m going    I’m  . The judges will be  . They’ll be very —   Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this    Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They’ll be   they’ll    in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody’s talking about the Second Amendment and they’re trying to dice it up and change it, they’re going to be very   Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states    Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won’t be able to get an abortion? Donald Trump: No, it’ll go back to the states. Lesley Stahl: By state —  no some    Donald Trump: Yeah. Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they’ll perhaps have to go, they’ll have to go to another state. Lesley Stahl: And that’s OK? Donald Trump: Well, we’ll see what happens. It’s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go. Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you’re taking on? Donald Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: Not at all? Donald Trump: I respect it. But I’m not scared by it. Lesley Stahl: Now you’re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your    Donald Trump: That’s only because they don’t know me. I really believe that’s only    Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that’   Donald Trump: I just don’t think they know me. Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they’re demonstrating against? Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had    if you look at WikiLeaks, we    Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are —   Donald Trump: Well Lesley —   Lesley Stahl: are professional? Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional,    Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about  —   they’re in every city. Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don’t you say to yourself, I guess you don’t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They’re afraid. Donald Trump: I would tell them don’t be afraid, absolutely. Lesley Stahl: But that’s not what you’re saying, I said   Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I    I am saying it, I’ve been saying it. Lesley Stahl: OK. Donald Trump: Don’t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don’t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, “Oh, that’s a terrible thing. ” And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here. It has been five full days since the election and   demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton’s edge in the popular vote, have been significant. When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name  …     or against his supporters. Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters. Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear    I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear    Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it? Donald Trump: I don’t hear it —  I saw, I saw one or two instances  …     Lesley Stahl: On social media? Donald Trump: But I think it’s a very small amount. Again, I think it’     Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?  Donald Trump: I would say don’t do it, that’s terrible, ‘cause I’m gonna bring this country together. Lesley Stahl: They’re harassing Latinos,    Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, “Stop it. ” If    if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it. During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton’s email issue. So we asked him if he plans to carry that out.  Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.  Donald Trump: Yeah. Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals —  and you said it was unfair. Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are    Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you’re upset about just put out there when you’re president? Donald Trump: So it’s a modern form of communication, between    you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million    Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up? Donald Trump: It’s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I’ll give it up entirely and throw out, that’s a tremendous    I pick    I’m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100, 000 people. I’m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, ‘cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That’s very    Lesley Stahl: But you’re going to do that as president?    Donald Trump: I’m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It’s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It’   it’s where it’s at.    I do believe this, I really believe that,    the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that. Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail? Donald Trump: Well, I’ll tell you what I’m going to do, I’m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we’ve been talking about. Lesley Stahl:    you know,    Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away. Lesley Stahl: You called her “crooked Hillary,” said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, “Lock em’ up. ” Donald Trump: Yeah. She    Lesley Stahl: Do you —   Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad    Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might  …     Donald Trump: I don’t want to hurt them. I don’t want to hurt them. They’re, they’re good people. I don’t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.   Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You’re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A       Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it’   a lot of work needs to be done.    it’      stuff on your shoulders.    we will take care of    day by day. I will stay true to myself. I’m very strong and    tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart. Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she’s going to be? Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she’s very warm. And I think she’ll have a platform where she’ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that’s what she wants to do. Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you’ve already said you’re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media. Melania Trump: I think it’s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way. It’s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign. Lesley Stahl: What about your husband’s tweeting? Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he    it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following. Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, “Come on”? Melania Trump: I did. Donald Trump: She    Melania Trump:    Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But  …     Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you? Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’   Donald Trump: I’m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don’t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across. Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him? Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time. Lesley Stahl: All the time? Melania Trump: All the time. Lesley Stahl: And    Melania Trump:    Lesley Stahl:    listen? Does    Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He’s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it. Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval? Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he’s affected every bit as much. Maybe more. Lesley Stahl: Maybe more. Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, “I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job. ” And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed. Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10? Melania Trump: 10. Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know? Melania Trump: He knows. He    Lesley Stahl: He knows? Melania Trump:   ’s going on. And, he’s very proud of his dad. Lesley Stahl:    you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness,    Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl:    everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign? Melania Trump: No. I didn’t feel it. Lesley Stahl: Not at all? Melania Trump: No. Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting. Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice. Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That’s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right? Melania Trump: They’re here. Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you? Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that. Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair’s out of place. Are you both prepared for this? Melania Trump: We are used to it. Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, ‘cause I’ve had a lot. But I’ve never had anything like this. Lesley Stahl: You won’t be able to walk down the    Melania Trump: I didn’t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It’s another level, but it will continue. At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces. Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation? Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don’   I haven’t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think    Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much? Donald Trump: Well, there’s been a lotta leaking, there’s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I’d answer a question like that. Lesley Stahl: Sounds like you’re not sure. Donald Trump: Well, sure, I’m not sure. I’d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns? Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I’m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn’t care because I won the election very easily. So they don’t care. I never thought they did care. Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy. Donald Trump: I do. Lesley Stahl: So do you still think it’s rigged? Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral    look, I won with the Electoral College. Lesley Stahl: Exactly. But do you    Donald Trump: You know, it’   Lesley Stahl:   ’s rigged? Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I    Lesley Stahl: Even though you won you’re saying    Donald Trump: I    well, you know, I’m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There’s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there’s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system. Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? You’re not going to take any vacations? You’ve said that. Donald Trump: We have so much work. There’s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We’re lowering taxes, we’re taking care of health care. I mean, there’s just so much to be done. So I don’t think we’ll be very big on vacations, no. Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president’s salary? Donald Trump: Well, I’ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I’ll take $1 a year. But it’s a    I don’t even know what it is. Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is? Lesley Stahl: $400, 000 you’re giving up. Donald Trump: No, I’m not gonna take the salary. I’m not taking it."
"          CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia.  Part I | Part II     Hundreds of criminals sentenced by D. C. judges under an obscure local law crafted to give second chances to young adult offenders have gone on to rob, rape or kill residents of the nation’s capital. The original intent of the law was to rehabilitate inexperienced criminals under the age of 22. The District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act allows for shorter sentences for some crimes and an opportunity for offenders to emerge with no criminal record. But a Washington Post investigation has found a pattern of violent offenders returning rapidly to the streets and committing more crimes. Hundreds have been sentenced under the act multiple times. In dozens of cases, D. C. judges were able to hand down Youth Act sentences shorter than those called for under mandatory minimum laws designed to deter armed robberies and other violent crimes. The criminals have often repaid that leniency by escalating their crimes of violence upon release. In 2013, four masked men entered the home of a family in Northeast Washington, held them at gunpoint and ransacked the house. One of the invaders, Shareem Hall, was sentenced under the Youth Act. He was released on probation in 2015. Almost exactly a year later, Hall and a   shot a    transgender woman, Deeniquia Dodds, during a robbery in the District, according to charging documents. It is unclear who pulled the trigger. Police said the pair were targeting transgender females. Dodds died nine days later. “You’re telling me you can come back out on the streets and rob again, hold people hostage again, kill again  —   because of the Youth Act?” said Joeann Lewis, Dodds’s aunt.    Joeann Lewis, with the ashes of her niece, Deeniquia Dodds, a transgender woman killed in Northeast Washington in July, allegedly by Shareem Hall and a  . (Linda   Washington Post)  Hall is one of at least 121 defendants sentenced under the Youth Act who have gone on to be charged with murder in the District since 2010, according to The Post’s analysis of available sentencing data and court records. Four of the slayings, including the killing of Dodds, occurred while the defendants could still have been incarcerated for previous crimes under mandatory minimum sentencing, and 30 of the killings took place while the suspects were on probation. Youth Act offenders accounted for 1 in 5 suspects arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010, a period that has seen a recent surge in homicides and growing public concern about repeat violent offenders. The cycle of violence has been largely shrouded from public view or oversight. D. C. judges do not track the use of the law, which provides a benefit to violent felons that experts say does not exist anywhere else in the country.      The District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act offers lenient sentences to offenders under 22 years old. But the Post found that at least 120 people sentenced under the Act since 2010 have gone on to be charged with murder. (Whitney   Washington Post)   After a young adult is convicted of a crime, the Youth Act allows judges to decide whether the offender can benefit from rehabilitation and should receive special treatment. The law gives felons a chance to have their convictions expunged from the public record if they serve out their sentences or complete their probation. Because of the way the law was written, Youth Act offenders also can avoid mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. The Post also found that judges applying the Youth Act generally give lighter sentences across the board. The law was enacted in 1985 during the mayoral administration of Marion Barry (D) at a time when jails were being filled with young men charged with drug crimes, in an attempt to protect African American youths from the stigma of lengthy prison sentences.  “We have a value in this city that youthful offenders should be rehabilitated,” said D. C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser. “But I don’t think anybody expects leniency for violent criminals. ” The judges declined The Post’s requests for interviews and also declined to comment about specific cases. In a written statement, the judges said they weigh many factors in sentencing, including the ages of offenders and the effect of their crimes on the victims.    “In considering whether to sentence a young person under the Youth Act, generally judges are aware that a felony conviction can create lifelong obstacles to becoming a good and productive citizen,” wrote Lynn Leibovitz and Milton Lee, who are, respectively, the presiding judge and deputy presiding judge of the criminal division of the D. C. Superior Court. “It is important to note that a sentence under the Youth Act gives the defendant this opportunity, not a guarantee, to get the benefit of a set aside of the conviction  —   it is still up to the defendant to perform during his or her sentence and to apply to the court or the Parole Commission to receive the benefit of the Youth Act. If the offender does not perform well, the conviction remains on his or her record. ” The D. C. Public Defender Service defended the use of the law. “The Youth Act is a valuable sentencing option because as the Supreme Court has recognized and science has shown, youthful offenders, compared to older adults, can have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform,” said PDS general counsel Laura Hankins in a written statement. She said her office knows of “hundreds” of young offenders who have successfully completed their sentences. From January 2010 to April 2016, 3, 188 sentences for felony crimes were handed down under the Youth Act, 73 percent of them in cases involving violent crimes or weapons offenses, The Post found.    To assess the effects of the Youth Act, The Post obtained data from the D. C. Sentencing Commission showing the date and outcome of every felony case since 2010. The data did not include names of offenders or judges, or details of the crimes. To link individuals to crimes, The Post wrote software to extract those details for every criminal case, including those that mentioned the Youth Act, in publicly available electronic court dockets. This search captured Youth Act cases in which people had not received the benefit of expungement either because they were still serving their sentences or had violated the terms of probation or release from prison. The overall success rate of the program is unclear because the identities of offenders disappear from public view if they complete the terms of their sentences. Among The Post’s findings: • At least 136 Youth Act sentences were given to young offenders convicted of armed robbery since 2010. • At least 750 offenders have been sentenced multiple times under the Youth Act in the past decade. More than 200 of those were sentenced for multiple violent or weapons offenses. • Judges have given roughly 2, 300 Youth Act sentences to young offenders for weapons offenses or crimes of violence since 2010. On average, the offenders have received about 60 percent of the prison time of   Act offenders who had comparable criminal histories and had committed similar crimes.    When asked about The Post’s findings, Leibovitz and Lee responded that the court “does not comment on data based on percentages, since sentencing is an individualized event based on many considerations. ” In a survey of states across the country, The Post was unable to find any law similar to the District’s Youth Act. An expert in national expungement laws told The Post that leniency programs typically focus on   or juvenile offenders and apply expungement to misdemeanors or other nonviolent crimes. “I’ve never heard of something like this,” said Anne Teigen, a program principal at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Colorado. “It is opposite of the trend nationally. ” In the District, Youth Act sentences have been handed down in cases involving victims who are vulnerable in ways that ordinarily lead to tougher sentences: an elderly woman held up at gunpoint; a brother and sister  —   12 and 13 years old  —   kidnapped outside their middle school and held hostage by someone armed with a box cutter; a pizza deliveryman hit on the head with a brick during a robbery; the driver of an ice cream truck whose vehicle was taken during an armed carjacking. In the summer of 2015, a D. C. jury found    twins Christopher and Christina Lucas guilty of committing a hate crime against a gay man in Columbia Heights in 2013. The twins stomped on the man, one called him a “       ” and his face was slashed with a sharp object. Prosecutors said the case very easily “could have been a homicide. ” They asked for 15 years.    D. C. Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams (Marvin   Washington Post)  D. C. Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams departed from voluntary sentencing guidelines, which recommended four to 15 years, and gave the twins a year in jail under the Youth Act. At a hearing two weeks later, amid community outrage, Williams justified her decision by invoking the Eminem song, “Lose Yourself,” saying that the Youth Act was designed to give “one shot” for the twins to reform. “It’s the most inspirational song, even though he’s applying it to, like, rap music,” the judge said in court. “It’s like, you only get one shot. And his one shot is that he had to  —   you know, it’s in the movie ‘8 Mile’ . . . the rap has to be so good. You only get one shot. ” The twins were rearrested this fall, Christopher for allegedly making a verbal threat and Christina for allegedly attempting to block officers from arresting her brother. Judge Williams declined to comment for this story. D. C. politicians wrote the Youth Act, but the judges, prosecutors and public defenders in the District who carry out the law are funded by Congress, because of the unique split in federal and local authority in the District. The judges are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for   terms and are not accountable to D. C. voters. Briefed on The Post’s findings, Mayor Bowser (D) said she thinks judges, prosecutors and public defenders have come to “misapply” the law at the expense of public safety. “Prosecutions, plea deals, sentences rendered, sentences served, and then what happens when folks are being supervised . . . the community should know that,” she said. “We can’t have a safe city if there are no quick and certain punishments for crimes. ” ‘I saw their scared faces’ Last year, homicides in the District jumped 54 percent from the previous year to 162, the highest total since 2008. A survey found that for the first time in almost a decade, crime had become the top concern of D. C. residents. Killings in 2015 charged to prior Youth Act recipients reached 22, double the previous year’s total.  Tavon Pinkney was charged with one of those 22 homicides. In 2014, the    was arrested on a robbery charge after he snatched a man’s Apple iPad. It was the first adult offense for Pinkney. “I wasn’t really worried,” Pinkney said in a recent prison interview with The Post. “I knew they were going to let me off easy. ” Pinkney said that he had committed at least a dozen robberies by the time he was arrested. “I saw their scared faces,” he told The Post of his victims. “But I never thought about their feelings. I was just being selfish. ” Pinkney pleaded guilty to attempted robbery, and Judge Anita   suspended his sentence and gave him probation under the Youth Act. “I will give him a Youth Act because I do, and it may be aspirational, believe that people should have an opportunity to change their lives,” she said. But Pinkney didn’t take that opportunity. “I went back to doing the same thing,” he said. “Nothing changed. . . . They just gave me the Youth Act and let me go right back out there. They ain’t really care. ”     Rico Myers (Metropolitan Police Department)     Matthew Shlonsky (Metropolitan Police Department)    In February 2015, five months into his probation, Pinkney shot Rico Myers four times during a daytime PCP deal. He pleaded guilty to   murder and is serving a   sentence in federal prison in Pennsylvania. “I know I could have been better. It’s just what I chose,” said Pinkney, who is now 20. “It’s crazy, because my brain is not even fully developed yet. ” Judge   declined to comment for this story. In at least 30 homicide cases, defendants had received Youth Act sentences more than once before  —   turning a second chance into a third or even fourth opportunity to return to the community. Christopher Proctor, Andre Dudley and a third person are charged in the August 2015 killing of Matthew Shlonsky, a    American University graduate who was caught in crossfire near the Shaw Metro Station. Proctor had received two sentences under the Youth Act, including one for attempted theft in 2010. Dudley had received three sentences under the Youth Act, including one in 2014 for escaping from a youth detention facility. Both have pleaded not guilty in the shooting of Shlonsky.    Jermaine Hailes (Prince George’s County Police)  “The program isn’t working, because people are dying,” said Brendan Walsh, a fraternity brother of Shlonsky’s. “The government has some culpability in that. ”  On New Year’s Day in 2007, a    woman, Willa Kynard, was walking with her cane when a young man jumped out of a white van, pointed a gun at her and demanded her purse. “Oh, Jesus, don’t let him shoot me,” Kynard thought, according to court documents. The van eventually crashed after a police chase, and Jermaine Hailes, then 16, who was found hiding in a dumpster, was linked to two other robberies that night. He was charged as an adult and pleaded guilty to one count of armed robbery. Judge Harold Cushenberry cited the Youth Act in sentencing Hailes to three years in prison, two years less than the mandatory minimum. Cushenberry declined to comment for this story. After his release from prison, Hailes shot    Melvin Pate in the face in 2010 during a robbery in Maryland. Pate, who was paralyzed, was able to identify Hailes as his attacker by blinking in response to being shown Hailes’s picture in a photo lineup. Pate died two years after the shooting, and Hailes was convicted this year of   murder. A Prince George’s County judge sentenced him to 70 years in prison.

(Family photo)  ‘Left of liberalism’ The District’s Youth Act was modeled after a failed federal law that was drafted in the 1940s for a different kind of criminal in a much different time. Members of Congress sought a way to curb juvenile delinquency, including clearing the records of soldiers returning from World War II who were getting permanent rap sheets with convictions for disorderly conduct, petty theft or assault. The Federal Youth Corrections Act, passed in 1950, applied to youthful offenders charged with federal crimes throughout the United States and all crimes in the District of Columbia. The goal was rehabilitation, not punishment. Congress eventually helped fund construction of a youth center at the site of the Lorton prison in Fairfax County, Va. to house most Youth Act prisoners from the District. There, the sleeping quarters resembled a college campus, and inmates were required to wear coats and ties. The Lorton Youth Center had a printing plant, a dairy farm and a furniture factory for vocational training.     An inmate sits on his bed in a dorm room at the Lorton Reformatory in Lorton, Va. in 1996. (James A.   Washington Post)     Inmates were gradually being moved from the prison in Lorton in the late 1990s. (Dennis   The Washington Post)    But riots broke out repeatedly in the 1960s and ’70s, pushing prison officials to impose more   time. By the early 1980s, rising crime rates were souring the country on rehabilitation. In the District, residents overwhelmingly voted to implement mandatory minimum prison terms of five years for violent crimes committed with guns. In 1984, Congress repealed the federal Youth Act, in part because there was little evidence that the law was effective. The D. C. Council and   Barry expressed shock and disgust. Wilhelmina J. Rolark (D)   of the D. C. Council’s Judiciary Committee, drafted a law for the District. Rolark, who died in 2006, said “extra care” needed to be taken to prevent young black men from being labeled as career criminals. Barry’s administration argued that many violent crimes should be   for Youth Act sentences. But Rolark’s committee said all crimes except for murder and a second violent crime committed while armed would be eligible for Youth Act sentencing. Rolark’s committee passed the bill 3 to 1. John Ray, now a lawyer, was the lone no vote.    John Ray, now an attorney, talks about the Youth Rehabilitation Act in the District. (Linda   Washington Post)  “I consider myself a liberal, but I put those three as left of liberalism,” Ray said. “I grew up in Georgia, and everyone around me was poor, but I didn’t  —   and still don’t  —   accept the position that you should get a pass for violent crime because you’re poor or you didn’t come from the best family. I think people must be held responsible for their conduct. ” On July 11, 1985, the council passed the bill, 9 to 4, with Ray (D) having registered his protest, flipping his vote. Barry signed it into law that month. But in the late 1990s, facing the threat of bankruptcy, D. C. officials agreed to a federal bailout that transferred supervision of inmates to the federal government. The Lorton Youth Center closed, and D. C. prisoners were dispersed across the country to federal prisons, where there were no rehabilitation programs expressly targeting them. Eric H. Holder Jr. then a deputy U. S. attorney general, led a commission reviewing all D. C. criminal laws to bring them in line with federal statutes. “No other single issue provoked as much debate in the Commission as did the Youth Act,” the commission said in 1998. Commission members were concerned about judges’ using the Youth Act to override mandatory minimums and considered banning the act for violent offenders. “Several commissioners observed that the inclusion of violent youthful offenders destroyed the federal Youth Corrections Act and was wreaking havoc on the D. C. Youth Rehabilitation Act,” the commission wrote. Like all federal inmates, Youth Act offenders would now be required to serve 85 percent of their sentences. But the commission ultimately decided not to take a position on violent offenders. In 2000,  . C. Council member Harold Brazil (D) lobbied for a sentencing reform act that would have excluded most violent felons from the Youth Act. “The Youth Act makes sense for less serious crimes,” Brazil said then. “For the heinous stuff, well, it’s just not going to do much good. ” The Public Defender Service argued that young black men would be irreparably harmed. “If this bill passes as adopted, it will almost certainly increase incarceration rates and racial disparities in the District’s criminal justice system,” wrote Robert Wilkins, chief of special litigation for the service, in an   in The Post. Wilkins is now a judge on the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The law was once again left intact.    Inmates in the south end hallway of the District’s Central Detention Facility. (Linda   Washington Post)  ‘They’re just letting you off’ About half of the young offenders in the age group eligible for Youth Act sentences  —   those younger than 22  —   receive them. Youth Act sentences account for about 15 percent of all felony sentences in D. C. Superior Court. Prosecutors and defense attorneys turn to the law to make plea deals. The Public Defender Service’s manual highlights the Youth Act as a way to get around mandatory prison time for certain violent gun crimes. To ensure at least some prison time in an unpredictable legal system, prosecutors negotiating plea deals often agree to not oppose the application of the Youth Act. “If you try to prosecute a case that is not built on strong evidence, and that defendant is subsequently exonerated, all you have done is emboldened that defendant to believe he can always beat the system,” said Ronald C. Machen Jr. who was U. S. attorney in the District from 2010 to 2015. “He will feel like he is a Teflon Don. ” D. C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) faults prosecutors as willing to offer generous deals to violent criminals. “When they dumb down the charges, over and over, they are missing what’s necessary to put the violent repeat offender away,” he said. Judges are given wide leeway to apply the law. In some cases, judges order inmates at the jail to undergo lengthy evaluations, known as “Youth Act studies. ” The evaluations include interviews with psychologists or social workers. If defendants are not in jail, judges can allow defense attorneys to hire their own experts to conduct the studies. Judges also are authorized to give Youth Act sentences without ordering studies.    Antwon Pitt (Prince George’s County state’s attorney’s office)  Youth Act studies are not made public. The Public Defender Service, D. C. Superior Court judges and jail officials denied requests from The Post to review studies. In 2013, Antwon Pitt was under consideration for a Youth Act sentence after pleading guilty to robbing a D. C. woman and assaulting a police officer. He had already been convicted of aggravated assault and battery in a different case and had received a Youth Act sentence for a misdemeanor. Pitt’s defense attorney argued that he should be eligible for benefits under the law because the author of Pitt’s Youth Act study recommended that approach. “I know,” Judge Heidi Pasichow said. “It’s very rare that people are not recommended, but he’s violent. ” Ultimately, she sentenced Pitt to the statutory minimum for robbery  —   24 months  —   to be served in prison, and gave him a chance to have his record expunged under the Youth Act. About two months after his release from prison, Pitt committed a brutal rape during a home invasion in the Hill East neighborhood of the District. He has since been convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison.  Pasichow declined to comment for this story. No study was done for William Smallwood, who benefited from the Youth Act twice  —   once in an assault case, then in a robbery case  —   before he killed a man about a year and a half later, at age 22.    Rashard Raigns (Metropolitan Police Department)  He pleaded guilty to the   murder of Rashard Raigns and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Smallwood, during a prison interview in West Virginia, said he was surprised that he was twice sentenced under the Youth Act without any evaluation. “The Youth Act is not what it’s cracked up to be,” he told The Post. “They’re just letting you off. But you’re not getting any help. ” A spokesman from the Bureau of Prisons told The Post that the agency realizes the “greater vulnerability” of young adults and works with Youth Act offenders to develop personalized goals to prepare them for a “productive and lasting return to the community. ” Not all judges embrace the Youth Act. Judge Jennifer Anderson, who was hearing a 2010 case involving a defendant who reached for a loaded gun and struggled with police officers, denied his request for the Youth Act. She said the defendant’s conduct was not “a single, isolated event attributable to youthful indiscretion, which is the type of case that is appropriate for the benefit of the Youth Rehabilitation Act in this court’s opinion. ” This year, criminal justice officials in the District met with The Post’s editorial board and a group of Post reporters to defend the system in the aftermath of the Pitt case. During the meeting, Judge Leibovitz, head of the Superior Court’s criminal division, characterized the Youth Act as simply a way for offenders to have their records expunged if they do not get in trouble again. “It’s words on a page, unless and until the person is successful,” she said. Leibovitz disputed the idea that Youth Act sentences equate to leniency. She said the court does not keep statistics on Youth Act sentences that go below mandatory minimums. The Post’s review of 136   sentences under the Youth Act showed that, on average, they were two years less than regular   sentences. The Post found at least 20   cases committed with guns that resulted in Youth Act sentences below the   mandatory minimum since 2010. An additional 35   cases included the stipulation in plea deals that imitation guns were used in the commission of the crimes. Those deals sometimes were contradicted by sworn statements from the defendants that described their possession of real guns. The Post found one case in which a man convicted of   murder, Kurtis Faison, was sentenced under the Youth Act, although the law expressly prohibits the inclusion of convicted murderers. Judges and prosecutors declined to comment on the legality of the 2013 sentence issued by Judge Henry Greene. ‘  quarterback’ Interim D. C. Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham said community members are often frustrated when they see violent criminals return to the streets.    Bijon Brown (Courtesy of Metro Transit Police)  “They will look to the police and ask us, ‘What the heck happened?’ ” he said. “And that can be frustrating for our officers. ” Newsham said he thinks repeat violent offenders illustrate how the criminal justice system has failed to protect the public. “Someone, somewhere along the line, should have done something to prevent that from happening,” he said. The Post identified more than 200 criminals who received Youth Act sentences more than once for weapons offenses or violent crimes in the past decade. In February 2015, Bijon Brown lived in Forest Ridge, a public housing complex in Southeast Washington where   numbers mark the apartment buildings. A short hike down a hill leads to the turf of a rival neighborhood crew. On a Monday morning on Presidents’ Day, Brown confronted two teenage boys near a small basketball court. He opened fire, striking one of them in the leg. Brown later admitted to the shooting and told police officers that he had thrown the gun into the Anacostia River. Brown’s defense attorney said there had been an ongoing neighborhood feud. The attorney said Brown had only been trying to scare the boys.    Judge Anita   (Michael   The Washington Post)  “I understand I made a mistake and all that, but, I’m just trying to get my life in order, that’s all,” Brown told Judge  . Brown pleaded guilty to attempted assault with a dangerous weapon. The prosecutor and defense attorney agreed on a   sentence, with all time suspended. Prosecutor Scott Ray said in court filings that Brown had accepted responsibility for his actions and had saved the system considerable resources by swiftly taking the plea deal. The prosecutor did not oppose the Youth Act for Brown’s case. The judge gave Brown the   sentence and placed him on probation under the Youth Act. “The hope is that, you know, this will be the last time that we all see you and that you will have a productive life,” the judge said. On Aug. 21, 2015  —   29 days into his probation  —   Brown opened fire aboard a Metrobus after a rival neighborhood crew surrounded the bus. The shooting was captured on video, and police quickly identified him as a suspect. After the identification, Mayor Bowser held a news conference to put a spotlight on Brown. “These are the folks that are driving a lot of the crime in the District,” she said, questioning why he had been released so quickly. Three weeks later, police officers found Brown hiding in a friend’s closet. He pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm, with an agreement that prosecutors would not request more than 15 months’ incarceration. This time, prosecutors opposed giving Brown the Youth Act. “He took that entire bus full of people and he took them into a battle zone,” prosecutor William Schurmann said. Brown told the judge that he planned to turn his life around and move away from his violent neighborhood once he was released from jail. “The picture has been painted of me that maybe I am a monster or I am somebody that may just want to carry around guns shooting at people,” he told   in April. “I just want to let everybody know that I am not the monster that everybody looks at me to be. ”   sentenced him to a year and a day in jail under the Youth Act. By August 2016, Brown was out of jail, with credit applied for the time he had already served. Nine days after Brown’s release, a man reported that he had been held at gunpoint during a carjacking near the Rhode Island Avenue Metro station in Northeast Washington. Later, during a police chase, the fleeing car crashed into a front yard, and its three occupants fled. Brown was caught. He was charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle. His case is pending. In September,   took a moment on the bench to reflect on Brown’s past sentencings. She cast blame on the juvenile victims of the first shooting, saying they had been “terrorizing” the neighborhood. Then she said the Metrobus shooting had looked like “something out of ‘Straight Outta Compton’ ” because of the “mob” of men that confronted Brown. “I really think it is easy to   quarterback judges as we are making decisions that have more context,” she said, staring at a Post reporter taking notes in the courtroom. “Because otherwise, you just get a computer and it spits out a sentence. ”   declined a Post request to comment on the Brown case. ‘He’s 19 years old’ On Oct. 3, 2013, Mikiyas Getachew took a taxi to his home in Northeast Washington. It was about 2:45 a. m. and as he fumbled with his key to open the door, he felt the barrel of a gun against the back of his head.    The former residence of Mikiyas Getachew and his family in Northeast Washington, where they were robbed at gunpoint in 2013. (Linda   Washington Post)  He looked up to see men in ski masks. They took his wallet, Tag Heuer watch and cellphone. They forced him to unlock the door, pushing him inside. The commotion awoke his mother and his fiancee, Nava. The robbers held them at gunpoint on their knees. The men carried televisions out of bedrooms, grabbed laptops and took Nava’s $5, 000 engagement ring. The men loaded the items into the victims’ cars, a Nissan Altima and a Honda CRV, and took off. The men set the vehicles ablaze six miles away, behind a shuttered school in Southeast. Later that day, D. C. police surrounded an abandoned house a few blocks away from where the vehicles were set alight and found the suspects and goods stolen from the Getachew home. The man prosecutors said had the gun at the start of the crime, Andre Townsend, then 19, was on pretrial release in a case in which he allegedly assaulted two young men with a handgun. Getachew pleaded for harsh penalties for the perpetrators: “What we would like to see is justice being served to the fullest against these defendants. ” Nava and Mikiyas Getachew never found the engagement ring. They have since moved away from the District. If Townsend had been convicted of all 18 charges against him, he could have faced 29 to 65 years under sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors said Townsend had expressed remorse. They offered a plea that dropped 14 of 18 charges, including three of armed kidnapping.    Judge William Jackson (Michael   The Washington Post)  But prosecutor Ben Schrader told Judge William Jackson that the Youth Act was not appropriate for Townsend. “This is not a   robbery case,” he said. “It’s a concerted effort by a group of people to commit a pretty heinous act. ” Defense attorney Kelli Neptune said the authors of a Youth Act study had recommended that Townsend receive the benefits of the law. “The Youth Act is given even in homicide cases,” she told Judge Jackson. Townsend said he wanted to speak. “I want to say I apologize to the victim and my family, and that’s it,” Townsend said. Judge Jackson said he thought the sentence in the plea deal reached between the defense and the prosecution was light, but he accepted it. He sentenced Townsend to 48 months for armed burglary and 48 months for armed robbery, to be served consecutively. Although the judge said it was a “very close” decision, he decided to apply the Youth Act to Townsend, who is to be released in 2020. “He’s 19 years old,” Jackson said. “So, that’s why I’m doing it. ” Shareem Hall, whose fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime, accepted responsibility for his actions and pleaded guilty to several charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime of violence while armed, which carries a mandatory prison term of at least five years. “I want to say that I’m truly, truly sorry to the victims. . . . I just pray that they forgive me,” the    said to Judge Jackson in 2015. “I no longer want to take from people anymore. ” Invoking the Youth Act, Jackson suspended Hall’s entire   prison sentence and set him free on probation. Earlier this year, police identified Hall as a suspect in the slaying of Dodds, the transgender woman shot during an attempted robbery on July 4 in Northeast Washington. Hall and a   now face the charge of “  murder while   murder. ” Their preliminary hearings are scheduled for Dec. 9. When police caught up with Hall in September, he was wearing a gray backpack. Inside, police said, was a Smith & Wesson .  handgun loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition.  Washington Post researchers Jennifer Jenkins, Alice Crites and Magda   and graduate students Shaun Courtney and Teaganne Finn, contributed to this report. Courtney and Finn are attached to The Post’s investigative unit through a program at American University.   How The Post studied the Youth Rehabilitation Act  To study the implementation of the District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act, The Washington Post drew from a number of sources, combining information where possible for a more complete understanding of the effects of the law. The Post requested and received a data set from the D. C. Sentencing Commission containing all 3, 188 felony sentences issued under the Youth Act from January 2010 to April 2016. The data did not contain information on the identities of those sentenced but included the ages of offenders, dates of conviction, charges at conviction and a statistical weighting of their criminal histories. The Post wrote software to search the Districts’s online court database to identify all publicly available criminal cases, felony and misdemeanor, 168, 265 between January 2007 and November 2016. The Post then pulled docket information on every case and analyzed the data, identifying all felony and misdemeanor crimes sentenced under the Youth Act that have not been expunged. By matching crimes and sentencing dates to the Sentencing Commission’s data, The Post was able to identify 85 percent of the 3, 188 felony offenders sentenced under the Youth Act since 2010. The Post also identified upward of 3, 000 misdemeanor crimes for which sentences were given under the Youth Act. Because the Sentencing Commission does not track these crimes, reporters could not determine how many convictions have been expunged because sentences have been successfully completed. The Post also requested data on those arrested on homicide charges in the District since 2010 from the Metropolitan Police Department. Using data pulled from the District’s court website, reporters identified 121 individuals arrested on homicide charges who previously were sentenced under the Youth Act. Reporters verified the identity of each offender by pulling files at D. C. Superior Court. "
"    CITY | This is part of a continuing series that will examine issues related to repeat violent offenders in the District of Columbia. Part I | Part II | Part III        On a warm summer night, Kristin Van Goor was jolted awake by the sound of knocking. She hurried down the wooden staircase in her pajamas. Through the windows, she saw red and blue police lights flashing, and her husband, Dave, on the doorstep. A detective in a police cruiser shouted, “Are you all good?” Dave gave a nod and walked inside their Hill East home, just after midnight. Dave paced in the living room. The memories spilled out in jagged pieces. He remembered the black gun held to his head. Three young men, wearing black masks over their faces, surrounded him as he walked home from the   Metro station about 11:30 p. m. on Aug. 20, 2015. They grabbed his backpack. They took his phone and laptop, his wallet and keys. They dug deeper still into his pockets and fished out the last bit of loose change. Just get through this, Dave thought. Just survive. During the days and months to follow, one young man would be linked to the crime. In a span of several months, he would leave a trail of terror across the region, only to be granted a break under the Youth Rehabilitation Act, a D. C. law often used by judges seeking to give second chances to young violent offenders. The man’s case is one of more than 3, 000 felony sentences handed down since 2010 under the law, which allows for leniency in some sentences and the opportunity for offenders to emerge with no criminal record. The story that brings together that young man, the Van Goors and other victims illuminates the difficulty of trying to protect a young man’s future and society at the same time. It also shows how victims suffer not just during the crime, but also in the aftermath  —   how the system can leave them disillusioned and deliver not justice but frustration. This account is based on interviews with the victims, and on police reports and court records. On that night in August 2015, Dave Van Goor saw only the masked men surrounding him. One of them demanded his iPhone passcode. The man held the gun sideways and pointed it toward Dave’s temple.  “Right     now!” he yelled. After they got the code, the men sprinted into an alleyway and fled into the darkness. Dave ran to get help. Good Samaritans in a nearby apartment building called 911. Police officers took his statement and drove him back to the safety of his home. But Dave and Kristin didn’t feel safe. Not that night. And not in the weeks and months to follow. It was their first night of a   journey in a new role: victims.  Both had earned PhDs in scientific fields. Dave, then 38, was a student at George Washington University Law School and worked for a law firm; Kristin, 35, had a job at a biopharmaceutical company. The criminals who brazenly robbed Dave at gunpoint, on a residential street just a mile and a half from the U. S. Capitol, now had the keys to their house and car. “How are we supposed to sleep?” Kristin asked. “We are sitting ducks. ” One police officer told the Van Goors not to worry. Criminals never return to the scene of the crime, he said.   years of experience told him so. But the Van Goors worried anyway. At 1 a. m. they walked outside and fastened a club over the steering wheel of their black Volkswagen Tiguan SUV. The key to the club was already in the hands of the robbers. The couple hoped the robbers might not think of it. The Van Goors retreated to the basement with their jittery labradoodle, Darwin. There were credit cards to cancel. Insurance companies to call. Locks to be changed. Dave huddled with Kristin and Darwin in the basement. He flipped on the TV and sipped some Scotch. The whisky dulled his nerves and soothed his anger. He drank a little more and drifted to sleep just before dawn.    The missing car:   7:45 a. m. Friday, Aug. 21, 2015     Kristin Van Goor (Linda   Washington Post)  Kristin was up early the next morning, with plans to drive to Baltimore for a work meeting. The Van Goors had parked their Tiguan behind a motorcycle less than a block from their home on A Street NE. The motorcycle was there. But the SUV was gone, just an empty space in its place. Kristin shouted to a family across the street, “Did you happen to see a black Tiguan parked here?” They had not. Kristin ran to tell Dave. “Are you     kidding me?” he said. She called 911 about 8 a. m. She called again at 8:39 a. m. A dispatcher told her that they were busy with   calls. At 11:26 a. m. Kristin called once more. Officer Topaz Proctor responded, and Kristin yelled at him on the doorstep. Dave tried to calm her. She apologized for snapping at the officer. Now, they had more paperwork to handle: A new police statement. A call to the car insurance company. And a contract for a rental car.    The first clue:   Monday, Aug. 24, 2015  In the Van Goors’ mail was an envelope with no return address. Inside the envelope: a handwritten note, dated Aug. 21, 2015  —   the day after the armed robbery. The envelope also contained a reimbursement check from her company, made out to Kristin, for $95.   Hello Ms. Van Goor,   My name is Brenda, and on my way to work this morning I found this check near Texas Ave. and Dubois St. in S. E.   Days before the robbery, Kristin had signed the check and asked Dave to deposit it for her. It had been in his stolen backpack. Kristin immediately called Brenda to thank her and to tell her about the robbery. Then, she called the police. She thought the note was an important clue. If the check was found on a street in the Benning Ridge neighborhood, their Tiguan had to be nearby. Maybe the robbers lived in the neighborhood. She got through to a D. C. police detective who said that he knew the neighborhood quite well. “Go look for my car,” she begged. He later told the Van Goors that he spent a few hours looking but had no luck.    The next victim:  7:50 a. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015     Kimberly   recalls being robbed last year by a young man with a gun while walking in an alley adjacent to where she worked at the Center City Public Charter School in Southeast Washington. (Linda   Washington Post)  Kimberly   40, had just a few days to prepare for the first week of school at Center City, a charter school in the Hill East neighborhood. As the assistant principal, she had plenty of work to do. On her drive to school,    sang along to gospel tunes in her Honda Civic. Just before 8 a. m. she parked in a lot beside the school and unloaded three bags: a Michael Kors purse, a computer bag and a Kate Spade workbag filled with school supplies, a hammer and paint to redecorate her office. Still humming, she walked through the parking lot and into an alley on her way to the front door of the school. Then she saw a young man, dressed in a loose white   and black pants with a skullcap on his head, lingering nearby in the alley. “I saw him clear as day,” she said. The public high school, Eastern, was just down the block. Classes had already begun there, and she thought he was probably a student at Eastern. She passed him and then heard his footsteps scraping the gravel on the pavement behind her. She moved to the right, thinking he wanted to pass her along the   fence. Suddenly, he grabbed her purse strap, and she turned to face him. She racked her brain. She had taught for 17 years in the District. Maybe she knew his name. If I can call his name, maybe he won’t do this, she thought. He raised his shirt, flashing the handle of a gun tucked into his waistband. He put a finger to his mouth, signaling for her to be quiet. She then handed over her workbag and her purse, containing her wallet, cash, credit cards, driver’s license, and keys to her Civic and her home. He pointed at her computer bag, which held her MacBook. “Do you want that?” he asked, with chilling calm. “Yes,” she begged. “Please. ” Inside, there were irreplaceable work files. Student projects. Years of lesson plans. “Nah, give me that, too,” he told her. He took her last bag and then motioned for her to walk away. Her back toward him, she walked down the alley along the   fence toward the street. Her eyes were closed. She feared he was going to shoot her. She willed herself to keep walking. Just be numb. At the end of the alley, her eyes were still clenched shut. She opened her eyes, turned left and sprinted up the steps to the charter school. “Help me!” she screamed. “I’ve been robbed!”      Kimberly   a former assistant principal, was walking toward her school when she was robbed by a youth armed with a gun. She describes her encounter with the gunman. (Whitney  )      A crime alert: 8:15 a. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  A block away, Kristin Van Goor stood in line at Mia’s, a local coffee shop. It had been a week since her husband was robbed. She read a new email on her phone. There was an urgent neighborhood crime alert: Someone had just been robbed at gunpoint, and the robber was on the loose in Hill East. Kristin had planned to walk to the Metro from the coffee shop, but she changed her mind. She decided to return home and drive her rental car instead.    A stakeout: Midmorning, Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  Dispatchers broadcast details of the crime to police officers in the neighborhood. Officer Proctor heard the description of the robber  —   of a young black male with a black skull cap and white  . Just moments before the robbery, the officer had seen a young man driving a black Volkswagen Tiguan who matched that description.    Kimberly   (Linda   Washington Post)  Kimberly  ’s husband drove into the District from their home in Upper Marlboro, Md. with the family’s spare car keys. She and her husband wanted to quickly move her Honda Civic away from the school parking lot. The gunman had the keys, and they thought he might come back for it. They moved the car back to their home. Officers staked out the school parking lot for several hours, thinking the man might return to try to find the car. At 10:56 a. m. they once again spotted the young black man, driving the Tiguan near the parking lot. When they tried to stop him, he fled east on East Capitol Street. About three miles from the start of the pursuit by police, the driver crashed the Tiguan into a city   machine near 51st Street and Ayers Place SE. The driver and two other men bailed out of the car. After a brief foot chase, the officers caught the driver but lost sight of the other men. Inside the SUV, they recovered  ’s ID card. On the passenger side, they found a .  semiautomatic pistol on the floor.    A ‘ ’ identification: 12:35 p. m. Friday, Aug. 28, 2015  After they caught the suspect, police called   at home. She needed to return to the school, where a police detective would be waiting for her.   sat in the back seat of the police cruiser as a detective drove her on East Capitol toward Southern Avenue. She was going to see the gunman in person. They arrived about a block away from the scene of the crash. The detective told   that he would record her reactions.    The Van Goors’ totaled Volkswagen Tiguan. (Courtesy of the Van Goor family)    would be asked to take a live look at the young man in handcuffs to see whether she could confirm that he was the man who robbed her.   was confident that she would be able to identify him. She had made an effort to stare into the young man’s eyes. She would not forget them. In clear view, they walked the young man toward the police SUV in the street. She worried that he could see her through the car windows and knew where she worked. He had her ID. He knew where she lived. She knew it was him. The pants were the same. He had changed his shirt, but he still wore the skullcap. She made the identification. But then she got jittery. Oh, my gosh, she thought. I’m about to send a black male to jail. She asked to see him once more. She thought of her own son. If you’re about to send this young man to jail, you better know for sure, she thought. She identified him for the second time, 100 percent sure. Later, police asked her to come to the station, where she collected some of the items that were recovered from the Tiguan. When the detective briefly left the room, she peered over his desk. There was a police photo of the young man who robbed her. And for the first time, a name: Joshua Mayo.      Kimberly   describes what it was like to identify the man with a gun who robbed her. (Whitney  )      Preliminary hearing: Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015:  After being arrested on suspicion of armed robbery, Mayo was taken to Children’s National Medical Center in the District for minor injuries sustained in the crash. He was two weeks shy of his 18th birthday, but he would be charged as an adult in the armed robbery of  .    Joshua Mayo (Prince George’s County Department of Corrections)  The Aug. 29 charging papers also revealed a direct link between Mayo and the Van Goors: The Tiguan he crashed was their stolen SUV. Three days later, Mayo appeared in D. C. Superior Court for a preliminary hearing. Magistrate Judge Frederick Sullivan heard testimony from Officer Proctor, who described spotting Mayo in the Tiguan near the school parking lot, wearing a skullcap. Sullivan said there was “plenty” of probable cause to move forward. “Your client’s involved himself in extremely dangerous conduct,” Sullivan told the defense attorney. “He’s sticking a gun into people and taking their property . . . and then he’s fleeing in an automobile with other guys in the automobile and it looks as though there may be a couple of different crimes here. ” He ordered Mayo held without bond. A Pretrial Services official noted that there were also two arrest warrants for Mayo in connection with armed robberies in Prince George’s County, Md. in July. On Sept. 4, 2015, the Van Goors learned from a police officer that their stolen SUV had been recovered. They were told few details, only that their vehicle had been used as a getaway car in an armed robbery.    Joshua Mayo: Early fall 2015  Armed with the name “Joshua Mayo,”   took matters into her own hands. She wanted to know why Joshua was not in school on the day of the robbery, the first week of public school in the District. Her mind was racked with questions for him: Was it fun? Were you just doing this for kicks? Or were you doing this because you thought it was the way to survive? Assistant U. S. Attorney Vivien Cockburn was assigned to her case. “All the prosecutors would say is that he had been in a little bit of trouble,”   said. “They kept saying, ‘He’s done this before.’ ” She received an official letter telling her that she was the victim of a crime. It laid out her rights for compensation. The price of changing her locks  —   $716  —   could be covered by a victim’s fund. Meanwhile, the Van Goors were in the dark. “Every time I called the prosecutor’s office, they had no idea what was going on,” Kristin said. “When I tried to call back, I was never able to figure out if Dave’s robbery had been reviewed by a prosecutor or even been assigned to a prosecutor. ” No charges had been filed against Mayo for the crimes involving their family: the armed robbery of Dave and the theft and destruction of their SUV. Eventually, they learned from Cockburn that Joshua Mayo was the man who crashed their SUV. At 8:30 p. m. on Sept. 14, a woman named Rekha Patil showed up on the Van Goors’ doorstep. She asked for Dave, acting friendly, Kristin recalled. Kristin assumed she was a law school classmate. But Patil was an investigator for the D. C. Public Defender Service. She was there to help defend Joshua Mayo. She wanted to ask about the robbery. Kristin screamed at her to leave, immediately. Like Kristin, Kimberly   also had a bitter   with a woman from the Public Defender Service. She could not remember the woman’s name but said she did not think it was Patil. The woman, who had jet black hair pulled back into a ponytail, showed up at her school on Oct. 1, claiming to work for the defense team of Joshua Mayo. “I really want to talk to you because I don’t think you know what you’re doing,” the woman said, according to  ’s account. “You’re about to send an innocent young man to jail. ” “He wasn’t a young man the day he robbed me,”   said she told her. Patil referred a reporter to her bosses for comment. In a statement to The Washington Post, the Public Defender Service responded that its investigators have a constitutional right and duty to attempt to interview witnesses to crimes as part of the defense case. “PDS investigators need to, often under very tight time constraints, attempt to speak with any witnesses and victims to get their side of the story,” said Janet Mitchell, PDS supervising attorney. “Investigators are instructed to be persistent but also professional and respectful. ”    Kimberly   in the alley where she was robbed. (Linda   Washington Post)     The makings of a deal: Friday, Oct. 2, 2015  The next day, Mayo was offered a deal by the U. S. attorney’s office. The paperwork revealed yet another twist in Mayo’s brief but violent history.  He had been linked to a third armed robbery in the District of Columbia. In April 2015, a group of young men approached a    man in Southeast Washington and stole his phone. They also shot him in his right arm. With the stolen Samsung Galaxy phone, they made a selfie video of joy rides around the city. In the video, they blow smoke and flash a gun, laughing. What they did not know, however, was that the video automatically uploaded to the victim’s online cloud storage. Their faces were clearly visible. The victim turned the video over to police. In August, the D. C. police posted the video online and asked for tips. An anonymous tipster identified Joshua Mayo. On Sept. 4, after he had been charged with armed robbery in  ’s case, Mayo was charged with another count of armed robbery for taking the    man’s cellphone. Prosecutors wrote that Mayo, under D. C. law, would face a mandatory minimum prison term of five years for each armed robbery, since they were separate crimes. If convicted, he would be spending a mandatory 10 years in prison. But they offered him a generous plea deal. They would dismiss the charge of the first armed robbery  —   connected with the cellphone theft and shooting  —   in exchange for a plea to a misdemeanor charge of receipt of stolen property. The misdemeanor carried a penalty of 180 days in jail. For the second   charge  —   the crime against Kimberly    —   prosecutors would agree to accept an admission by Mayo of committing an armed robbery with an imitation weapon, even though police officers had recovered a real firearm  —   the .  semiautomatic pistol. The significance of the imitation weapon: Mayo would no longer be subject to the mandatory minimum of five years for armed robbery.  “I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ ”   said. “I knew damn well it wasn’t a toy gun. ” Richard Tischner, chief of the Superior Court Division for the U. S. attorney’s office, said “imitation weapon” clauses are sometimes stipulated as part of plea negotiations, even if real guns are used in the crimes. “It’s not a lie,” he told The Post. “It’s a concession to the case. ”    Signing the deal: 10 a. m. Friday, Oct. 9, 2015  Mayo pleaded guilty before Judge Todd Edelman. The judge approved a defense attorney’s request for a Youth Rehabilitation Act study for Mayo, who was now 18 years old.   had heard of the law before. As a teacher, she had worked with young men who had received the benefit of the law. “Tell me your thoughts about it,” Cockburn asked her, according to  ’s recollection.   said she opposed it in Mayo’s case. “In some cases, I just feel like it doesn’t work,” she said. “Especially if he’s been in trouble already. At some point and time, you have to be fully responsible for your actions. ” The   plea deal had been infuriating to   . And now, Mayo was up for the Youth Rehabilitation Act. “It really is a game,” she told The Post.      Kimberly   a victim of armed robbery, describes how she felt about the plea deal the assailant was offered under the Youth Rehabilitation Act. (Whitney  )      A victim’s connection: Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015  It had been six weeks since the car crash, and the Van Goors had not been allowed to see their vehicle. Finally, on a Wednesday morning, the Van Goors traveled to an impound lot in Southwest Washington to take a look at their totaled Tiguan. The front end was completely bashed in, and the car reeked of mold. The Van Goors desperately wanted one item back: Dave’s keychain. It held a small memento in honor of his brother, who had died several years before. The SUV was full of rubbish: umbrellas,   frozen lunches and cologne. The cup holders were filled with cigarette ashes. They could not find the key chain. But they did find a debit card, in a side pocket of the SUV. It belonged to a woman named Kimberly  . Kristin did a Google search for the woman’s name. She saw that the woman worked as an assistant principal at Center City charter school. Later that afternoon, Kristin called the school and asked to speak with  . The two women swapped stories over the phone.   told Kristin that prosecutors had already offered Mayo a plea deal for the school robbery. He had accepted it. Kristin was stunned. No one from the U. S. attorney’s office had told her anything about a plea offer. The offer made a reference to Mayo’s crashing the Van Goors’ SUV but guaranteed that he would face no further charges in the incident.    The indictment: Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016  While Joshua Mayo was in the D. C. jail awaiting sentencing, a grand jury impaneled in Prince George’s County indicted him on charges of armed robbery, robbery,   assault,   assault, use of a firearm in a crime of violence, theft and conspiracy. Meanwhile, jail officials in the District conducted a Youth Rehabilitation Act study ordered by Judge Edelman to see whether Mayo could benefit from rehabilitative treatment. The results would not be disclosed to the public, but they would be given to Edelman.    Conflicting thoughts: Winter 2016    was on the fence about attending the sentencing. “At the beginning, I was all for it,” she said. “As time went on, the fear set in. ” She refused to go outside for recess. She carried her car keys in her bra. She began carrying a small Taser in her purse. “He will be able to sleep,” she said of Mayo. “I don’t sleep. I watch my back. ” Cockburn told her, repeatedly, that they desperately needed her voice for Judge Edelman’s consideration at the sentencing.   had one request for the prosecutor: If she attended, could she give two books to Mayo? She wanted to share “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “Cooked,” the memoir of a prison cook who turned his life around and became a famous casino chef. Cockburn, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told   that it would not be possible.   did not see the point of attending the sentencing.  No one called the Van Goors to inform them of the sentencing date. They learned of it while researching the case through court records. Kristin planned to show up, mainly because she wanted to see Mayo’s face. She believed that he was the young man who held a gun to her husband’s head. But the sentencing was postponed two months, and by that point, the   frustrations had worn her down. She did not attend.      The wife of an   victim describes her reaction to the lenient sentence the robber received under the District’s Youth Rehabilitation Act. (Whitney  )      The sentencing: Tuesday, March 15, 2016  On the day of the sentencing, Cockburn apologized to Judge Edelman for  ’s absence. “I urged the victim to come. And I wanted  —   unfortunately, she is not here today. I wanted to very briefly describe this person to you,” she said. “The victim is this tiny lady. She only comes up to my shoulder, but she is a spitfire. She is a very lively, engaged woman. ” But Cockburn said that over several months, she saw the victim suffer. “She speaks to me on the phone and tells me how she’s now, and has been, afraid to even step out of her own building, and she is the assistant principal,” she said. “This is not a woman that is shaken easily, and yet now, she looks over her shoulder, she finds other people to go outside, and she is struggling. ” Cockburn asked for five years prison time. She said the totality of Mayo’s violent crimes should warrant appropriate punishment. Defense attorney John Fowler, from the Public Defender Service, said the government was too focused on punishment and deterrence rather than rehabilitation. He said Mayo should serve no more than 36 months in prison. Fowler told the judge that Mayo’s upbringing had been plagued by health problems and difficulties in D. C. public schools. Mayo dropped out of school after the 10th grade, according to court records. Fowler told the judge that Mayo had suffered from a heart ailment since he was a toddler. “I don’t think he ever got the support that he needed,” Fowler told the judge. Fowler said that Mayo had “taken advantage of the very limited opportunities” at the D. C. jail. He was attending classes there five days a week to work toward his GED. The attorney said he worried that prison would be particularly hard on Mayo. For instance, if Mayo got into a fight, or took a punch to the face, he said that the consequences could be severe. “He doesn’t have the health of an  ” Fowler said. “He doesn’t have the heart of an   . ” Judge Edelman asked Mayo whether he would like to say anything. “I want to say that I apologize for my actions,” Mayo told the judge. “I own up to them. And I don’t want everybody to say I’m a bad person. ” Edelman, who declined to comment for this article, indicated that he was conflicted. “We have such a young person, who has so much of his life ahead of him and who has arguably been very let down by, for example, our educational system,” he said. “And on the other hand, you have such a chilling act or set of acts here. . . . It’s an armed robbery with a .  handgun. ” Prosecutors had brought up the links between Mayo and the robbery of   the cellphone case and the Van Goor case. “The government submits that the defendant’s connection to three armed robberies is not a coincidence, and indicates a disturbing pattern of criminal activity by the defendant,” the prosecutor’s sentencing memorandum states. Edelman acknowledged that there was “some connection” between Mayo and the two other armed robberies in the District. The judge also made reference to the pending Prince George’s   case, which could bring a sentence of 10 to 15 years. Additionally, the judge mentioned that Mayo had a firearm charge in family court, a juvenile matter that was not part of his adult record. Ultimately, the judge sentenced Mayo to serve 42 months in prison for the armed robbery, with credit for the five months he had already spent in jail. The sentence was 18 months below the mandatory minimum for armed robberies with real guns. The judge also added six months for the misdemeanor    charge connected to the cellphone armed robbery and shooting, for a total of 48 months. Edelman granted the defense attorney’s request for Youth Rehabilitation Act status, saying that it was appropriate to treat Mayo as a youthful offender. And, as the judge pointed out, the prosecutor had not objected. The leniency was infuriating to  . Mayo was getting time shaved off, but she would be scared for life. Hell no, she thought. No one is shaving that off for me.   eventually left her job at the charter school and moved to an alternative school for young adults. She did it for Joshua, she said. “I still believe that no one wakes up and just says, ‘This is who I am,’ ” she said. “Somewhere, he was made into this. Somewhere, he has gotten lost. When I looked into Josh’s eyes that day, I saw a kid. I didn’t see a robber. ” She stopped herself. “Shame on me, maybe,” she said.       Kimberly   describes the new path she is taking with her career as a result of what happened to her. (Whitney  )     The aftermath: Summer 2016  Last spring, Mayo was briefly sent to a federal prison in New Jersey, where he began serving his sentence. This summer, he was extradited to Maryland to face charges in the July 29 armed robberies. Mayo, now 19, pleaded guilty in October to possession of a firearm and two counts of armed robbery and faces between five and 15 years of prison time. He is scheduled to be sentenced in January. Mayo, through his   attorney in Maryland, declined to comment for this article. There have been no charges filed in the armed robbery of Dave Van Goor. The case remains under investigation, according to William Miller, a spokesman for the U. S. attorney’s office. Miller said his office disputes the victims’ assertions about their interactions with prosecutors  —   he said his office had had “extensive communication” with the Van Goor family and contested  ’s account that she was upset about the plea deal. But he declined to provide details or make prosecutors available for interviews. “Generally speaking, we devote considerable time and resources to ensuring that victims are kept informed and heard throughout proceedings, and their views are given strong consideration,” Miller said. The Van Goors tried to move on with their lives, but the fear and the frustration persisted. They still wanted justice. At a minimum, they thought Mayo should be charged with wrecking their SUV. “It’s all so frustrating,” Kristin told The Post. “They arrested the man who totaled it. How is he not being held accountable for what he did?” In June, a family friend wrote a letter on their behalf to Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and to  . C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier and U. S. Attorney Channing Phillips. “The Van Goors’ case is a textbook example of what is wrong with how DC approaches crime, especially how DC approaches violent gun crime,” wrote the friend. Kristin received phone calls from Lanier and the Van Goors’ representative on the D. C. Council, Charles Allen (  6). On June 13, she met with Phillips and two assistants at the Paul bakery a few blocks from the courthouse. “I thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention,” wrote Phillips to Kristin in an email the following day.  “We always strive to do better and your comments were insightful and instructive. ” Kristin was encouraged. Another assistant U. S. attorney, Kacie Weston, soon got in touch with the Van Goors. She had been assigned to review the case. Kristin felt optimistic that prosecutors intended to charge Mayo with felony destruction of property. At the end of August, Weston called Kristin. Weston said her colleagues did not think they could charge Mayo for totaling the Van Goors’ car. Weston explained that Mayo’s signed admission in the plea deal about the car wreck essentially barred prosecutors from pursuing him on that charge. Kristin could not believe it. When she tried to respond, her voice started to crack. Her words failed her. She told the prosecutor she had to go. Choking back tears, she hung up the phone. "
"         In the tour for her new book “Settle For More,” Fox News host Megyn Kelly has spoken at length about a certain progression over her career. After claiming that she was sexually harassed in the   by Fox News chief Roger Ailes, Kelly reported the incidents to a supervisor and then put her head down. When the matter arose again this past summer after former host Gretchen Carlson sued Ailes for sexual harassment, Kelly spoke up forcefully in a review conducted by the prominent law firm Paul Weiss  —   a review that resulted in the ouster of Ailes. “I worked my tail off for the next ten years. I established myself as a serious person. I built my own power,” writes Kelly in “Settle for More. ” “And when the allegations about Roger hit, I used it. ” That same assertive Megyn Kelly last Wednesday answered questions from the Erik Wemple Blog about “Settle for More” and adjacent topics, including the apparent bidding war for her services. “I do feel fortunate to have some great options,” she told this blog, though she professed little confidence in the state of reporting on her next step. “I’ve been just dismayed to see these reports which are completely just based on speculation or based on, I don’t know, maybe some random unnamed network executive someplace who wants to see his alleged information in the paper. ” Her Fox News contract expires next year. Wherever Kelly lands, she wants to be home with her three children and husband, Doug Brunt, during the time she’s now gearing up for polemical showdowns on her 9 p. m. show, “The Kelly File. ” “I want to see my kids for dinner, I want to put them down at night, I want to see their soccer games after school,” she says. The interview covered a range of stuff, including Kelly’s “America’s Newsroom” collaboration with Fox News host Bill Hemmer; her mother, Linda; diversity on the staff of “The Kelly File”; Fox News and women’s legs; her support for new   host Tucker Carlson; her assessment of Fox News’s campaign coverage; and a lot more. The interview preceded news that Kelly’s executive producer, Tom Lowell, would be leaving his role for a promotion to Fox News VP and managing editor of news. One note before rolling out the transcription: Over the years this blog has published laudatory posts on Kelly as well as a number of sharply critical ones. TV news personalities, even when peddling books, don’t always enjoy sitting for a    session with a proven critic, but Kelly was    generous with her time and patient with our inquiries.      On Wednesday, Dec. 14, the Erik Wemple Blog conducted a phone interview with FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly. This is a part of their conversation. (Adriana   Washington Post)   Here’s the Q&A (with some edits for length and clarity): ERIK WEMPLE BLOG: How’s it feel to be in the midst of a big network bidding war, which is what I understand is going on? MEGYN KELLY: Listen, without confirming or denying the premise of your statement, I’ll say this: I do feel fortunate to have some great options. I feel humbled by the fact that there’s any interest in me at all, Erik. I don’t see myself as some television star, I see myself as a girl from Albany. So it’s a great business; it’s a dream job. And I’m very glad that I have chance to work here, whether it’s at Fox or another channel. Hard to get a job in TV news, so I haven’t lost sight of that. EWB: We’ve seen a lot of reports, one that there’s a bidding war, another that there isn’t. Any advice on where to put the hot and cold on those two? KELLY: No, I don’t want to weigh in on it. I’ve been dismayed to see these reports and so many from reporters who have no idea about the facts, you know? And I’ve just tried to hold my fire because it’s nobody’s business and it’s not appropriate for public discussion. You know? I mean, what happened in my case is my boss, Lachlan Murdoch, came to me with a generous offer and I was honest with him and said, “I need some time to think it over. ” It was long in advance of the date my contract expired and I just, you know, a lot has changed since I last signed with Fox and I needed to give it the thought and consideration it deserved and he was very kind about that and gave me permission to see what was out there so I could check out the landscape knowingly, as opposed to blindly. I could evaluate his offer, I should say, knowingly and not blindly. And now I’ve done that and now I’m going to take some time and give it the thought and consideration it deserves. But I’ve been just dismayed to see these reports which are completely just based on speculation or based on, I don’t know, maybe some random unnamed network executive someplace who wants to see his alleged information in the paper, but as I say, don’t believe a thing unless you hear from me directly because there’s a lot of bad info going on out there. EWB: You write that your heart aches when you get too deep into work stuff  —   and you note that your family is programmed to expect to see less of you during prime campaign season. Is there anything that you’re seeking in either your new contract at Fox News or in a contract at a competitor organization that would bring yet greater balance to your life? KELLY: Oh, my next deal is all about greater balance. I mean, that’s  —   I had professional success, right? Thankfully. And I feel like I’m at a level in my business where I’ve established myself as a professional. And the one thing I haven’t managed to do is find a way to achieve a better balance. You know, it started off fine, this particular job and my family situation because my three little ones were very small when I started “The Kelly File. ” They were 3, 2 and newborn. So, you know, I don’t know if you have kids, but you spend the day at home with them. EWB: I have a 10 and I have a 13. KELLY: Yeah, so you know how that goes. You can see them all day. But then they start school and now two out of my three and soon three out of my three are going to be in school from 8 a. m. in the morning till 3:30 p. m. So that’s not good enough, that’s when I leave for Fox. And I need to do better. EWB: You write in the book that you get to go to daytime school events. It seems as though, you know, you left the legal profession, you became famous, you make a lot of money and you get to go to your kids’ daytime school events: How is that not a    and what more would you be seeking on the balance front? KELLY: Yeah, well it is a win but it isn’t good enough. I want to see my kids for dinner, I want to put them down at night, I want to see their soccer games after school. I want to get to know the parents who take their kids to some of these events, and not all the time. We all feel that to some extent, but my problem in my current role is I see them in the morning and . . . I take them to school but unless there’s a school event that I can attend, I might not see them at all for the rest of the day until they’re sleeping in their beds at night. EWB: Do they call you at work while you’re trying to get ready for “The Kelly File”? KELLY: Yeah, we talk on the phone, so listen: It’s not that I don’t understand working parents make sacrifices; they all do, whether they’re TV anchors or not. It’s just a question of what works for any given individual and all I’m saying and I’ve said it publicly is that this particular balance that I’ve struck right now is not good enough for me. I will tell you that Fox has always been good about working things like that out. And I don’t have any doubt that they’d be good to me on that front here too, so that’s one of the things we’ll figure out before I have to make up my mind. EWB: Sticking with the family theme, you talk in the book about how your mom  —   you never discussed [with her] really that much about the bullying you sustained around seventh grade. Did your mom learn new things about you through “Settle for More”? KELLY: She did; she was not happy with me when she saw the extent of that bullying. Every time I talk to her, she says, “Why didn’t you tell me, why didn’t you tell me? I would have given those girls what for. ” You know, she’s still a protector. But I tell her the truth, which is, I was ashamed. I was ashamed. I was taking it as a measure of myself; I thought it was saying something about me, as opposed to just something about the bullies. I just didn’t have the emotional maturity to understand that wasn’t the case. So anyway, my mom is sweet and she wants to give somebody what’s for to this day. So she learned a lot on that and she learned a lot about the   with Donald Trump from the book. I talked to my mom about it as it was going on  —   she was among the few people whose advice I did seek in handling that whole thing. But unless you lived in my apartment and were over the age of 40, you didn’t get the daily download. There was only one person who I shared everything with, and that was my husband. So my mom was, I think, pretty shocked to hear the extent of it. EWB: As much praise as your mother and late father and many other people get in the book, hard work gets a lot of praise, too. And your advice for women who hit the glass ceiling is to work harder and harder. And solid though that advice is, there are some structural impediments, as I noted in a blog post a few weeks back. There was a  . org study talking about how women don’t get a chance, don’t get mentorships  —   something that goes beyond their work ethic. Is this too simple or do you think it’s the best advice and the best solution at this point in time? KELLY: No, what you said is 100 percent true, and there’s no question that to some extent there are structural disadvantages built in, not just for women but for other minority groups who don’t hold power at the executive level either at the company or in the industry. My position is not just “Oh, okay, anyone can overcome those. ” It’s just as we work to get more women and people in minority groups at higher levels in positions of power, what are our options? And in my experience, as a person who’s been in the professional world for some 25 years now, my experience is that the best core solution, the best solution for us as we change the structure, is to power through with great work product. Because in my experience, the more you lecture those running the companies on how they need to give more breaks to women or other minority groups and be more   to their work products and perhaps question themselves on a double standard, the more some of those people shut down to your messaging. I’m not saying it’s right; I’m just saying you can very easily get labeled as someone who sees everything through a prism of race or gender or what have you. So we have to walk a fine line. It’s sad but it’s the truth. So in my own circumstances, and trust me when I tell you I’ve experienced plenty of sexism in the workplace, but I’ve nevertheless managed to make it to the top in two different industries, and so for me, what I’m saying to other women is, “This is how I did it. ” EWB: You mentioned in one of your interviews, and this is part of the book, too  —   overcoming adversity, that children these days are becoming pampered, wusses or whatever. Parents are sheltering them from hardship and you cited the bullying you yourself experienced. But at the same time, Dan Savage talks about how bullying can push people toward suicide, and bullying is particularly acute for teens these days. KELLY: 100 percent. EWB: Are you saying that bullying can sort of be a good experience, one that fortifies you, or are you saying that the crackdown is worse than the problem these days? KELLY: No, when I talk about Cupcake Nation on my show or in my book, it’s not about bullying at all, and in fact in the book you’ll see I argue that especially when it comes to young people, I believe an adult must intervene. You really have to. Kids just don’t have the emotional maturity to deal with it and it can be extremely damaging; it can be  . So I see that as a special thing that people need to be very careful in how they handle bullying. . . . [At a Midwest university] they were literally telling the college students to call campus police if someone offended them. If somebody offended them! Now that’s taking it too far. Somebody saying something offensive to you, or insulting to you, is not pleasant, but it’s part of life. And my belief is we need to shore ourselves up, and our kids up and our younger generation up to understand how to deal with that unpleasant reality, because we won’t always be there to protect them. And you know, I for one want my own kids to know how to handle that. I see it as this: I send my kids to school not only to learn how to read and write and do math, but also to develop socially. So if there’s a negative interaction between my child and another child, what I want to know is, how was it handled, what lessons came out of it and of course, is my child okay? And then I’ll talk to them after the fact, but Doug [Brunt] and I talk about this all the time. Those situations are not all bad because it’s an experience our kid had to navigate and now hopefully can fold into the memory bank so he or she has the skills the next time it happens. But if we jump in and try to protect them from it, it doesn’t build anything for them. It is an important distinction; I never say this about bullying, which I know firsthand can leave scars that do not heal. EWB: One of the things you talk about in the book: In [media] interview after interview, you had to sort of credit Roger Ailes, but in the book you give a big nod to Bill Hemmer, who is also one of my favorite people on cable news. The takeaway I get is that as much as you appreciated Roger  —   he gave you those two maternity leaves, promotions during them, and I understand the full complexity that you mention with respect to Ailes. But here’s a guy Bill Hemmer  —   you tell the story in the book about how he sort of mentored you on how to handle breaking news alerts during your show as opposed to just handling more stable stories. How important was he and what exactly did he mean to you in terms of your ascension at Fox News? KELLY: He had a huge role in my development because we were not only partners; we were in some respects mentor and mentee, me being the mentee. By the time I left that show, we had become more of a partnership. But when I started, I was as green as they come. I had never anchored a show before, other than to sit in a couple of times here and there on some substitute anchoring. But I’d never been a TV anchor before; I’d never been employed as a TV anchor. So, I mean, Hemmer is the ultimate gentleman. I have never seen him have anything but a kind word and a generous lens for people. If he gets frustrated or angry or upset, I have never seen it, and I have spent a lot of time with the guy. EWB: So his whole persona   is not an act. KELLY: Absolutely not. And I’ve seen him  —   on TV news, as you know, it can be stressful. Breaking news comes, throw out the rundown, it’s rolling thunder; things are firing at you; the rundown’s gone or the guest is gone or it’s dark air; you don’t know what’s happening. Bill used to call it “boot camp TV” what we were doing on “America’s Newsroom” and he was right. But, man, he’s unflappable. Sometimes that’s when you see [people’s] dark side, when the stress hits and they start yelling at people and they’re nasty. NEVER. I’ll give you an example, just of Bill Hemmer which sums up his personality. It was at my engagement party to Doug. Hemmer was there. Doug’s parents were there; they were 70 and 80, thereabouts. . . . They needed to leave. [Confusion arises over how they would get a ride] Hemmer steps in and he’s like, “I will get them a taxi. ” So he takes Dr. and Mrs. Brunt out to the sidewalk, he hails them a taxi, he gets them into the taxi, he gives the address to the taxi driver, then he tells the taxi driver what radio station to put on because he thinks Dr. and Mrs. Brunt would enjoy their   ride more with this music in the background. Doug’s dad has since passed away but his mother still lives for Bill Hemmer. EWB: I was interested to see the photographs in your book. And you have a photograph of your staff and it sprung a question for me: You do all kinds of aggressive coverage, including on race. That staffing picture looked pretty much white, although there could be a couple of minorities in there. Do you think that for as aggressive as you are on racial issues, that you could use more diversity on the staff? KELLY: Well, I don’t know about the first part of your question. That’s not the reason. The reason to have more racial diversity on any team is because it’s helpful to have different perspectives on any issue. And I also believe that. It’s easier said than done, unfortunately. At Fox we started  —   this is one of Roger’s good legacies, the Ailes Apprentice Program, and that’s been pretty good about getting more people of color into the TV news ranks. But we don’t have enough, that’s just a fact. We don’t. And we can do better at that, just like most of the news networks can. EWB: Do you have anyone who’s African American on the staff at this point? KELLY: Not at the moment. Don’t hold me to that, Erik, because I’m probably forgetting somebody. Definitely we have some crew who work with me who are African American but . . . to be perfectly honest with you, I have never asked. We . . . have a couple of   people . . . I don’t know if they identify as mixed race or African American, so I don’t want to guess. EWB: Obviously you know a lot about the whole New Black Panther issue, Philadelphia; you were famous for that. I didn’t see much mention in the book, but now, eight years later, a couple CNN   commentators cited that incident sort of in the context of Trump talking about a rigged election. Do you think that’s a fair reading of the New Black Panther issue, sort of as grist for justifying Trump’s claims of the possibility of a rigged election? KELLY: What do you mean, that guys like those New Black Panthers [inaudible] at the polls? EWB: I believe Kayleigh McEnany said something to the effect that Trump “doesn’t want a scenario where there’s New Black Panthers outside with guns, essentially like intimidating people from coming into the polls. ” KELLY: That was not a widespread incident as far as we knew. That was a couple of   who showed up causing a bunch of nonsense at one Philadelphia polling station. I wouldn’t say you could extrapolate that to a general concern, especially because I don’t believe we saw it again in 2012. I believe it was these two guys trying to make a point in 2008; their point was made and I assume they understood the ramifications of it after the Department of Justice got involved. EWB: Do you think that your pushing that incident is where people draw their memory from? KELLY: Come on, Erik, next question. EWB: No? I just wondered. I mean, you did scores of segments on it. KELLY: You should take those scores of segments numbers with a huge grain of salt because that was some tabulation done by Media Matters that included teases. Teases! EWB: This is an interesting part of who you are as sort of a public figure. At one point in your book, you address Trump’s allegation that, I made her who she is . . . And there was some commentary out there saying that this was a sexist thing on Trump’s part. You said you had a different reaction. I gotta say: If that’s not sexist, what is? A guy telling you that his abuse makes you more of a commodity . . . KELLY: No, I’m not saying it wasn’t sexist. I’m just saying my reaction to it wasn’t, “Oh, what a sexist thing to say. ” It was just, “how ironic. ” The first thing I thought was, he wants credit for making my career when he is trying to destroy it. And he wants credit for making my career, when look at our relative advantages in life. I did not get a   or   loan from my dad. I did not grow up with silver spoon in my mouth. In fact, I lost my dad at a young age and had to put myself through school. I didn’t have a lot of the advantages Donald Trump had but I had the most important ones you can get, which are loving parents who cared about me and helped me develop a sense of self. But it certainly wasn’t Donald Trump’s doing. EWB: Absolutely. KELLY: It wasn’t that I didn’t understand that that comment could be perceived as sexist. It’s just my own reaction was, “Wow, that’s ironic. ” EWB: “Settle For More” cycles through a lot of very interesting details about how your network dealt with the mercurial Trump throughout the presidential campaign. One thing I noted was that he continued to appear on the “O’Reilly Factor” and “Hannity” and “Fox & Friends” even as he was attacking you. Did you ever ask management to say, “Hey, no O’Reilly, no Hannity, no ‘Fox & Friends’ till you make a visit to ‘The Kelly File’?” Because this looked to me  —   speaking of sexism  —   like a sexist cabal among guys: Sean Hannity, Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly. They were getting all these Trump interviews and you, who, I believe, is a much better interviewer, a much more penetrating journalist, would have made more news. Did you ever say, “Hey, why don’t we show some leadership here and don’t let Trump decide where he’s gonna go; we decide as a news network where he’s going to go, and I should be in that queue”? KELLY: No, I didn’t. I didn’t feel it was my place to try to interfere with Trump’s appearances or other people’s shows. The only thing I didn’t want, was I didn’t want him attacking me on my own network. I thought that was a reasonable place for me to draw a line, personally. And I thought that what happens outside of “The Kelly File” is for someone else to deal with, not me. I understood the position that management was in and that my colleagues were in because he was the  . He was very upset with me; there was of course no way he was going to come on with me. But what were they going to do: Ban the presidential   from all of Fox News until he decided he’d sit with me? I wouldn’t have expected them to do that. I had my own battles to fight and I didn’t feel the need to take on additional ones like that one and I understood the position my company was in. EWB: You have an interesting little paragraph in the book where you say that you continued to report on Trump  —   you and your staff tried your best to go down the middle and I think you were successful in that. It’s a very difficult thing to be attacked and to still give credit and to be fair in a situation like that. But there’s a paragraph where you said that some critics said you were being too tough on Trump. You said [in the book] something to the effect that “we merely stood out by comparison. ” Period. So there’s an unfinished thought there, Ms. Kelly. By comparison to what? KELLY: Well, I think that in particular in the primary season, very few people were offering any critical Trump coverage, virtually anywhere. It was stunning to me because I thought  —   and I’m not going to condemn my brethren in the news media specifically. I don’t want to call anybody out specifically  —   but what I’m saying is, we would look across the landscape to see whether anybody was meaningfully challenging him and we’d be a long time lookin’. For the reason I write in the book, because people were either entertained by him, didn’t perceive him as a serious candidate or were just enjoying the ratings that Trump brought. And in particular, some of these folks who put on his campaign rallies, Erik. His campaign rallies, not a policy speech, just rallies. Which we never would have done to Scott Walker or Hillary Clinton. Ever. And to me that seemed unfair to the other candidates and wrongheaded journalistically. EWB: That analysis applies to colleagues at your own network, correct? KELLY: Well, listen, Fox was not without sin in that department either. I can say that on “The Kelly File,” we did not do that. And listen, it was not the easiest thing to do because Trump rates. You pop up that campaign rally, you could let it roll for an hour and your ratings would shoot through the roof. Easy, done. Huge number. [inaudible] your average for the month. EWB: While we’re talking about the other cable networks, I thought that [Jake] Tapper and Chris Cuomo and a couple of other people on CNN did a good job of pushing Trump from the very beginning. I’m not saying that they necessarily had enough shots at him as O’Reilly and Hannity did. Gawker. com was merciless on you, called you a horrible person, facilitator of racism so on and so forth. In August, a chain of events that started with a privacy suit closed the site. You’re big on legal stuff  —   how do you process all of this? Was there any schadenfreude within Megyn Kelly about the death of Gawker. com? KELLY: I honestly can tell you that just hearing you say that about Gawker is the first I’ve heard about their attacks on me. I know what happened with them and Hulk Hogan, but that’s the first I’ve heard about their attacks on me because I do tend to avoid that stuff like the plague because I do believe it is the plague. I studiously avoid the darkest places of the Internet. Sometimes you can’t avoid it because you’re doing a legitimate news search and something pops up, but I don’t breathe that stuff in because I think it’s a carcinogen. EWB: Jon Stewart, he’s gone now from “The Daily Show,” and the departure has translated into less heat, less withering scrutiny of Fox News and CNN and MSNBC, to a lesser extent. They never seemed to miss a single contradiction in cable news. . . . Is that a form of accountability that the industry misses and needs? KELLY: I write a lot about Jon Stewart in “Settle for More,” and I just sort of try to give an example of how I felt his attacks were often unfair. Because you can’t get into it; as a news person, you can’t spend all your time responding to a Comedy Central star. It’s not what we do. However, and I’ve said publicly before many times, I thought Stewart was hilarious, except when he was attacking me, so it’s one of those, There but for the grace of God. I do think that there’s absolutely a role for media critics and Stewart was special among them and did it in a way that was so intelligent and entertaining. I don’t know whether there will ever be another like him. And for whatever it’s worth, we actually have a good relationship. I write in the book we moved on, not friends exactly but not enemies either. I would say we’ve only become closer to friends since that date years ago. However, I think part of that discussion these days is driven by a belief on some level that Stewart could have brought Trump down or perhaps he could have shamed some of the media into doing a better job of covering him honestly. And I don’t think that’s true. I think if Stewart had been his full self during this whole election, we would have wound up with the exact same result. And that’s just the nature of the way our country is built. Stewart had so many fans, but I’d venture to say they weren’t in most of the counties that went red in this presidential election. They tend to be in this echo chamber where the people who love you listen and the people who don’t, don’t. EWB: The litigation of Andrea Tantaros  —   Fox News was shown to have has some pretty strict book guidelines, and one of them requires 10 percent of net profits after your advance is earned out  —   that goes to the network. Does your contract include that provision? And everyone always has a book going  —   O’Reilly on manners, of all things, and Japan and Reagan; Bret Baier on Ike; Ainsley Earhardt on, I forgot, something or other. KELLY: Children. EWB: Children, right. Does the flogging of the books detract from news at Fox News? And this is an industry, isn’t it  —   a  ? What’s your take on it? KELLY: I don’t know  —   almost every journalist has written a book. It’s not just Fox News. You know, Jake Tapper, Anderson Cooper, you name it. I understand why you’re asking the question, because sometimes I look around cable news and it’s like you wonder whether you’re looking at anchors or authors. What is your primary role? I would say for me, I can tell you that HarperCollins certainly would have liked me to have pushed the book a lot before it came to sale. They really wanted me to get out there and start promoting it and I just didn’t feel comfortable doing that. So I mentioned it a couple of times. But for me, I felt uncomfortable. I said, ‘Look, when it’s out, I’ll promote it. I’ll promote the hell out of it.’ I have an obligation to try to get out there and sell it. And now I’ve done that. I feel like I’ve met my obligation to them. But I do think that, yeah, it can go on for a really long time and if it interferes in your viewers’ willingness to consume your show, because it’s supposed to be a straight news product or it’s supposed to be a news product of some sort, then it can be distracting. EWB: On the timing . . . you told Anderson Cooper that you didn’t want to float the book before the election because you didn’t want to become the story. KELLY: Well, I was the story; I didn’t want to become any more the story. EWB: Well, that’s the point, I mean, I think that’s a very honest response. But you were going to be the story anyway: Why not do an Oct. 15 release date and give voters more information for a critical decision, than Nov. 15 and not give those voters that critical information? I still don’t understand. KELLY: You have to understand that this isn’t just “Megyn Kelly, journalist, stumbles upon a news story. ” This is “Megyn Kelly, human being, woman, mother, wife, finds herself in the middle of a news story in which her safety was in danger, her children’s safety was in danger,” and I have actual responsibilities to the people who live in my home to make sure I didn’t do anything to make our situation worse, and I took those very seriously. I did not want to do anything that would chum up those shark waters I was already swimming in. And while I thought it was important to make a historical record of what Donald Trump had done  —   just as a matter of First Amendment issues and presidential politics, whether he won or not I thought it was important  —   I didn’t feel it was necessary to endanger my own safety or my children’s safety to do that. And I also didn’t want people to feel that I was trying to sink Donald Trump in any way, that I was trying to gum up his chances by hitting him with all these details at any point prior to the election. And I don’t believe in any way, shape or form that anything in this book would have stopped Donald Trump or changed his ascension to this office, but I do think it was important for me to tell it. So I think you should stop hitting me for not releasing it earlier and start praising me for releasing it at all. EWB: That’s very articulate, but I don’t think we as journalists  —   this is just a sort of journalist ethics discussion  —   I don’t think we as journalists should even get into the business of trying to figure out whether this will derail someone or not. I just think the only test is whether it’s relevant. KELLY: Well, I didn’t think it was  …    I didn’t think it would have an impact on the election one way or the other. I didn’t  —   I understood how there could be an appearance of impropriety, if you will, by some people who thought, “Okay, you’re doing it. ” Listen, I could have said some things about Hillary Clinton that would have been unfortunate for her, too. But I don’t want to interfere. I didn’t want to be part of this election at all. And to go out there and say, “I was under death threat for the entire year. ” Listen, I’d said enough that people knew that. But I didn’t have to get into the specifics of my security guards and the number of death threats and the people showing up at my home. That just wasn’t necessary. I’d given the   items; that’s all people needed to know. And I made sure they knew it. EWB: I just think there’s power in the narrative that you put in the book, when you put it all together in your voice. It’s extremely powerful. KELLY: I know, Erik, but be realistic. I have a     and   . We lived under armed guard for a year. We still have an armed guard. Why would I do something that might fan those flames within a month of a presidential election? How do you think that would have gone for me and my family? EWB: But isn’t the risk just as great now? KELLY: No, because the election is over. And I knew it would be over one way or the other. Either Trump would have lost and his supporters would have said, “Whatever. ” Or Trump would have won, and his supporters would say, “All right, whatever. ” EWB: So you’re not seeing the plume of abuse that you did during the campaign? KELLY: Not the same, no. Absolutely not the same, no. EWB: You mention in the book, and this is an interesting part . . . you say that there were anchors who did this   sort of thing with Trump [wherein they rehearse questions for an interview in advance of the interview]. But you don’t name them; who are they? KELLY: Obviously I’m not going to name them now because I chose not to do so in my book. EWB: I understand that you don’t want to name them, but you put it out there. I might just all of a sudden decide that that’s Anderson Cooper or that’s  —   take a name  —   Chris Hayes. Isn’t this the problem with anonymous sources that when you make such an allegation and don’t give any specificity, it just slimes the whole industry? KELLY: I don’t think so. I think people are smart enough to figure out who the likely candidates are. And in any event, this is not a nightly news report on “The Kelly File. ” It’s a book, I mean there’s a lot in there that  —   it’s not something I would report at night on Fox News, but it’s my take on a situation. And I think, again, this is something that people should know took place and you don’t need the names to know that there was corruption in the coverage of this race. That was deeply problematic. EWB: But everybody’s corrupt now. KELLY: I think any reasonable person knows which reporters to eliminate. EWB: I just think everybody is now slimed and that’s a problem with the media  —   that criticism takes place with such a broad brush that everybody gets the taint. KELLY: I don’t think that’s true. I don’t think that’s true at all. Look at Donald Trump: He loves to call out individual reporters by name, which leads to major problems in those reporters’ lives. I certainly don’t want to add to that myself. EWB: In the book, you write that Fox News critics were delighting in Roger Ailes’s downfall. And you said, “Perhaps it was the Fox News connection, but questions surfaced a little too frequently, asking why these women didn’t just quit. Why it took them so long to come forward,” you wrote. But that wasn’t just Fox News critics. [Fox News stalwart] Brit Hume also tweeted that same sentiment, and he is cited in the book as a great mentor. Isn’t that a reaction of just, like, guys? KELLY: Not all guys. EWB: Do you need to brush back Brit Hume as well? KELLY: I’m not going to make any comment about anything specific about Brit or what anybody else at my company said. But I do think that that   reaction is outdated and shortsighted. EWB: Yeah, I made the point at the time. I thought it was awful. KELLY: I know, and it was a great point. The   reaction to put the blame on the women is wrong, it’s wrong. We have to start talking honestly about this or it’s going to continue. As I’ve said in many interviews, you don’t get to ask me why I didn’t come forward sooner until you ask me whether there was a safe avenue for reporting at my company. Only if the answer to that question is “yes” do you get to ask me why I didn’t come forward. And I say that not for myself, Erik, because I did come forward. I say that for my fellow women at Fox News, who did not. And it’s not because they’re bad people or they enjoyed it or they asked for it or it was no big deal. It’s because in many cases they were scared  —   they were scared of what would happen to them. It’s very easy for some men and in some cases women to sit back and say with   hindsight, “  should have done more. ” But it doesn’t account for the reality. And by the way, that’s another reason why when people say now, “Would you advise young women now to come forward?” I have to stop and say, “Let’s be careful about this. ” Because as much as I, Megyn Kelly, with my contract and generous salary and my life all set could look back and start lecturing    women on how they must take a stand, it would be disingenuous. Because if there’s a    woman or a    woman who is in the position I was in at that time, it would be career suicide for her to do more. EWB: You mention that you were able to use the power that you’d stockpiled to speak out last summer, and I think that’s 100 percent true. Just a question, have you used any of that authority in the aftermath of Ailes’s departure to take aim at some of his legacies on air, like the   leg cam and the showcasing of women’s legs on air? There are other things that sort of outlast Roger Ailes. Are you using some of that credibility to take on those things, or have you done your part and you’re just focusing on “The Kelly File”? KELLY: I would say “assumes facts not in evidence. ” I’ve been there 12 years; I’ve never had a leg cam. Never. People are so focused on the appearances of Fox News anchors. Look across the networks. The Fox News anchors are lovely. They have an incredible combination of brains and beauty. And I think that’s one of the reasons people love watching them and listening to them. But we haven’t cornered the market on it. When I look at CNN, I see incredible combinations of brains and beauty there, too. And I have actually seen women’s legs and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, I don’t think that needs to be corrected. I think you can look at a woman’s legs while she delivers the news and still take her seriously . . . I believe I’m living proof of that. EWB: You see more women legs than men legs, right? I mean, I don’t know what Bill O’Reilly’s legs look like. KELLY: Welcome to humanity, Erik. That’s not a Fox News thing; that’s a human being thing.      On Wednesday, Dec. 14, the Erik Wemple Blog conducted a phone interview with FOX News anchor Megyn Kelly. This is a part of their conversation. (Adriana   Washington Post)   EWB: Tucker Carlson once asked on the set of “Fox & Friends”: “Are female breadwinners a recipe for disharmony within the home?” Now, the departure of Ailes was an inflection point for Fox News, meaning that there was perhaps a chance to take the programming in a different direction. Among the first major moves was to place this guy Carlson in the [ ] lineup. Did you lobby for him; if not, for whom did you? And to what extent does he represent a future that you’d like to see for Fox News? KELLY: As far as that particular comment, I refer you to my segment with Lou Dobbs and Erick Erickson. In which I famously challenged two guys at my network for saying exactly that kind of thing, so you know how I feel about comments like that. As far as Tucker, though, I don’t think you can sum up the man based on a comment here, a comment there. My experience with him has been nothing but delightful and respectful and I think he’s a huge talent and I am thrilled to see him hosting the 7 p. m. show  —   thrilled. EWB: Have you seen any of the misogyny that he did at the Daily Caller, including the website with all the titty clickbait and all that stuff? Does that matter to you? KELLY: I don’t  —   no, I haven’t see that and I don’t know what you’re referring to. It’s not like Tucker is at my house every night for dinner, but I have known him for a long time and what I’ve seen of him is a man who’s respectful and kind and loving and actually so far in his time at 7 p. m. I happen to know has reached out to a lot of women who may not get on camera that often to say, “Would you like a shot, would you like to come on? I think you’re great. ” All I’ve heard from my female colleagues is gratitude for new opportunities since he’s taken over that show. So I am a big Tucker fan and I believe he’s a good person and will continue to believe that until somebody gives me great reason to believe otherwise."
"      “Arnold and Tim, if you’d come up, we’re going to give you a nice, beautiful check,” Donald Trump said. He held up an oversize check, the kind they give to people who win golf tournaments. It was for $100, 000. In the   corner the check said: “The Donald J. Trump Foundation. ” Along the bottom, it had the slogan of Trump’s presidential campaign: “Make America Great Again. ” This was in February. The beginning of it. Trump was in Waterloo, Iowa, for a   rally at the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center  —   named for five local siblings who had been assigned to the same Navy cruiser in World War II. They all died when the ship went down at Guadalcanal. Trump had stopped his rally to do something presidential candidates don’t normally do. He was giving away money. Arnold and Tim, whom he had called to the stage, were from a local veterans group. Although their big check had Trump’s name on it, it wasn’t actually Trump’s money. Instead, the cash had been raised from other donors a few days earlier, at a televised fundraiser that Trump had held while he skipped a GOP debate because of a feud with Fox News. Trump said he had raised $6 million that night, including a $1 million gift from his own pocket. Now Trump was giving it, a little at a time, to charities in the towns where he held campaign events. “See you in the White House,” one of the men said to Trump, leaving the stage with this check that married a nonprofit’s name and a campaign’s slogan. “He said, ‘We’ll see you in the White House,’ ” Trump repeated to the crowd. “That’s nice. ” After that, Trump lost Iowa. He won New Hampshire. Then he stopped giving away money.  But as far as I could tell, just over $1. 1 million had been given away. Far less than what Trump said he raised. And there was no sign of the $1 million Trump had promised from his own pocket.  So what happened to the rest of the money? It sounded like an easy question that the Trump campaign could answer quickly. I thought I’d be through with the story in a day or two. I was wrong.  That was the start of nine months of work for me, trying to dig up the truth about a part of Trump’s life that he wanted to keep secret. I didn’t understand  —   and I don’t think Trump understood, either  —   where that one check, and that one question, would lead.    I’ve been a reporter for The Washington Post since 2000, covering everything from homicide scenes in the District to Congress to the World Championship Muskrat Skinning Contest. (People race to see who skins a dead muskrat the fastest. There’s also a beauty pageant. Some women compete in both.) By the time I got to that Trump event in Waterloo, I’d been covering the 2016 presidential election for 13 months, since the last weeks of 2014. But I had the track record of a mummy’s curse: Just about every campaign I had touched was dead. I had, for instance, covered former New York governor George Pataki’s (failed) attempt to get people to recognize him in a New Hampshire Chipotle. Pataki dropped out. I read the collected works of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and made a list of everything the old Baptist preacher had ever condemned as immoral or untoward. The subjects of his condemnation ranged from   women going braless to dogs wearing clothes to Beyoncé. Huckabee condemned me. Then he dropped out, too. I went to St. Louis to write about a speech given by former Texas governor Rick Perry. In the middle of the speech, Perry dropped out.  So by the time the New Hampshire primaries were over, the candidates I had covered were kaput. I needed a new beat. While I pondered what that would be, I decided to do a short story about the money Trump had raised for veterans.  I wanted to chase down two suspicions I’d brought home with me from that event in Iowa. For one thing, I thought Trump might have broken the law by improperly mixing his foundation with his presidential campaign. I started calling experts. “I think it’s pretty clear that that’s over the line,” Marc S. Owens, the former longtime head of the Internal Revenue Service’s nonprofit division, told me when I called him. Then Owens kept talking, and the story started deflating. In theory, Owens said, nonprofit groups like the Trump Foundation are “absolutely prohibited” from participating or intervening in a political campaign. But, he said, if the IRS did investigate, it wouldn’t likely start until the Trump Foundation filed its paperwork for 2016. Which wouldn’t be until late 2017. Then an agent would open a case. There went 2018. Finally, Owens said, the IRS might take action: It might even take away the Trump Foundation’s   status. In 2019. Or maybe not ever. Owens doubted that the IRS  —   already under scrutiny from the   Congress after allegations it had given undue scrutiny to conservative groups  —   would ever pick a fight with Trump. “I don’t think anything’s going to happen” to Trump, Owens said. “But, theoretically, it could. ” My other suspicion was that Trump was still sitting on the bulk of the money he had raised for veterans  —   including the $1 million he had promised from himself. I asked Trump’s people to account for all this money. They didn’t. Then, finally, I got a call. “The money is fully spent,” Corey Lewandowski, then Trump’s campaign manager, told me in late May. “Mr. Trump’s money is fully spent. ” But, Lewandowski told me, the details of Trump’s $1 million in gifts were secret. He wouldn’t say which groups Trump had donated to. Or when. Or in what amounts. This was an important assertion  —   that Trump had delivered on a signature campaign promise  —   made without proof. I didn’t want to just take Lewandowksi’s word for it. So I tried to prove him right. I spent a day searching for Trump’s money on Twitter, asking vets’ organizations if they’d gotten any of it. I used Trump’s Twitter handle, @realdonaldtrump, because I wanted Trump to see me searching. Trump saw. The next night, he called me to say he had just then given away the $1 million, all in one swoop, to a nonprofit run by a friend. That meant when Lewandowski said Trump’s money was “fully spent,” it was actually still in Trump’s pocket. On the phone, I asked Trump: Would you really have given this money away if I hadn’t been asking about it?   “You know, you’re a nasty guy,” he said. “You’re really a nasty guy. ”      (McKenna   Washington Post)   A few days later, Trump held a news conference in Trump Tower, where he answered my other question. Where was the remainder of the money Trump had raised from other donors, four months earlier? Turns out, it had been sitting in the Trump Foundation, unspent. In this news conference, Trump announced that he had given the last of it away  —   and he lashed out at the media for asking him to account for the money.  “Instead of being like, ‘Thank you very much, Mr. Trump,’ or ‘Trump did a good job,’ everyone said : ‘Who got it? Who got it? Who got it?’ And you make me look very bad,” Trump said. “I have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job. ” Because my stories had led to this angry moment, I was on “Morning Joe” and CNN and Lawrence O’Donnell. The New York Times and Le Monde referenced my work. My dad wrote to say how proud he was of me. I read pundits predicting that the presidential race itself would change. They said the old trope about Trump  —   that he was a Teflon candidate, immune to accountability  —   was now disproved.  When I came home from my last TV hit, the kids, ages 4 and 5 months, were asleep. The house was quiet. I was still full of caffeine and   energy and decided to tidy up. Among the clutter on the coffee table, I found my   ’s Party Popper, a bright yellow gun that fired confetti. For some reason, I held the gun up to my eye and looked down the barrel, the way Yosemite Sam always does.  It looked unloaded. Then, for some reason, I pulled the trigger. When I got to the ER, I had a swollen face,   confetti in my hair and a faint odor of gun smoke. Finally, the doctor could see me. “I shot myself in the eye with a glitter gun,” I said. I showed him the Party Popper, which I had brought with me, in case he wanted to send it off to the National Institute of Morons for further study.    I got home from the hospital with a scratched cornea and a tube of eye ointment. The next day, with some of my dignity permanently lost, I got started on a bigger story. The idea for this story had come from our executive editor, Marty Baron. One night, as we both waited for an elevator, Marty offered a suggestion. Why don’t you go beyond Trump’s promises to give to veterans, he said, and look at Trump’s giving to charity, period? The logic was that Trump had just tried to wiggle out of a charitable promise he’d made on national TV. What, Marty wondered, had he been doing before the campaign, when nobody was looking? That reporting process started with a lot of paper. Working with one of The Post’s ace researchers, Alice Crites, I went digging for records that would reveal Trump’s charitable giving, going back to his early days as a Manhattan developer in the 1980s. We looked at old news clippings, detailing Trump’s public statements. And we looked at tax filings from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which had been dug out of storage by New York state. Those two sources told two very different stories. In the news clippings, you could see that Trump had repeatedly made public promises to donate to charity. In the 1980s, for instance, Trump had promised to give away $4 million from sales of his book “The Art of the Deal. ” In more recent years, he said he would give away $2. 5 million he made off “The Apprentice. ” And donated the profits from Trump University. All told, the pledges in those news clips made it seem that Trump had given away more than $12 million. In more recent clippings, in fact, Trump’s presidential campaign staff said his actual giving had been far higher than that: “tens of millions ” over his lifetime. The state’s records showed something else. They showed that the Trump Foundation  —   which Trump had set up to give away his own money  —   had received only a total of $5. 5 million from Trump since 1987.  So where was all that other money that he said he had been donating? “We want to keep them private. We want to keep them quiet,” Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of Trump’s business, had told me about the missing money. “He doesn’t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. ” Once again, I didn’t want to take his word for it. So I set out  —   using Twitter  —   to try to prove Trump right. I started making a list of charities I thought were most likely to have received money from Trump’s own pocket. Nonprofits that had received donations from the Trump Foundation. Charities whose galas Trump had attended. Causes he’d praised on Twitter. In each case, I called the charity and asked if it had ever received a donation from Trump  —   and, if so, when. Then, I wrote the charity’s name and its response on a legal pad and posted pictures of the legal pad to Twitter. My list started to grow: 100 charities. 150. 200. In all those calls, a pattern began to emerge. In the years between 2008 and 2015  —   when Trump wasn’t giving money to the Trump Foundation  —   he didn’t seem to have given much to other people’s charities, either. The only gift I could find in that range was from 2009, when he was credited with giving less than $10, 000 to the Police Athletic League of New York City.      250 charities. As the circus of the 2016 campaign swirled around me  —   Twitter beefs, Trump’s criticisms of a Gold Star family and a Mexican American federal judge  —   I stayed focused on this small slice of Trump’s life. After a while, my    daughter started talking about the Trump Foundation at dinner, just because her parents talked about nothing else. “He should give the money to the people, so the people get the money,” she said. “It’s not nice. ”  I called 300 charities.  325. This story started to remind me of one of the weirdest stories I’ve ever done: a 2014 tale about the federal government’s giant paperwork cave. The cave was about 45 minutes north of Pittsburgh. The Office of Personnel Management kept federal employees’ personnel records in 28, 000 file cabinets inside the caverns of an abandoned limestone mine. There were 600 federal employees down there. Cave clerks. Their job was to assemble and collate paperwork from the caverns and use that paperwork to compute how much individual federal employees would receive in benefits when they retired. The cave clerks worked in an absurdist parody of government inefficiency, which was as slow in 2014 as it was in the 1970s.  In reporting jargon, I’d tried the front door: I asked to tour the mine. OPM said no. So then I went looking for windows. I sought out   who had firsthand knowledge of the place but weren’t beholden to OPM’s desire for secrecy. I found them. By piecing together their recollections, I got the story that the government didn’t want me to find.  Now Trump himself was the abandoned limestone mine.  If he wouldn’t tell me what he had given away, I’d try to find the answer anyway  —   by talking to charities with firsthand knowledge of what he had given. When I reached No. 325 on my list, I yanked on a window, and it gave.      (Peter Stevenson, Lee   Washington Post)   “They ended up purchasing a Michael Israel portrait of Donald Trump,” said Matthew Ladika, the CEO of a Florida children’s charity called HomeSafe. I had called this charity  —   which I knew had received $20, 000 from the Trump Foundation  —   to ask if it had ever received anything else, from Trump’s own pocket. It had not. But Ladika told me something I didn’t expect: the reason for that $20, 000 gift from Trump’s charity. Trump had used it to buy a portrait of himself. The portrait had been painted by a “speed painter,” who was the entertainment at a charity gala at Trump’s    Club. Melania Trump bought it for $20, 000. But then, later, Trump paid for it with a check from the Trump Foundation. That raised a new set of questions. Tax law prohibits “” which is when charity leaders use their nonprofits’ money to buy things for themselves. If Trump hung that portrait on the wall at one of his resorts, for instance, he’d be breaking the law. So where was the portrait now? I asked Trump’s people. They didn’t respond.  I tried a Google Images search, feeding it a photo of the portrait, which showed Trump’s painted face. “Best guess for this image: Orange,” Google said. I got a screen full of oranges. Orange juice. Orange Julius. No portraits. I kept looking, posting details of my search to Twitter. Soon I had attracted a virtual army, ready to join the scavenger hunt. I had begun the year with 4, 700 Twitter followers. By September I had more than 60, 000 and climbing fast. I began hearing from celebrities and even a few personal heroes, offering their assistance out of the blue. The barbecue columnist for Texas Monthly  —   an idol to me, as a journalist and a native Texan  —   was watching videos of other people’s parties taken at a Trump golf resort. He thought he’d spotted the painting in the background (he hadn’t). Kathy Griffin, the actress, called me with her memories about visiting the set of Trump’s “The Celebrity Apprentice. ” Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner, was sending me links on Twitter, new leads on Trump promises. That army  —   almost all of them strangers to me  —   never found the first portrait. But soon there was a new target and a new scavenger hunt.  “Google ‘Havi Art Trump,’ ” said a strange voice on the phone one day, calling from the 561 area code. Palm Beach, Fla. I did. The Google search revealed a new portrait of Trump. This one was four feet tall, painted by Miami artist Havi Schanz. After a phone call, I confirmed that Trump had purchased it in 2014 at a charity auction run by the Unicorn Children’s Foundation. Once again, he had the Trump Foundation pay the bill. I needed to find that portrait. I turned to my Twitter followers, putting out a photo of the new $10, 000 portrait. That was at 10:34 a. m.      By early evening I knew where it was. “The Havi Painting was at Doral National in Miami, you can see two separate pics that tourists have taken of it,” wrote Allison Aguilar. I’ve never met Aguilar. I learned later that she is a former HR manager who is now a    mother in Atlanta, writing short stories on the side. Days before, looking for the $20, 000 portrait, she had scoured the website for Trump’s golf resort at Doral, in Florida, scanning more than 500   photos of the resort’s rooms, restaurants and golf course. About halfway through, she had spotted another portrait in a photo, hanging on a wall at the resort.  Then she saw my tweet, saying that I was now looking for that portrait, too. “Oh, now that I’ve seen,” Aguilar remembered thinking. The TripAdvisor photo she found was dated February 2016.  Was the portrait still there? The answer was provided by another stranger.  Enrique Acevedo, an anchor at the   network Univision, saw my tweet that night, broadcasting that Aguilar had traced the portrait to Doral. Acevedo realized that Doral was just a few blocks from the Univision studios. He booked a room for that night. “I used points,” Acevedo said. “I didn’t want to . .. spend any money on Trump’s property, so I used points. ” After his newscast ended, Acevedo checked in and started quizzing the   cleaning crews. “Have you seen this picture?” he asked. “They said, ‘Oh yeah, it’s downstairs.’ ” Bingo. Acevedo found the $10, 000 portrait, paid for with charity money, hanging on the wall of the resort’s sports bar. “Hey @Fahrenthold just checked and the portrait is still hanging at the Champions Lounge. How much did you say it cost the Trump Foundation?” he wrote on Twitter that night.     All of that  —   from my first request for help to Acevedo’s discovery  —   had taken less than 14 hours. Together, we had discovered Trump doing exactly what the law said he couldn’t do: using his charity’s money to decorate his resort. A Trump spokesman later offered the explanation that the resort was actually doing the foundation a favor, by storing its art free of charge. Tax experts were not impressed by this reasoning. “It’s hard to make an IRS auditor laugh,” one told me. “But this would do it. ”      On a morning in October, a month before Election Day, a window opened itself.  I got a phone call. It was a source, with a video.  The first few seconds were jumpy footage of a bus, lumbering through a bland Hollywood backlot. The soundtrack was indistinct mumbling. But then there was Trump’s voice. “I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down in Palm Beach. I moved on her. And I failed. I’ll admit it,” he was saying. “I did try and     her. She was married. ” That was 17 seconds in. On the bus were Trump and “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. The video, I figured out, had been shot in 2005. The two men were visiting the set of NBC’s “Days of Our Lives,” where Trump was to make a cameo appearance. In a blaze of network synergy, NBC’s “Access Hollywood” was there to see Trump arrive. Trump and Bush were wearing hot microphones. On the bus, Trump told Bush about trying and failing to seduce a woman in Palm Beach. (“I took her out furniture shopping,” he said.)  Trump also described how he kissed and groped women, without asking first.  “And when you’re a star, they let you do it!” Trump said. The thing that stood out to me was the genuine wonder in his voice. He seemed to be saying: I can’t believe it either, but the world lets you get away with this. This was not the first time Trump had been recorded having lewd conversations. BuzzFeed, in particular, had found tapes of Trump talking about women with shock jock Howard Stern. (“You could’ve gotten her, right? You could’ve nailed her,” Stern asked him once about Princess Diana, who at the time had recently died. “I think I could have,” Trump said.) But those had been excused, by some, because they were just words. Trump, it seemed, was playing an outrageous version of himself in public, for the entertainment of Stern and his audience.  But this video was different. This was Trump talking, in private, about his own conduct: how, when and why he groped women. It was not a story about words. It was about Trump’s actions, which these words revealed for the first time. I first made myself into Paul Revere of the cubicles, raising alarms around the newsroom and setting people in motion. The Post’s video team started to edit, transcribe and subtitle the footage. They told me they would be ready to post a version of the video at about 3:30 p. m. That was my deadline. I called NBC to see if they thought the video was a hoax. I reached out to a spokeswoman for Billy Bush and a publicist for Arianne Zucker, the   actress in the video who escorted Trump and Bush around the studio. And I reached out to Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. I sent her the transcript of the video. I asked:  “1. )Does Mr. Trump have any reason to believe that it is not authentic, and that he did not say these things? 2. )Does Mr. Trump recall that conversation? If so, does he believe there is anything that was *not* captured in this transcript that would make him look better? 3. )Does Mr. Trump have any regrets about this conversation?” Nobody answered right away.  In the meantime, I had to start writing. The story was easy to compose, since much of it was simply repeating what Trump had said. The only problem was the bad words.  The Post is a fairly fusty place when it comes to profanity. If a reporter tries to get a bad word into a story, the word is usually forwarded to top editors, who consider it with the gravity and speed that the Vatican applies to candidates for sainthood. That unwieldy system assumed that bad words would attack one at a time, like bad guys in a   movie. But in this story, we were dealing with a whole army of bad words at once. The system was overloaded. When Trump said, “Grab ’em by the    ” for instance, the editors weren’t sure people would be able to guess right away what “    ” was. They added a letter at the end: “   . ”  Other words required a ruling from the bosses. “Go find out about ‘tits’!” I heard one editor tell another, while the story was being edited  —   Trump had used the word in criticizing a woman’s appearance. The second editor left to find a   editor who could make a ruling. “ ‘Tits’ is all right,” he said when he returned.  At this point, 3:30 p. m. was getting closer. We didn’t get any    response from NBC, Bush or Zucker.  Then we heard from Trump’s spokeswoman.  She’d read the transcript. She said: That doesn’t sound like Mr. Trump. She wanted to see the video. We sent it to them at 3:50 p. m. with a warning that we would publish the story soon  —   with or without their comment. Then nothing. Our lawyers and editors were satisfied that the tape was legitimate and newsworthy. The story was edited and ready to go. 4 p. m. arrived. Terri Rupar, the national digital editor, was walking to her desk to hit the button and publish it without comment from Trump.  I yelled for Terri to stop.  Trump was admitting it.  “This was locker room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  —   not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended,” he said in a statement that arrived at that moment.  The story published at 4:02 p. m. It became the   story of all time on The Post’s website, easily surpassing the past champion, a tale about a woman from Burundi who was believed dead but returned to crash her own funeral. At one point, more than 100, 000 people were simultaneously reading the story about the video. The servers that measure The Post’s Web traffic actually broke because there was too much traffic.  Afterward, Trump’s deficit in polling averages increased, from a little over 3 points to more than 5 points. Prominent Republicans turned to denounce him. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( .) said he was “sickened. ”  Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was whisked out of a campaign event  —   viewing a collection of autographed cardboard   buns in Toledo  —   without comment.  Trump himself made a second, more thorough apology in a   Facebook video later that evening. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize,” he said.   I had to buy another suit, for TV appearances. My daughter, now fully over the idea that her father was on TV, began complaining when I came on and she had to switch off “Peppa Pig. ” I had to quit doing the cooking at home. (Nobody complained about that.)  On Twitter I watched myself become a minor celebrity  —   all because of a story that had, essentially, fallen into my lap. “My wife says that David @Fahrenthold is a time traveler from the future trying to carefully fix the darkest timeline. I believe her,” wrote James Church  a professor at Austin Peay State University. And, after I appeared on Fox News Channel to talk about the story, I heard from a man in Milwaukee. He called The Post but couldn’t say “Fahrenthold” in a way that the   system recognized. He wound up in the   box of another reporter in Sports. “I wanna kill him,” the caller said of me. “Thank you. ” The Post took this seriously. I met with the D. C. police and the FBI, and a security consultant the paper hired. She was a congenial woman, a former counterterrorism official. When she arrived at our house she terrified us far more than the actual death threat had.  “Your cars are parked too far away for a car bomb,” she said, looking out the front windows at the street. “They’ll probably cut your brake lines. ” She recommended having a car patrol the neighborhood. She recommended a safe room.  She recommended stocking the safe room with provisions, in case we were under siege so long that we needed snacks.  I had to get back to work. My wife  —   who hadn’t complained about any of this, the long hours or the missed bedtimes or the   TV appearances  —   stopped me, shaken at what I’d gotten us into.  When the leaked Trump video still seemed to have swung the 2016 campaign, I was interviewed by a German reporter, who asked, “Do you have the feeling . .. ‘This is it, this is the peak of my career?’ ”    The point of my stories was not to defeat Trump. The point was to tell readers the facts about this man running for president. How reliable was he at keeping promises? How much moral responsibility did he feel to help those less fortunate than he? By the end of the election, I felt I’d done my job. My last big story about Trump started with an amazing anecdote, which came from a tip from a reader. In 1996, Trump had crashed a   ceremony for a charity opening a nursery school for children with AIDS. Trump, who had never donated to the charity, stole a seat onstage that had been saved for a big contributor.  He sat there through the whole ceremony, singing along with the choir of children as cameras snapped, and then left without giving a dime. “All of this is completely consistent with who Trump is,” Tony Schwartz, Trump’s   on his 1987 book “The Art of the Deal,” told me. “He’s a man who operates inside a tiny bubble that never extends beyond what he believes is his  . ”  “If your worldview is only you  —   if all you’re seeing is a mirror  —   then there’s nobody to give money to,” Schwartz said. “Except yourself. ”    Election Day came. I thought my time with Trump had come to an end.  That night, my job was to   the main Web story about the election. My colleague Matea Gold and I were supposed to   stories for all the likely outcomes. I volunteered to write the one that said “Trump wins. ”  Based on the polling data, it felt fantastical and pointless, like designing a Super Bowl ring for the Cleveland Browns. “Biggest upset of the modern era?” I asked Post political reporter Dan Balz, trying to use the right tone in this story that nobody would ever read. Balz said that was right. Then the polls started to close. And it turned out that I am not a time traveler. About 10 p. m. as the tide turned against Clinton, the editors started killing or reshaping stories they had assigned hours before. They axed CLINTON, a story about the history Clinton would make as the first woman to win the White House. They ordered a rewrite of GOP, which was supposed to tell readers how  —   with Trump defeated  —   the GOP was licking its wounds and looking ahead to 2020. Across the newsroom, paragraphs were being deleted en masse. An entire presupposed version of the future was disappearing. It wasn’t the future after all. Finally, at 2:32 a. m. the Associated Press called Wisconsin.  Trump was over the top.  “PUB TRUMP WINS STORY,” I wrote to the editors, giving the order to publish the story I’d written earlier. “Donald John Trump has been projected as the winner of the presidential election, according to the Associated Press. . .. His victory on Tuesday was the biggest surprise of the modern presidential era. . .. ”     (Jabin   Washington Post)   That night, I arrived home about 4 a. m. to a quiet house. I found a stale beer in the back of the fridge.  In the past, I’d always been able to step out of my job at times like this.  No matter how big the day’s story was, there was always a bigger world, which was still spinning unaffected by the murder I’d covered in Northeast Washington or the natural disaster or the congressional vote I’d just witnessed. But this story was too big to step out of.  As I sat on the couch with my nasty pale ale, it occurred to me that I would be living in the story, from that point on. A few days later, I was interviewed by another German reporter. He asked if these past nine months, the greatest ad ven ture in my life as a journalist, had been for naught. “Do you feel like your work perhaps did not matter at all?” he said. I didn’t feel like that.  It did matter. But, in an election as long and wild as this, a lot of other stories and other people mattered, too. I did my job. The voters did theirs. Now my job goes on. I’ll seek to cover Trump the president with the same vigor as I scrutinized Trump the candidate. And now I know how to do it.  David A. Fahrenthold is a Post staff writer.
