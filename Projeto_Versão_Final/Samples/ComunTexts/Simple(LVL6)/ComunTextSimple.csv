"NEARLY A THOUSAND YEARS AGO, an enslaved storyteller named Aesop became famous for marvelous fables and stories he created, and perhaps the most beloved of his tale is, ""Androcles and the Lion.""  In the story Androcles, also a slave, suffered terribly at the hands of one of the cruelest masters in all of Rome.  No wonder that at the first chance he got, Androcles ran away.  Bolting straight into the woods, he ran further and further until, exhausted, he could not move another step.  Two days went by, and Androcles could find no food or water anywhere.  ""I picked the wrong time of the year to run away!"" Androcles despaired.  ""The fruit and berries are all dried.  The nuts are long gone. How did I manage to end up in the only part of the forest that has no streams or running water?  Things can’t get any worse for me.""   If only that were true!  ""How did I manage to end up in the only part of the forest that has no streams or running water?""  Just then, Androcles heard a lion's roar - and not from a safe distance away but close, and coming closer!  Panicked, he sprang to his feet and ran.  As he fled through the bushes, he stumbled over the root of a tree.  Imagine his horror when Androcles realized his foot was stuck!  Each second the lion bounded closer and closer.  Androcles froze in fear. ""I'm doomed!"" he realized with dread.   But when the great beast came up to him, instead of attacking him the lion lowered its head and moaned.  The beast looked up with a strange expression.  Then the lion held out its right paw.  Covered in blood it was, and much swollen.  ""That looks nasty,"" Androcles said with sympathy, and the lion moaned like a sad little kitten.  It thrust its paw closer to Androcles.  ""Ah!"" says Androcles with understanding, ""that's one nasty thorn in your paw.""  The lion moaned, nodding, and stared at him with those big sad eyes.  ""Wait a minute!"" says Androcles. ""You're not thinking you want ME to pull out that thorn?""  Androcles and the Lion  Androcles thought, ""I would be out of my mind to take out that thorn!  It would hurt the lion and I'd be so close it could just take one swipe of me and that would be it!""  But the lion carried on in such a way and looked so pitiful and hopeless that Androcles was reminded of the wrenching pain he often felt after beatings by his slavemaster, and his heart relented. ""Well,"" said Androcles,  ""it's not as if my prospects were that great surviving in the woods, anyway.""   He gently wrapped both hands around the lion's paw.  ""Now hold still,"" he whispered.  Taking the thorn with two fingers, in one quick stroke he twisted and drew it out. The lion roared with pain, but soon after found such relief with the thorn gone that he fawned upon Androcles and showed, in every way that he knew to whom he owed the relief.  ""Give me a minute,"" said Androcles, wondering why he was talking aloud to a lion.  He wrapped some clean leaves around the wound and tied the bandage with long weeds.    ""Give me a minute,"" said Androcles, wondering why he was talking aloud to a lion.  The lion limped off.  Androcles freed himself of the tree root and just as he was wondering what his fate would be, there came the lion back again, this time with a young deer that it had slain.  Androcles was able to cook it on a fire and have his first meal in days. Every day the lion would bring more food. Androcles would pet the beast on his head and talk to it in a tender way.  He became quite fond of the huge creature.  But one day a number of soldiers came marching through the forest and found Androcles. As he could not explain what he was doing, they took him prisoner and brought him back to the town from which he had fled. Here his master soon found him and brought him before the authorities. Soon Androcles was condemned to death for fleeing from his master. Now it used to be the custom in ancient Rome to throw murderers and other criminals to the lions in a huge circus.  While the unlucky criminals were punished, the public would watch the spectacle of combat between them and the wild beasts.  Soon Androcles was condemned to death for fleeing from his master.  So Androcles was condemned to be thrown to the lions, and on the appointed day he was led forth into the Arena and left there alone with only a spear to protect him from the lion. The Emperor was in the royal box that day and gave the signal for the lion to come out and attack Androcles. But when it came out of its cage and got near Androcles, what do you think it did? Instead of jumping upon him, it fawned upon him and stroked him with its paw and made no attempt to do him any harm. It was of course the lion which Androcles had met in the forest. The Emperor, astonished at seeing such a strange behavior in so cruel a beast, summoned Androcles to him and demanded to know how it happened that this particular lion had lost all its cruelty of disposition. So Androcles told the Emperor all that had happened to him and how the lion was showing its gratitude for his having relieved it of the thorn.  The Emperor, convinced this must be the work of enchantment, pardoned Androcles and ordered his master to set him free.  Androcles then asked if the lion could be freed as well.  The  Emperor wasn't one to fool around with enchantments, and so he granted this wish, too.  From then on, whenever Androcles walked the streets of Rome, the lion marched by his side.   Androcles and the Lion  No one bothered Androcles ever again, as I'm sure you can imagine. And we can end this story by saying that Androcles and his lion lived happily ever after."
"The King and Queen invited all the fairies in the kingdom to a Naming Party for the baby.  And what a party it was!  Plates and silverware of pure gold were set with care before each guest.  One fairy, whose name was Maleficent, had left 50 years before and had not been seen in all that time, showed up at the door.  Quickly the King and Queen whispered to the servants they must quickly find a place setting for the new guest.  Alas, the plate and the silverware the servants could find were not of pure gold.  This made the old fairy very angry.  Soon it was time for each Fairy to give her blessing to the baby.  When it came to Maleficent’s turn, she stood up and pointed her long scraggly finger at the sleeping baby girl in the cradle.  “I declare, before all of you,” Maleficent called out, “that this child, on her 16th birthday, shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel, and die!”  Sleeping Beauty With a whoosh of smoke, the evil fairy vanished.  Everyone cried out with alarm, as you can imagine.  But one fairy had not yet given the baby her blessing.  The King and Queen asked this fairy, whose name was Merryweather, to reverse the curse.  Merryweather shook her head sadly –  that she could not do.  But she could soften the curse.   “On her 16th birthday,” said Merryweather, “when the Princess pricks her finger on the spinning wheel, she will not die and instead will fall asleep for 100 years.”  “Asleep for 100 years!” said the Queen.  “After our daughter turns 16, we will not know her anymore!”  The King ordered every spinning wheel in the kingdom to be brought to the palace and burned.  To be extra sure the Princess would not be anywhere near a spinning wheel, he also ordered Merryweather, along with two other fairies, Flora and Fauna, to take the baby far away into the forest.   Sleeping Beauty The fairies would raise the child in a cottage deep in the woods.  They would keep her safe until after her 16th birthday.  Then it would be safe to bring the Princess, who had been named Aurora, back to the castle.  Aurora grew up knowing no others than the three fairies, whom she knew as her aunts.  The animals of the forest were her friends and companions.  The birds and the deer, the chipmunks and the rabbits, followed her around as she fed them treats and cooed to them.     From the time she was little, Aurora was told she must stay inside the hills that surrounded them.  She must never go beyond those hills!  That was fine with her, as the woods surrounding the cottage had plenty of room to play.  One day when Aurora came home, she found her three aunts preparing for a party.  “What’s going on?” she said.  “Tonight we celebrate your 16th birthday!” said Flora.   One day when Aurora came home, she found her three aunts preparing for a party. “Tonight?” said Aurora.  “That means tomorrow I go back to the castle.”  “Yes, you do!” said Merryweather.  “We have kept you safe from that spinning wheel for 16 years. Starting tomorrow, it will be time for you to resume your royal life as a princess.”   “And the first thing will be for you to get married,” said Fauna.    “Married, already?” said Aurora.  “Who am I supposed to marry?”  “No need to worry about that,” said Fauna with a wave of her hand. “Even if he’s a bit strange or even on the horrid side, it's a small matter.”  “And he comes from a fine family!” added Flora with a quick smile.  “Wait a minute!” said Aurora, pulling back.  “What do you mean, on the horrid side?” “It’s best not focus on such things, dear,” said Merryweather.  ""You won't need to spend much time with him, after all.""  ""Wait a minute!"" said Aurora, pulling back.  “Just do everything your husband tells you to do,” said Flora. “And you will be fine.”  “This is not turning out like I thought!” cried Aurora.  “How long do I have to stay married?”   ""For your whole life, of course,"" said Fauna.  “No, this is all wrong!”  Aurora turned to her three aunts and said in a firm voice,  “I would rather prick my finger on a spinning wheel and fall asleep for 100 years than to marry someone I do not want! Maybe by the time I wake up, times will be different and people won’t have to get married if they don’t want to!”  She ran out the door.  ""No, this is all wrong!""  “Dear me!” said Merryweather to the other two fairies.  “I don’t believe that went over very well.”  Aurora ran into the woods where her animal friends lived. A deer hopped over to her, along with the rabbits and chipmunks.   “We have to get out of here,” she said.  Pointing to the forbidden hills, she said, “We will go over those hills.  I must find a spinning wheel, and quickly too, so I can prick my finger upon it and fall asleep for 100 years.”  Aurora and her animal friends marched through the hills.  On the other side, she looked around.  The world was much like the world closer to her cottage.  However one thing was different - in front of her was a road.  In the distance she heard a clopping sound and saw a cloud of dust - it was a carriage, coming their way.  As the rider approached, her animal friends scattered.  It was a carriage, coming their way. “Hail!” said the stranger.  “I’m afraid my carriage scared away your pets.  May I give you a lift? Or do you need some kind of assistance?”  Aurora had never seen a man before.  But she couldn’t think about that.  Unless she could find a spinning wheel, her aunts with their magic could find her and whisk her back to the palace, where she'd have to marry that horrid prince.   “Actually,” Aurora said slowly to the stranger, “there is something that I need.”  “What’s that?” said the stranger, hopping out of the carriage.  Very nicely dressed he was, and well mannered, too.  “A spinning wheel,” said Aurora.  Sleeping Beauty  “A spinning wheel!” said the stranger.  “But there are none left in the land – everyone knows that.”    “Well, you see,” said Aurora, rubbing her hands together, “I have this friend.  She needs to find a spinning wheel, and right away, too.”  Aurora looked directly at the stranger.  ""It's terribly important.""  The stranger returned her gaze.  He said in a low voice, “I may know of one.  But this must stay between you and me.”  Aurora nodded.  “Not far from here lives an old woman who spun yarn all her life.  When the order came to burn all the spinning wheels, she could not bear to let go of the beloved spinning wheel that had been in her family for generations.  She came to me.” He said in a low voice, ""I may know of one.  But this must stay between you and me.""  The stranger pointed down the road. “She knew I’m a prince from the kingdom down that way, and she begged me to store it safely for her. I put it in the attic room of my castle tower.  No one ever goes there.  Once the 16 years are over and the Princess Aurora returns, I intend to return it to her.”   ""Will you take me to your castle tower?"" said Aurora.  “I shouldn’t,” said the Prince.  After a moment, he added, “Of course, yes. I will.”  When they arrived at his castle tower, they both stepped out of the carriage.  The prince said, “You are not doing this for your friend, are you?”  ""I shouldn't,"" said the Prince.  After a moment, he added, ""Of course, yes.  I will.""  “Thank you for taking me here,” said Aurora in a firm voice.  “I will remember your kindness.  Now if you please, I must do what I have to do.”  Aurora turned and climbed the winding tower staircase, up to the very last stair at the top.  There was a wooden door in front of her, and it creaked open.  Inside, all was dark and musty.  Aurora could barely see in front of her for all the spider webs.     But she pushed the spider webs aside and stepped forward. There in the middle of the room was a spinning wheel.  From the rose-colored light coming through the small attic window, she could tell the sun was setting.  “I hope this works,” she said, “before it’s too late.” Aurora held out her finger on the tip of the spindle.  One prick and a tiny droplet of blood dripped from her finger.  At once, Aurora felt dizzy and fell onto an old dusty velvet blanket on the floor.  There she fell into a deep sleep.  Moments later, all the others in the castle, servants and royals alike, fell asleep as well.  So did the prince, who was still waiting for her outside the tower door.  Almost immediately, thorns and vines sprung up and wrapped around the castle so thickly that no human or beast could pass through.   For 100 years, Aurora and the others in and around the castle slept soundly.  For 100 years, Aurora and the others in and around the castle slept soundly.   After 100 years, Aurora blinked her eyes awake.  At that very moment, all others in and around the castle woke up, too.  Everyone started to do what they had been doing the moment before they had fallen asleep. The thorns and vines around the castle melted away.  Aurora stepped down the tower staircase.  There stood the prince, rubbing his eyes.  He was still waiting for her.  ""I feel different,"" said the prince.  ""Do you?""  She nodded, and they smiled.  They stepped into the prince’s carriage.  They were both hungry, and he headed for the market square.   ""I feel different,"" said the prince.  ""Do you?""  She nodded, and they smiled.  But instead of the market square the prince remembered, in the very same place bustled a whole new world, completely different from the one they had known.  After 100 years, such marvels on the street!  Bicycles and streetcars, telephones and streetlights.  Shops the likes of which they had never seen!   Perhaps best of all, they learned that in this strange new world, it was quite all right for women and men to get to know each other - if they fell in love, so be it, and if they did not, well, that was fine, too.   Sleeping Beauty  Aurora and the prince took each other’s hand. Because getting to know each other better was exactly what each of them wanted to do. "
"THERE WAS ONCE a very rich merchant who had three daughters.  Being a man of sense, he spared no cost for their education. His daughters grew to be very beautiful but the first two daughters cared little about their learning.  The youngest was called Beauty, a special name that made her sisters very jealous of her, but this she hardly noticed as she was forever absorbed in one good book or another.   The two elder sisters had a great deal of pride because they were rich. They gave themselves ridiculous airs, and would not visit other merchants' daughters, nor keep company with any persons but those of the highest standing. They went out every day to parties, balls, plays, concerts, and so forth, and they laughed at their youngest sister who spent so much of her time with a book in front of her face. One day the merchant learned terrible news - his ship that had on board hundreds of bolts of cloth and silks he had purchased, was lost at sea.  Overnight, his entire fortune vanished!    The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.  The merchant told his children with tears in his eyes that they must live there and work for their living. The two older daughters answered that they would never have to leave the town, for they had several prominent merchants who they were sure would be glad to marry them, though they no longer had a fortune. But the good ladies were mistaken, for their lovers slighted and forsook them in their poverty. As they were not liked on account of their pride, everybody said: They do not deserve to be pitied, we are very glad to see their pride humbled.  Let them go and give themselves quality airs in milking the cows and minding their chickens, like the rest of us. But, added they, we are extremely concerned for Beauty.  She is such a sweet-tempered creature who speaks kindly to everyone rich or poor, and has such a friendly, gracious nature.

She is such a sweet-tempered creature who speaks kindly to everyone rich or poor, and has such a friendly, gracious nature.  The family had no choice but to move to a small country house at a great distance from town.  When the family moved to their country house, the merchant applied himself to farming. Beauty rose at four in the morning before the others awoke and made haste to light the fire, clean the house, and prepare breakfast for the family. In the beginning she found the work very difficult for she was not used to this sort of hard labor.  But in less than two months, she grew stronger and healthier than ever.

""See how well-suited she is to a life of menial labor."" The family had lived about a year in the country house when the merchant received stunning news in a letter. The ship that the merchant was sure had been lost at sea had, in fact, safely arrived at port! The family rejoiced in this sudden turn of fortune. When the two older daughters saw their father ready to set out to claim his lost ship, one begged him to bring back for her a necklace of gems, the other demanded a thick golden chain, and Beauty asked only for a rose. The good man set off on his journey. When he came to where the ship was docked, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board.  After a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and the gold chain he had promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, he led his horse deep into the woods.  As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized that he was hopelessly lost. Worse, a sudden rain storm drenched him and then a snow storm struck.  He knew he might well starve to death from the cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then, looking far off into the distance, he saw a small light blinking. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a palace lit with candles from top to bottom.

As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized that he was hopelessly lost. Worse, a sudden rain storm drenched him and then a snow storm struck.  He knew he might well starve to death from the cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then, looking far off into the distance, he saw a small light blinking. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a palace lit with candles from top to bottom. Beauty and the Beast The merchant hastened to the palace and was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. Seeing a large stable open, he led his horse inside.  Finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished, fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him safely to a post and walked towards the house, where he still saw no one. Entering a large hall, he found a good fire and a table set out with plenty of steaming food. Someone must live here in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they? He drew near the fire to dry his soaked  clothes. ""I hope,"" he thought, ""the master of this house or his servants will excuse the liberty I take. I am sure it will not be long before some of them appear.""  He waited a considerable time until the clock struck eleven, and still nobody came.  At last the merchant was so hungry that he could stand it no longer.  Trembling, he took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls. After this he drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand rooms with magnificent furniture, until he came to a bedroom. In the middle of the room was a four-poster bed covered by a red velvet canopy draped with fringes.  As he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.   It was ten the next morning before the merchant awoke. As he rose, he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. This palace must belong to some kind fairy, he thought, who has seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found a mug of hot chocolate ready made on a little table. ""Thank you, good Madam Fairy,"" said he aloud, ""for being so careful as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors.""  The good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse.  Passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered one from a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash like thunder.  Spinning around, there loomed a huge monster!  With two tusks in his mouth, fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back, the beast roared: ""Mortal! Who said you can pluck my rose?"" ""Please, sir!"" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life. ""I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment.  Then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission.""  ""You are a thief!"" boomed the beast. ""You must give your life for this crime!""  The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but he to support them. ""My lord,"" said he, ""I beseech you to forgive me!  Indeed, I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose for one of my daughters, who asked only for that from my travels."" ""You say you have daughters,"" replied the monster. ""I will forgive you, on one condition.  That one of them comes willingly to suffer in your place. Swear that if any of your daughters refuses to come, you will return here in three months yourself and face your fate.""  So the merchant swore. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.  As soon as he got into his house, his daughters came rushing round to greet him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way. He gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the gold chain to his second daughter, and then the rose to his youngest.  As he gave it, he sighed.

When the two older daughters saw their father ready to set out to claim his lost ship, one begged him to bring back for her a necklace of gems, the other demanded a thick golden chain, and Beauty asked only for a rose.  Beauty and the Beast The good man set off on his journey. When he came to where the ship was docked, oh such problems there were over who properly owned the ship and the merchandise on board.  After a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose, he came back as poor as before, especially after he bought the fine new necklace and the gold chain he had promised to his two older daughters. Thinking he might come upon a rosebush to satisfy the wish of his youngest daughter, he led his horse deep into the woods.  As the sun set and the wind began to howl, the poor man realized that he was hopelessly lost. Worse, a sudden rain storm drenched him and then a snow storm struck.  He knew he might well starve to death from the cold or hunger, or be devoured by the wolves, whom he heard howling all round him. Then, looking far off into the distance, he saw a small light blinking. Going on a little farther, he noticed it came from a palace lit with candles from top to bottom. Beauty and the Beast The merchant hastened to the palace and was greatly surprised at not meeting anyone in the outer courts. Seeing a large stable open, he led his horse inside.  Finding both hay and oats, the poor beast, who was almost famished, fell to eating very heartily. The merchant tied him safely to a post and walked towards the house, where he still saw no one. Entering a large hall, he found a good fire and a table set out with plenty of steaming food. Someone must live here in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they? He drew near the fire to dry his soaked  clothes. ""I hope,"" he thought, ""the master of this house or his servants will excuse the liberty I take. I am sure it will not be long before some of them appear.""  Someone must live in the house, he thought, but who? And where were they?  He waited a considerable time until the clock struck eleven, and still nobody came.  At last the merchant was so hungry that he could stand it no longer.  Trembling, he took a leg of chicken and ate it in two mouthfuls. After this he drank a few glasses of wine. Growing more courageous, he went out of the hall and crossed through several grand rooms with magnificent furniture, until he came to a bedroom. In the middle of the room was a four-poster bed covered by a red velvet canopy draped with fringes.  As he was very tired and it was past midnight, he concluded it was best to shut the door and go to sleep.     Chapter 3: The Beast It was ten the next morning before the merchant awoke. As he rose, he was astonished to see a good suit of clothes laid out on the bed that would fit him perfectly. This palace must belong to some kind fairy, he thought, who has seen and pitied my distress. He then returned to the great hall where he had supped the night before, and found a mug of hot chocolate ready made on a little table. ""Thank you, good Madam Fairy,"" said he aloud, ""for being so careful as to provide me a breakfast. I am extremely obliged to you for all your favors.""  The good man drank his chocolate and then went to look for his horse.  Passing through an arbor of roses he remembered Beauty's request to him, and gathered one from a branch on which were several. Immediately he heard a great crash like thunder.  Spinning around, there loomed a huge monster!  With two tusks in his mouth, fiery red eyes surrounded by bristles, and horns coming out of its head and spreading over its back, the beast roared: ""Mortal! Who said you can pluck my rose?""  ""Mortal!  Who said you can pluck my rose?""  ""Please, sir!"" said the merchant in fear and terror for his life. ""I promised my daughter to bring her home a rose and forgot about it till the last moment.  Then I saw your beautiful garden and thought you would not miss a single rose, or else I would have asked your permission.""  ""You are a thief!"" boomed the beast. ""You must give your life for this crime!""  The merchant fell on his knees and begged for his life for the sake of his three daughters who had none but he to support them. ""My lord,"" said he, ""I beseech you to forgive me!  Indeed, I had no intention to offend in gathering a rose for one of my daughters, who asked only for that from my travels.""  Beauty and the Beast ""You say you have daughters,"" replied the monster. ""I will forgive you, on one condition.  That one of them comes willingly to suffer in your place. Swear that if any of your daughters refuses to come, you will return here in three months yourself and face your fate.""  So the merchant swore. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.  As soon as he got into his house, his daughters came rushing round to greet him, clapping their hands and showing their joy in every way. He gave the necklace to his eldest daughter, the gold chain to his second daughter, and then the rose to his youngest.  As he gave it, he sighed. Taking his rose, he mounted his horse and rode home.  ""Oh, thank you, father!"" they all cried.  But the youngest added, ""Father, why did you sigh so deeply when you gave me my rose?"" ""Oh, it is nothing,"" said the merchant.  But Beauty wondered.  For several days they lived happily together.  Only Beauty noticed that her father would often stare out the window,  gloomy and sad.  When she approached him and asked what was the matter, he would refuse to say.  Nothing she could do would cheer him up. After begging him over and over to share what was on his mind, at last he gathered together his three daughters and relayed to them his fatal adventure.   Immediately the two eldest set up lamentable outcries, blaming poor Beauty, and said all manner of ill-natured things to her. Beauty spoke: ""Since the monster will accept one of his daughters,"" said she, ""I will deliver myself up to all his fury. I am happy in knowing that my death will save my father's life, and be a proof of my tender love for him.""  ""Beauty, I am charmed with your kind and generous offer,"" said the merchant. ""But I cannot let you do this. I am old and have not long to live.  I will lose only a few years at the most.""  ""It was the rose I asked for that was the cause of your undoing,"" said Beauty. ""You will not go to the palace without me!  And you cannot stop me from following you."" Indeed, she made all the necessary preparations for herself.  Her sisters were secretly delighted at the prospect of getting rid of her once and for all. The next day, the merchant took Beauty behind him on his horse, as was the custom in those days, and rode off to the palace of the beast. When he got there and they alighted from his horse, the doors of the house opened, and what do you think they saw there? Nothing.   So they went up the steps and went through the hall into the dining room.  There they saw a table spread with all manner of beautiful glasses and plates and dishes and silk napkins, with plenty of food steaming and hot. They waited and waited, thinking the owner of the house must soon appear.  At last the merchant said, ""Let's sit down and see what happens then."" When they sat down, invisible hands passed them things to eat and drink.  And so they ate and drank to their heart's content. When they arose from the table it arose too, and disappeared through the door as if it were being carried by invisible servants. Suddenly the Beast filled the doorway. ""Is this your youngest daughter?"" he roared.  When the merchant said that it was, the Beast said, ""Is she willing to stay here with me?""  He stared at Beauty, who said in a trembling voice, ""Yes, sir.""  ""Well then, no harm shall befall you,"" said the Beast.  With that he led the merchant to his horse and said to him, ""Honest man, go your ways and never think of coming here again.""  Her father gone, the Beast returned to Beauty and said to her, ""This house with everything inside of it is yours.  If you desire anything, all you need to do is to clap your hands and say the word, and it will be brought to you."" With that he made a sort of bow and went away. So Beauty lived in the home of the Beast and was waited on by invisible servants.  Whenever she wanted, she had only to clap her hands and whatever food or drink she desired would appear.  If there was a book she wanted to read, she need only to clap and say the title, and the book would appear in her hands.  As you can imagine, this was rather a lovely life.  Yet after awhile, she became tired of the solitude.  One day, the Beast came to her to see how she was getting on.  He looked as scary as ever, but she had been so well treated that she had lost a great deal of her terror of him. They spoke about the garden and the house and her father's business and all manner of things.  Soon her fear of the beast was completely gone."
"Part 1: A Girl Named Cinderella ONCE UPON A TIME a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  It was Cinderella who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  Cinderella who cooked the meals. Cinderella who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.  Cinderella Story “What a mess you are!” her two stepsisters laughed.  That is why they called her “Cinderella.”  One day, big news was announced in their village.  It was time for the Prince to find a bride, and the King and Queen were going to have a ball!  All of the young ladies of the land were invited to come.  The stepsisters were wild with joy. They would wear their most beautiful gowns and fix their hair in the most splendid way. No doubt they would be the one to win the favor of the Prince!  Cinderella now had extra work to do.  She had to sew two fabulous gowns for her step-sisters in the latest fashion.    No doubt they would be the one to win the favor of the Prince!  “Faster!” shouted one stepsister.  “You call that a dress?” screamed the other.    “Oh, dear!” said Cinderella.  “When can I–“  The stepmother marched into the room.  “When can you WHAT?”  Cinderella Story “Well,” said the girl, “when will I have time to make my own dress for the ball?”  “You?” barked the stepmother.  “Who said YOU were going to the ball?”  “Did you hear that?” One stepsister rolled back with laughter. ""Cinderella, going to the ball?""   “Looking like THAT?""  Her stepsisters roared with laughter.  ""They'd never let that mess in the front door!""    Cinderella thought to herself, “I may look like a mess but I am not a mess, not really, And if I could, I WOULD go to the ball.”  Soon the big day came.  Poufed and pampered, the stepmother and stepsisters were ready to leave for the big night.  Cinderella Story    Part 2: The Big Party A fine carriage arrived to pick them up. The stepmother and stepsisters hopped inside.   “Good-bye!” called Cinderella.  “Have a good time!” But the stepmother and stepsisters did not turn to respond.  The carriage door shut and off they were, in a cloud of dust.  “Ah!” groaned Cinderella as the carriage clip-clopped down the cobblestone street.  “If only there was a way for me to go to the ball, too!”  Then - Poof!  All of a sudden, in front of her stood a fairy.  “You called?” said the Fairy. Cinderella Story “I did?” said Cinderella.  “Who are you?”  “Your Fairy Godmother, of course!  I know what you wish, and I have come to grant it.”  “But…” said Cinderella, “my wish is impossible.”  “Excuse me!” said the Fairy Godmother in a huff.  “Did I not just show up out of thin air?”  “I suppose you did,” said Cinderella. “Did I not just show up out of thin air?""  “Then let me be the one to say what is possible or not!”  “Well, all right,"" said Cinderella.  She looked down at her dirty clothes. “But look at me.  I cannot go to the ball.”  “You do look a bit of a mess, child,” said the Fairy Godmother gently.  “Even if I had something nice to wear,"" said the girl, ""I would have no way to get there.""  “Dear me, all of that is possible,” said the Fairy. She tapped her wand on Cinderella’s head.  Cinderella Story At once, Cinderella was perfectly clean.  What's more, she was dressed in a beautiful blue gown!  Her hair was set up high on her head in a golden band.  “This is amazing!” said Cinderella.  “Who said I was done?” said the Fairy Godmother.  She tapped her wand again. At once, a beautiful carriage came to be, with a driver and four white horses.  Cinderella Story “Am I dreaming?” said Cinderella, looking around her in astonishment.  “It's as real as real can be,” said the Fairy Godmother.  “But there is one thing you must know.”  “What is that?”  “The magic lasts only to midnight.  At the stroke of midnight, it will be over.  Everything will go back to how it was before.”  “Then I must be sure to leave the ball before midnight,” said Cinderella.  “At the stroke of midnight, it will be over.""  “Smart cookie,” said the Fairy Godmother.  She stepped back. “My work here is done.” In a puff of smoke, the Fairy Godmother was gone.  Cinderella looked around.  ""Did that even happen?""  But there she was in a fine gown, with a golden band in her hair.  And there were her driver and four horses.  “Coming?” called the driver. ""I suppose it did,"" said Cinderella.  She stepped into the carriage, and they were off.     Part 3: The Ball During the ball, the Prince felt despondent.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “You would think you weren't at a royal ball your father and I are hosting just for you, so you can find a bride.”  “I know you and Father are looking out for me,” said the Prince.  Yet something was wrong. He had already met most of the young women at the ball, and after he said “Hello,” there was nothing more to say.  ""Look!""  Someone pointed to the front door of the ballroom, at the top of the stairs.    All heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and stepped with grace and elegance. Who was she?  No one knew.  Cinderella Story “There is something about that young lady,” said the Prince to himself.  “I will ask her to dance.” He walked over to Cinderella.  “Have we met?” said the Prince.  “I am pleased to meet you now,” said Cinderella with a bow. “I feel as if I know you,” said the Prince.  “But of course, that's impossible.”  “I feel as if I know you,"" said the Prince.  “Many things are possible,” said Cinderella, “if you wish them to be true.”  ""Do you really believe that?"" said the Prince.  ""I know it,"" said Cinderella.   The Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then again. All the time they were talking and laughing.  Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he staying dance after dance with HER?” they said. “Give someone else a chance.  How rude!”  Cinderella Story But all the Prince wanted to do was to stay with Cinderella.   In fact, they danced so long that Cinderella did not see the clock.     Part 4: The Clock Strikes “Dong!” struck the clock.  Cinderella looked up.    “Dong!” rung the clock again.    She turned to the clock.  “Oh, my!” she cried.  “It's almost midnight!”  “Dong!” called the clock.    “Why does it matter?” said the Prince.  ""The night is young.""  “Dong!"" called the clock.  “Dong!” rung the clock again.  “I must go!” said Cinderella.    “Dong!” went the clock.  “But we just met!” said the Prince.   “Dong!” rung the clock.  “I must GO!” said Cinderella.  She ran to the steps.  “Dong!” cried the clock.  “I cannot hear you,” said the Prince.  “The clock is too loud!”  “Dong!” rung the clock.  “Goodbye!” said Cinderella. The ran up the stairs as fast as she could.  “Dong!” went the clock.  “Please, stop for a moment!” said the Prince.  “Oh, dear!” she said as one glass slipper fell off her foot on the stair.  But Cinderella kept running.  “Dong!” said the clock.  “Please wait a moment!” said the Prince.    “Dong!” rung the clock.  “Goodbye!” Cinderella turned one last time.  She rushed out the door.  “Dong!”  The clock was quiet. It was midnight.    “Wait!” called the Prince.  He picked up her glass slipper and dashed out the door to follow her.    Cinderella Story He looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere.  “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down forlornly at the glass slipper.  He noticed that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere that young maiden has the other glass slipper,” he said.  “I will find her, and when I do, I will ask her to be my bride!”     Part 5: The Search From village to village, and from cottage to cottage went the Prince.  One young woman after another tried to fit her foot inside the glass slipper.  But none could fit. He asked if they had the other glass slipper.  None did. And the Prince moved on.  At last the Prince came to Cinderella’s cottage.    “He is coming!” shrieked one stepsister as she looked out the window.  “He is here, at the door right now!” screamed the other stepsister.    At last the Prince came to Cinderella's cottage.  “Hush!” hissed the stepmother.  “He'll hear you!  Now get ready. One of you must fit your foot in that slipper, no matter what it takes!”  The stepmother swirled around to face Cinderella.  ""Get out of my sight,"" she glowered, ""Go to your room right now and stay there!""  The Prince knocked.  The stepmother flew open the door.  “Come in!” she said in a sweet, sultry voice. “I have two lovely daughters you must see.”  The first stepsister tried to fit her foot in the glass slipper.    Cinderella Story As hard as she tried, her foot could not squeeze in. The second step-sister tried to fit her foot inside, but no dice.  And neither of them had the other glass slipper.  “Are there any other young women in the house?” said the Prince.  “None,” said the stepmother.  “Then I will take my leave,” said the Prince.  “Maybe there is one more,” said Cinderella, stepping into the room.  “I thought you said there were no other young women here,” said the Prince.  “None who matter!” seethed the stepmother.  “Come here,” said the Prince warmly.  Cinderella stepped up to him.  The Prince got down on one knee and tried the glass slipper on her foot.    Cinderella Story It fit perfectly!  ""Well, I suppose I have the pair back again,"" said Cinderella.  And from her pocket she took out the other glass slipper!  “I knew it!” he cried.  “You are the one!”  “WHAT?” shouted a stepsister.    “Not HER!” screamed the other stepsister.  “This cannot BE!” shrieked the stepmother.    But it was too late.  The prince looked into her eyes.  He knew that this young woman was the very same one he had met and danced with, and loved talking to.  He did not see the cinders in her hair or the ashes on her face.  “I have found you!” he said.  “And I have found you,” said Cinderella.  And so Cinderella and the Prince were married, and they lived happily ever after."
"Part 1: One By One ONCE ON A FARM LONG AGO, a Mama Duck sat on her nest.  “How long must I wait for my babies to hatch? I have to sit here all by myself!”  But what could she do? A Mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch.    At last, the eggs began to crack.  One yellow duckling stepped out of its shell, then another.  Each little chick shook its wings. “Quack, quack!”  “Look at you!” cried Mama Duck with joy.  “You're all so cute!”  ""Look at you!"" cried Mama Duck with joy.  “Quack, quack, QUACK!” they said with pride.  “Come line up,"" said Mama Duck.  ""We will go down to the lake for your very first swim.”  She counted – one, two, three, four, five. “Oh dear!” she said with a frown.  “I had six eggs.  I should have six ducklings.”  Mama duck and chicks One large egg was still in the nest. “Well!"" said Mama Duck, ""it looks like that big egg will take more time.” So she went back to sit on her nest again and wait some more.    Part 2: Unlike The Others The next day, the big egg started to hatch!  Out popped a baby boy bird.   The Ugly Duckling Yet - my goodness! How different this one looked!  He was much larger than the others. He was not yellow, but dark-gray all over.  And after he stepped out of his egg, he walked with a funny wobble. One of the yellow ducklings pointed.  “What's THAT? He can't be one of us!”  “I have never seen such an ugly duckling!” said another.    “How can you say such a thing?” said Mama Duck in a very stern voice. “You are only one day old!  Your brother hatched from the very same nest as you did. Now line up. We will go to the lake for your very first swim.”  ""How can you say such a thing?"" said Mama Duck in a very stern voice.  All the way the other ducklings quacked, “Ugly!  Ugly! UGLY!” The Ugly Duckling did not know why the other ducklings were yelling at him.  He fell behind to take the last spot in line.   When they got to the lake, each yellow duck jumped in and swam behind Mama Duck.  When it was his turn, the Ugly Duckling jumped in too, and he started to paddle.  “At least he can swim,” Mama Duck thought to herself. When the yellow ducklings got out of the water and started to play, the Ugly Duckling tried to play with his brothers and sisters.  They yelled at him, “Go away! We will not play with you! You are ugly. And you walk weird!”  The Ugly Duckling When Mama Duck was close by, she would not let them talk this way.  “Be nice!” she would scold. But she was not always close by.     Part 3: Get Out! One day, one of the yellow ducklings said to the Ugly Duckling, “You know what?  You would do us a big favor if you just went away!” All of them started to quack: “GO!  Go away!”  “Why won’t they let me stay with them?” thought the Ugly Duckling.  He hung his head down low. “They must be right. I should go.”  That night, the Ugly Duckling flew over the farmyard fence to the other side of the lake.  There he met two grown-up ducks.  The Ugly Duckling “Can I please stay here for awhile?” said the Ugly Duckling.  “I have nowhere else to live.”  “What do we care?” said one of the ducks.  “It's a big lake.  Just don’t get in our way.”  “Woof! Woof!”  Suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by, chasing the two ducks.  They quickly flew up in the air, and their feathers fell down on the ground.  The poor Ugly Duckling froze in fear. The dog sniffed and sniffed at the Ugly Duckling, then it turned around and walked away.  “I am too ugly even for that mean old dog,” said the Ugly Duckling in a sorrowful voice.  The sky turned dark.  CRACK!  A bolt of lightning lit up the sky.  Then came a big storm, with heavy rains pouring down.  In just moments, the Ugly Duckling was soaked through and through. A cold wind started to blow.  CRACK!  A bolt of lightning lit up the sky.  “Brrr!” He held both wings close to his chest.  “If only there was someplace I could dry out.”  All at once, a tiny light blinked far off in the woods.  Could it be someone’s hut?  The Ugly Duckling flew to the door.  “Quack?” said he.  The door of the hut creaked open.  “What is all this noise?” said an old woman, looking right and left.  Her eyes were not that good, but she could hear. She looked down. “A duck!”  She picked up the Ugly Duckling and dropped him inside her hut. “You might as well stay here,"" she said.  ""But mind you, I expect you to lay eggs.”  A tomcat and hen both crept up to the Ugly Duckling.  “Who do you think you are?"" the tomcat hissed.  ""Coming here and taking up room by the fire!”     ""Who do you think you are?"" the tomcat hissed.  “Squawk!” said the hen.  “I'm the only one around here who lays eggs. You don't know the first thing about laying eggs.” “You got that right,” said the Ugly Duckling.  “I'm a boy duck.”  “Then why are you here?” sneered the tomcat.  “Didn't you hear what the old woman said?”  “Imposter!  Get out of here!” yipped the hen.    “Go away!"" jeered the tomcat.  The door was still a bit open, so the poor Ugly Duckling crept out the door and back into the storm.  “No one ever wants me,” said the Ugly Duckling with a tear in its eye.          Part 4: A New Lake The storm ended.  Finally he found another lake.  Looking in the water, the Ugly Duckling saw a reflection from above - a flock of large birds were flying overhead, above him.  He turned to admire them. They were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen.  Their long bodies and slender necks winged through the sky with ease and grace. He watched until the very last one had disappeared from view.    The Ugly Duckling The Ugly Duckling stayed at the lake as the days grew shorter.  The leaves turned deep red and gold, and fell to the ground.  Winter came, setting its blanket of white snow. The cold wind blew and the clouds darkened.   He had to dive into small holes in the ice to find fish to eat. Under the ice, it was all he could do to keep paddling so the water wouldn't freeze around him, trapping him underneath the lake.  The cold wind blew and the clouds darkened.  He became terribly tired. The ice got thicker still and the wind blew harder.  In a moment, two giant hands swept him up.  “You poor thing!” said a farmer. He held the Ugly Duckling close to his thick warm wool jacket.  ""You didn't fly south with the others?"" The farmer was carrying him someplace - where?    The next months were lovely.  Warmth from the heat of the fire and from the heart of the farmer enveloped our poor hero. For the rest of the winter, the farmer cared for the Ugly Duckling.       Part 5: Spring At last, spring came. Little dots of green spotted the tree branches. Short, bright flowers popped up from the ground.   “It's time for you to go back to the lake to swim again, as you were born to do,” said the farmer.  He took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him and set him on the water.  “I feel good!” said the young bird, flapping his wings.  “Why, I don't think I ever felt as strong as I do right now!”  Spring passed, then summer.  The leaves started to change colors when one day, the Ugly Duckling heard quiet splashing sounds behind him.  He turned around.  A flock of those same beautiful birds he had once seen winging through the sky now sat on the lake.  The leaves started to change colors when one day, the Ugly Duckling heard quiet splashing sounds behind him.  “Don't worry!” he said to the beautiful birds, holding out one of his wings.  “I am leaving. I won't make trouble for you.” When he happened to glance down at the lake, he saw a reflection in the water that looked like one of those beautiful birds.  Why was the bird so close to him? He jumped back. The reflection jumped back, too.  “What's this?” he thought, puzzled.  Our troubled hero stretched his neck and strangely, the reflection of the beautiful bird in the lake stretched its neck, too.  “Why are you leaving so soon?"" called out one of the beautiful birds.   ""Come back!” said another.    “Stay with us!” said yet another swan.  “We’ll be friends.”  The Ugly Duckling Then, the bird who used to be the Ugly Duckling realized what had happened.  He was no longer an ugly gray bird that wobbled when it walked.  He had grown into a beautiful swan!  Then a dark thought crossed his mind.  He had grown into a beautiful swan!  ""You only want me because I'm a swan and I look like you,"" said he.  ""That's not it at all!"" said the first swan who had spoken. ""We saw you all alone down here and thought you might want to join us.  We don't care how birds look.  Why, take a look at Pelican over there.""   ""No one would take me for a swan,"" squawked Pelican.    ""How did you end up with them?"" asked our hero, who used to be an Ugly Duckling.  ""Stayed up too late the night before,"" shrugged Pelican.  ""Slept till noon. My flock took off without me.  Was sure glad the swans came along when they did. Thanks, guys!""   Said the second swan who had spoken, ""And there's Egret.""   ""We don't care how birds look.""  ""What can I tell you?"" said Egret.  ""I love to ride those wind currents!  Then found out my entire flock was gone.  By then there was no way I could catch up.  If the swans didn't come along and invite me to join them, who knows where I'd be now?""   The hero who used to be an Ugly Duckling considered these stories, yet was still skeptical.  ""Winter may get a little cold on the lake,"" he said, ""but no one bothers me here.  And spring comes eventually.""   ""Eventually?"" said the first swan.  ""Why suffer if you don't have to? Where we fly to, the sun shines hot all day long. Imagine it - thick, delicious pondweed for as far as you can see.  Algae, waterside grasses, the works!""   ""I see your point,"" admitted our hero.  ""Besides,"" said the third swan, ""I bet you'd love to fly farther than just circling around this lake.  We sure do.""   ""Eventually?"" said the first swan.  ""Why suffer if you don't have to?""  Another good point.  Our hero often imagined how lovely it would be to stretch out and just fly, fly, and fly some more.  The bird who used to be an Ugly Duckling considered, ""These birds may be beautiful to look at, but they are also beautiful inside.  This is the flock for me.""   And so the entire flock, including their newest friend, flapped their wings together.  And in one moment they took off into the clear blue sky."
"IN THE SPRING OF 1607, three ships landed on the shores of what is now America.  About 100 men – no women were asked to come – stepped onto the sand to start a new life.   Pocahontas The men built 20 cabins and a fort to surround and protect the cabins.  They called their new town Jamestown.   But they were not the only ones living on that land.  Up and down the coast and for miles into the woods lived tribes of Native Americans.  This is the land that is now called Virginia.    Back then, it was called the Powhatan Confederacy.  One chief ruled over 30 tribes in the Powhatan Confederacy, and his name was Powhatan.   Chief Powhatan’s scouts told him that ships had landed on shore, and new men had built a fort and cabins.  They told him the new men spoke in words no one had ever heard before.  They wore clothes no one had ever seen before.   What Powhatan wanted to know most of all was, where did these strangers come from?  Why were they here? What did they intend to do?  And how would he become their Chief?   His scouts told him other news too, that was most odd.  They had planted no crops around the fort.  No canoes were anywhere near the fort, and the men did not even stand by the river to fish.  The men did not go into the woods to hunt, either. They had no arrows and bows.  Thought Powhatan, “These men do not know how to plant, ride a canoe, fish or hunt.  It will be easier than I thought to be their Chief.""   ""We will bring food to them – corn, beans and squash. Without us, they will starve.  Then I, Powhatan, who rules 30 tribes, will rule over them, too!”  “Father let me come with you!” said Powhatan’s daughter Pocahontas.  No one had seen her slip into the longhouse. “I want to see the fort, too.”  “Surely not!” said her father.  “You have work to do here.  When you are done, you may play with your sisters.”    “I play with them every day!” said Pocahontas.  “Father please, let me come with you!”   Powhatan smiled.   “Ah, my princess,” he said.  “How can I say no to that face?” Pocahontas beamed.  At long last, an adventure!  She felt sure that if she had to sew one more moccasin, or fill one more basket with berries, she would burst! So Chief Powhatan, leading a number of scouts carrying baskets of corn, beans and squash, and with Pocahontas beside them, all went to the fort.   When they got there, they set down the baskets and stepped back. In a minute, the men of Jamestown in their odd clothes and speaking their odd language came out of the fort to greet the visitors with smiles.  The gift was accepted. Pocahontas saw something else that made her smile, too.  Boys a bit older than she also came out with the men of Jamestown.  She waved to the boys, and they waved back. When the adults were trying to talk to each other using their arms and hands, she said to them, “Want to play?”    Pocahontas They did not understand her words.  But soon they were showing her how to play tag and stickball.  And she was showing them how to do cartwheels. After a while, Powhatan called, “Pocahontas! It’s time to go.” Every four or five days after that, Pocahontas came back with the others to the fort. Each time, Powhatan’s scouts carried corn, squash, and beans.  Sometimes for a special treat - maple sugar, too.  Pocahontas learned the names of her new friends – James, Nathaniel, Richard and Samuel. And they learned her name.  She also learned the name of their leader, John Smith.  The days became shorter and the rain stopped coming. The corn in the fields dried up.  The squash and the beans on the vine dried up.  Berries on the bushes dried up. “We cannot take food to the fort anymore,” said Powhatan.  “We need to save all we have so our people will make it through the winter.  We must go to the fort and tell them.”   When the men in the fort understood the news, they got angry.  They marched into their cabins.  They came out with guns, and shot the guns into the sky. Powhatan got angry, too.  He said, “I warn you, white men!  Do not go anywhere near our village!  If you do, you will be sorry!”  The men of Jamestown could not understand what Powhatan was saying.  But they could tell from his face that they were no longer friends.   Some time after that, John Smith was going through the woods looking for food.  He was close to the village of Powhatan - too close.  Powhatan’s brother and some of the tribe saw him pass.  In a flash, they jumped out at him.  They held John Smith down to the ground and took him back to Powhatan’s village. “Now it will be done, once and for all,” said Powhatan.  “I will be Chief to all the people in the fort.”  That winter, John Smith could not leave Powhatan's village.  Still, the Native Americans made him feel as comfortable as a prisoner can be.  Pocahontas also spent time with him.  Day after day, they would teach each other the language that each other’s people spoke.   As the snow melted, the people of Powhatan’s village started to get ready for a celebration.  Powhatan called John Smith into his longhouse.  “The festival will soon be here,” he said.  As the snow melted, the people of Powhatan's village started to get ready for a celebration.  “What festival?” said John Smith.  Now he could better understand what Powhatan was saying.  “The festival to mark the time when your people join my people.  When I become your Chief.”  “That will never happen!” said John Smith, scowling. Powhatan did not know the words the young man was saying.  But the Chief could tell that John Smith was angry.  “Your people have no choice!” said Powhatan. “If you will not join my tribe, you must die!”   No one saw Pocahontas slip into the longhouse.  Powhatan said: “Put his head on the rock!” Two strong braves grabbed John Smith and pushed his head down on a rock.  Powhatan lifted a large rock above him, ready to strike. “No!” the girl cried out.  All of a sudden, Pocahontas rushed up and bent over John Smith, placing her own head over his.    Powhatan held the rock high in the air. “Pocahontas!” he cried out.  “Move away!” “I will not move!” she said, turning her head to the side.  “Let him be.  Let all of them be!” Powhatan held up the rock.  Then, he lowered his arms.  “My daughter,” he said in a soft voice. “You are right.  One harm causes another.”  Powhatan set John Smith free.  Powhatan’s tribes brought food again to the men in the fort, this time smoked meat and fish.    In return, the men in the fort gave them glass beads and copper.  Now the moccasins sewn by Powhatan's people were decorated more beautifully than ever.  Both sides traded what they could, and each was the better for it."
"Chapter 1: King Uther LONG AGO IN ENGLAND, a wise and just king named King Uther ruled the land. Times were good and the people lived well.  King Uther called for Merlin the Magician, the most famous wizard in the land, to come to court. Merlin could see into the future, and that is how he knew the good days were not going to last.  But of such news King Uther and Queen Guinevere knew nothing, especially when they welcomed a child of their own into the world, a sweet baby boy.     At a castle party for the royal birth, Merlin the Magician asked the King to step aside for a word.  Said the Magician, “Sire, there is something you must know. Soon a great darkness will fall over this land.  Your child is in great danger. Allow me to take the baby far away. I will be sure to keep him safe.”  “Merlin!” said the King in surprise. “You are a great magician and you are my friend, too, But there is no way we would let anyone take away our child!”  Sadly, soon after the child’s birth the Queen died.  Not long after that, King Uther was killed in battle. That very night, Merlin swept into the castle and took the child.     The next morning, the royal nurse went into the nursery and to her alarm found an empty crib. In fear she, the nobles, and all the servants searched everywhere. But the baby was gone!  With no King or baby heir, there was no leader or heir to sit on the throne.  Darkness fell over the land.  Without a leader, no one was setting the laws or settling disputes. Men of high rank fought each other to be the king.  Robbers and bands of wild men ruled the streets of London.  Evil men broke into houses and took what they wanted. Travelers on the roads were jumped and robbed.  The people of England lived in fear.  Far away from the city in a quiet place lived good knight Sir Ector, with his two sons.  His first son was named Garth and the younger son, Arthur, had been adopted as a baby.  Years before, a stranger had come to Sir Ector with a baby and asked if Sir Ector would raise the child.  The old knight took the baby in his arms, glad for a second child. He named the baby Arthur and raised him as his own.  The Sword in the Stone King Arthur Legend of the Sword Story    Chapter 2:  A Stranger No More When Arthur was ten years old, the same stranger returned to Sir Ector’s home.  The stranger could read and write, and so Sir Ector hired him to teach his two sons. Garth could not sit still for lessons and he stopped coming.  But Arthur listened with wide eyes and learned everything. I bet you guessed by now who was that stranger – none other than Merlin the Magician himself.   At the end of each day when Arthur finished his chores, it was time for lessons.  Merlin would sit with Arthur for hours on end and teach him about the world. Arthur was a thin lad, not strong like his big brother Garth.  Merlin said not to worry about that - what mattered most was a strong heart inside. Merlin noticed how birds, foxes and deer followed Arthur about.  He could see that the boy's heart was strong indeed. By the time Arthur was 16, his brother Garth had become a knight and was now called Sir Garth. Arthur was eager to serve his big brother as squire.  With great concern, he took care of his big brother's battle garments and spears.  One day at lesson time, Merlin stood up and turned from the lad.  “What is it?” said Arthur.  “Arthur,"" said Merlin, ""I need to leave you now.”     Chapter 3: The Sword In The Stone That night, when the night was at its most dark, Merlin went to London’s market square.  He stood in the middle of the square, holding both arms high and he pointed his wand to the stars.  The next morning at dawn when people started to arrive at the market, they discovered something most odd. A white marble block stood in the center of the market square, and upon it a large stone.  What's more, embedded on top of the stone was a golden sword with its top half shining in the sun and the other half buried deep into the rock. None of this marvel had been there the day before!   Even more curious were these words etched on the blade: “Whoever pulls out this sword from this stone is the true King of England!”  As you can imagine, word spread quickly about the message and the strange sword in the stone.  Men flocked from far and wide to jump up to the white marble block and give the sword a yank. Each one tried but the sword stuck fast. It would not move.  One said in gloom, “There is no man alive who could pull this sword out of the stone!”  “We’ll see about that!” said a voice in the crowd.  The Duke of Cornwall, dressed in silks and ribbons, stepped up to the white marble block.  “Hear ye, hear ye!” he said. “I call for a tournament to be held one month from today for the strongest, finest knights in all of England. There will be contests, prizes, and a grand feast for all!” The Duke said to his wife, the Duchess, “If I know men, this tournament will draw champions from throughout the land.  The winner is sure to be strong enough to pull the sword from the the stone!”     Said the Duchess, “Good idea, my dear.  We will have a king again, at last!”  The people danced and cheered.  News of the tournament traveled fast.  From castle to village, to every far corner of the land, the news spread until at last, word got to the far-away home of Sir Ector.  Sir Garth heard the news when he was polishing his helmet.  “Arthur!” he called out.  Arthur was in the woods, feeding birds from his hand.  He set down a pile of seeds for the birds and another for the squirrels, then ran fast to see his brother.  “There you are!” said Garth.  “There's a tournament in London.  We must set out at once!”  Arthur couldn't be more delighted - he had never been more than a few miles from home.  He resolved to be the best squire ever for his brother! The lad ran back into the house.  In the courtyard his father, Sir Ector, was getting the horses ready.  Sir Ector and his sons rode through London on their way to the tournament.  Riding through the market square, something shiny glinted in the sun. “That sword looks like it goes right into the stone,” said Arthur.  “But how can that be? That's impossible.” Strangely, guards were standing all around it.  But why?  The father and his two sons reached the tournament. The young knight Sir Garth ran to get in line to register.  His father Sir Ector greeted many old friends – dukes, earls, barons, counts and countesses. Arthur sat in their tent, polishing his brother’s helmet till it shone bright.  A bugle sounded.  The tournament was about to begin! “Get my sword, Arthur!"" said Garth.    “Right away!” said Arthur.  But where was it? Arthur looked around in panic.  HIs brother's spear, battle-axe and dagger were right where they should be.  But where was the sword? “Garth…?” he said. “How about a battle-axe?”  “What are you talking about, Arthur?"" said his brother impatiently.  ""You know I need my sword!”    “I'll have it in a moment!” said Arthur.    “Be quick about it!” said Garth.  Arthur ran back into the tent.  Maybe he left Garth’s sword there?  He searched through the bag of armor and weapons.  How could he let such a thing happen? Then he had an idea.     Chapter 4: The Market Square Very fast, Arthur hopped on their horse and rode back to the market square.  The guards were not there anymore – they must have all gone to watch the tournament.    Arthur stepped onto the marble block.  “Let’s see if that sword can get unstuck.”  He took hold of the handle of the sword. He moved the sword a bit.  “Hey!” he thought, “it’s looser than I thought.”  With one big tug, the sword slid out.  Arthur was thrown back but the sword was safe in his hands.  The Sword in the Stone King Arthur Legend of the Sword Story “I will be sure to bring it right back,” he resolved.  Arthur tucked the sword under his chest and raced to where his brother was waiting.  “Here it is,” he said, panting, and he handed the sword to his brother.  Garth took one look.  “Oh!” he said in surprise.  “What?” said Arthur nervously.  But his brother had dashed out of the tent. Soon after, he heard his brother’s voice outside.  “Father, you must see this!” Garth and his father stepped in the tent.   “Look!” said Garth.  He pointed to the sword.  Sir Ector stared.  His face turned white.  “Garth,” said the father, facing his older son, “where did you get this sword?”  “It is mine!” said Garth, holding it close.    “Garth!” said the Father again in a low, stern voice.  “I will ask you one more time. Where did you get this sword?”  The young knight’s head dropped down.  “It was from Arthur,” he said.  “He lost my sword and somehow he found this one.”  “Arthur?” The father turned to his younger son.  “How is it that you came by this sword?”  “I’m sorry!” said Arthur.  “Father, I'll put it right back, I promise.  I only meant to borrow it when I pulled it from the stone!”   “You must take us to where you found this sword, Arthur.  At once!” The three of them rushed over to the market square.     Chapter 5: Now It's Back Arthur climbed onto the marble block.  “It came from here,” he said. He lifted the sword over his head.    Then he dropped the blade back into the stone. “Now it’s back in the stone.  Everything's all right now, isn't it?""  “Hey!” said Sir Garth.  “I still need a sword!”  He jumped up onto the marble block and grabbed the hilt of the sword.  He pulled and pulled, but it didn't move.  Garth shouted to Arthur, “What did you do to it?”  “Nothing!” said the lad.  “You must have done something!” cried Sir Garth.  “Hush, both of you!” said the father.  “It's better if no one sees or hears us.”  But it was too late.  A crowd had already started to gather.  “Hey, did you pull that sword out of the stone?” called one villager.   ""Yes,"" said Arthur, ""I did.""  “Hey, did you pull that sword out of the stone?"" called one villager.    “Do it again!” called another.    “Yes, let’s see it!”  ""Let's see you do it!""  ""Show us!""  Arthur put his hands around the golden handle.  With one tug, the blade slid out.  “Who are you?” called another voice. “What’s your name?”  “Arthur,” said the lad.  “Wait a minute, put that sword back!” A tall knight pushed forward from the crowd.  “Anyone can pull it out, once it’s already been pulled!”  “Go ahead.  Put it back, son,” said a voice.  It was the Duke of Cornwall, the one who had called for the tournament.  “All right,” said Arthur. He slipped the blade back into the stone with ease.  “Let me at it now!” said Duke.  He jumped up and grabbed the handle of the sword.  But pull and tug as he might, the sword would not move.  Not a bit.  Another knight tried.  Then another. None could move the sword. Some waited, thinking the longer they waited, surely the sword would loosen and they would have a better chance.  But when each man took his turn, the sword did not budge.  “Let the lad try now,” said the Duke of Cornwall.  “Arthur, go ahead.”   Arthur stepped up to the stone again - in one motion, he freed the blade.  This time, he held the sword high above his head.  The blade flashed in the sun.  Amazed, the crowd did not know what to think.  This time, he held the sword high above his head.  One voice called out, “Our new King!”  “That kid?” called another voice from the crowd. “That skinny boy to rule over us?” ""No way!"" shouted another voice.  “Stop!” shouted a commanding voice. All eyes turned around.  It was Merlin the Magician.  “I know this boy. I know his heart.  There is no one in England who has a heart bigger and stronger than his.  The sword has told us that this young man is to be the next King of England. And there is something else you must know!”  The crowd hushed.  “This lad,” said Merlin, pointing to Arthur, “is the true child of King Uther.  HE is the missing baby!”  Cheers began to ring out.  “Hail, King Arthur!” called a voice.  ""All hail, our new King!""     Sir Ector fell to his knees.  Then Sir Garth. One person after another fell to their knees.  All cheered. At last, a king had been chosen. A fresh young king and a new day for England!"
"Part 1: The Velveteen Rabbit A SOFT AND FLUFFY VELVETEEN RABBIT lived in a toybox in a Boy's room.  Each day, the Boy opened the toybox and picked up the Velveteen Rabbit. The Velveteen Rabbit felt as happy as the Boy.  Velveteen Rabbit  Then newer, brighter toys came into the toybox.  They had special tricks.  Some could move when the Boy pushed a button, and others bounced high.  The Velveteen Rabbit had no special tricks or buttons. After awhile, the Boy started to choose the other new toys.    At night, when the toys were back in the toy box, the other toys talked with pride about the fine things they could do. The Velveteen Rabbit was quiet.  There was not much to say.  Velveteen Rabbit The only other toy in the toy box that was soft and fluffy like the Velveteen Rabbit and could not do any fancy tricks was Cowboy Horse.  Cowboy Horse was old and most of his fur was worn away.  Cowboy Horse said to the Velveteen Rabbit, “Do not listen to the rest of them. Soft toys like us are really the lucky ones.  We get loved the most.  And when soft toys get loved enough, we can become Real.”  “What do you mean, 'Real?' ” said the Velveteen Rabbit.  “Being Real is the best,"" said Cowboy Horse.  ""You can move when you want. When you are Real, if you are loved you can show love back.”      Part 2: Chosen! One day Nana, who took care of the Boy, flew open the lid of the toy box.  She said in a busy tone, “Oh, dear!  That walking doggie is missing. I must find something else for the Boy!”  In a second, the Velveteen Rabbit was plopped down onto the bed with the Boy.  This began another happy time for Velveteen Rabbit.  Each night the Boy would hold the Velveteen Rabbit close in his arms.  In the morning, the Boy would show the Velveteen Rabbit how to make rabbit holes under the sheets.  If the Boy went outside to a picnic or to the park, the Velveteen Rabbit would come with him.    This began another happy time for Velveteen Rabbit.  After all that hugging and holding, much of the Velveteen Rabbit’s fur got matted down.  Its pink nose grew less pink, but the Velveteen Rabbit did not care.  It was happy.  One day the Boy became sick.  His forehead got very hot.  The doctor came and went, and Nana walked back and forth in fear.  Day after day, the Boy stayed in bed.   There was nothing for Velveteen Rabbit to do but to stay in bed too, day after day.    Velveteen Rabbit Then at last, the Boy got better.  Such joy in the house! The doctor said the Boy must go to the shore.  How wonderful! thought Velveteen Rabbit.  Many times the Boy had talked with great excitement about the shore, about its wide sandy shore and big blue ocean.    “What about this old bunny?” Nana asked the doctor.  ""What about this old bunny?"" Nana asked the doctor.  “That old thing?” said the doctor.  “It’s full of scarlet fever germs.  Burn it at once!  Get him a new bunny.”  The Velveteen Rabbit was thrown into a sack along with the Boy's bed sheets and old clothes and a lot of junk.  The sack was carried to the backyard.  The gardener was told to burn the whole thing.  But the gardener was too busy picking the beans and peas before nightfall, so he left the sack behind.  “I will take care of it tomorrow,” he said.  The sack was not tied at the top, and the Velveteen Rabbit fell out.    Velveteen Rabbit       Part 3: A Tiny Fairy The next day when the gardener picked up the sack to take it away to be burned, the Velveteen Rabbit was not in it.  Then it started to rain.  The Velveteen Rabbit felt sad - so far away from the Boy, never again to be nice and cozy inside together and now soaking wet, too!  A tear fell from Velveteen Rabbit’s eye, over his cheek.  It plopped onto the grass.  All at once, at the spot where the tear fell, a flower grew up.  The bud of the flower opened.  Inside was a tiny Fairy!  Velveteen Rabbit “Little Rabbit,” said the Fairy.  “Do you know who I am?”  “Should I know you?” said the Velveteen Rabbit.  “I'm the Fairy that takes care of toys that are well loved,” said the Fairy.    By then, the Velveteen Rabbit was shabby and frayed.  The boy had loved off all of its whiskers.  The pink lining in the ears had worn into a light grey. Its dark brown spots, once fresh and bright, were now faded and hard to see.  “It is time for me to make you Real,” said the Fairy.    ""It is time for me to make you Real,"" said the Fairy.  “I think I remember Real,” said Velveteen Rabbit.  What was it that Cowboy Horse had said?  Ah, yes!  When you are Real, you move when you want to move.  If you are loved, you can love back.  With one touch of the Fairy’s wand, the Velveteen Rabbit felt different.  Tickly.  All of a sudden, its two legs that had always been sewn together tight, could move apart!    A fly landed on Velveteen Rabbit’s head.  It was itchy and as quick as a wink, that foot was up at the Velveteen Rabbit’s head to shake it away.    “So this is being Real! I can move when I want to move!”  “I will show you some new friends,” said the Fairy.  And the Fairy took the Velveteen Rabbit to where several rabbits ran and hopped about.  Soon they were all great friends.  Time went by.  The Boy came back from the shore, all better now.      Part 4: Together Again One day, the Boy went to the backyard to play.  From the trees nearby, a few rabbits hopped out.  One rabbit was brown all over, and another one was all white.  A third rabbit was brown with spots that were still darker brown, though most of them faded.  That rabbit hopped up close to the Boy.  Velveteen Rabbit The Boy thought, ""Why, this rabbit looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I was sick.  I loved that Bunny!""  What he didn't know was this was his very own Bunny, come back to see the boy. For he was the reason the Velveteen Rabbit had become Real."
