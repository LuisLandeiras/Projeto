Human biology encompasses the study of the human body's structure and function. The human skeleton provides support, protects organs, and anchors muscles. Red blood cells in the human body transport oxygen from the lungs to tissues. The brain, part of the central nervous system, controls bodily functions and processes information. The heart pumps blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients. Neurons transmit electrical signals to and from the brain and spinal cord. The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that the body can absorb.

Human skin acts as a barrier to protect internal organs from environmental damage. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and regulate water balance. Muscles contract and relax to enable movement and maintain posture. The immune system defends against pathogens and foreign invaders. DNA, found in the nucleus of cells, carries genetic information. Hormones, produced by endocrine glands, regulate various body functions. The respiratory system facilitates the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Human vision is made possible by the eyes, which detect light and send signals to the brain. Bones contain marrow, which produces blood cells. The liver detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs. Human growth is driven by the production and release of growth hormones. The reproductive system allows humans to produce offspring. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, and light. The pancreas regulates blood sugar levels by producing insulin.

Teeth are essential for breaking down food in the digestive process. Hair and nails are made of a protein called keratin. The lymphatic system helps maintain fluid balance and defend against infections. Human ears detect sound waves and play a role in maintaining balance. Sweat glands help regulate body temperature through perspiration. The large intestine absorbs water and forms solid waste. The hypothalamus in the brain regulates hunger, thirst, and body temperature.

Cartilage cushions joints and allows for smooth movement. Adipose tissue stores energy in the form of fat. The esophagus transports food from the mouth to the stomach. White blood cells are crucial for fighting infections. The thyroid gland regulates metabolism through hormone secretion. Human hands have opposable thumbs, enabling precise grip and manipulation. Platelets are involved in blood clotting to prevent excessive bleeding.

The spleen filters blood and helps fight infections. The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption. The human body maintains homeostasis through various feedback mechanisms. Taste buds on the tongue detect different flavors. Human cells undergo mitosis to reproduce and repair tissues. The cerebrum is responsible for higher brain functions like thinking and memory. Blood plasma is the liquid component of blood, carrying cells and nutrients.

The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary functions such as heartbeat and digestion. The retina in the eye converts light into neural signals for vision. Human bones are composed of a matrix of collagen and calcium phosphate. The pituitary gland, often called the "master gland," regulates other endocrine glands. Connective tissues support and bind other tissues in the body. The vocal cords in the larynx produce sound for speech.

Human lungs contain alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. The medulla oblongata controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate. The human body has approximately 206 bones. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions in the body. The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin. The urinary bladder stores urine before it is excreted. The human genome consists of approximately 20,000-25,000 genes. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body.

Human cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane that regulates what enters and leaves. The sternum, or breastbone, protects the heart and lungs. Synapses are the junctions where neurons communicate with each other. The corpus callosum connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.
