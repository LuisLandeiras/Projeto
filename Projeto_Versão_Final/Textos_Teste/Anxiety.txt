In the quiet solitude of her small apartment, Sarah battled a relentless adversary that most people couldn't see—a debilitating anxiety that consumed her thoughts and dictated her every move. To the outside world, Sarah appeared timid and withdrawn, her once bright eyes dulled by the weight of constant worry. Yet, beneath her outward facade of composure, Sarah struggled daily with a tumultuous internal landscape that made even the simplest tasks feel insurmountable.

Mornings dawned with a sense of dread for Sarah. The soft light filtering through her curtains was a reminder of another day fraught with uncertainty and fear. Simple decisions—what to wear, what to eat—became overwhelming as her mind raced with catastrophic scenarios and irrational fears. Each step outside her apartment felt like navigating a minefield of potential triggers, each interaction with strangers a battle against the suffocating grip of panic.

In social settings, Sarah felt like an outsider looking in.

Even in the sanctuary of her home, Sarah found no respite from her anxiety.
