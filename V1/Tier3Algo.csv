"can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

"            my good friend john robinson asked me an excellent question about a month ago, on the road to ohio: 'ben, are you voting  for  john kerry, or just  against  george bush?'  i replied, 'i'm voting against bush.  i don't know kerry, but i know bush.'   john, thank you for that question; but i've changed my mind as of last night.  i'm voting  for  kerry, now, and have volunteered to work for his campaign here in virginia.    We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com           ",7.382,7.367,7.783,0.578,0.515,68.059,16.167,0.033,0.834,0.133,9.878,11.07,4.31,2
"           The sunrise in Las Vegas is not like sunrise in the rest of the world. Which is quite fortunate for the rest of the world.   You see, for most of the world, sunrise is the most purposeful time of day. For most of the world, save for the poor souls working night shift, morning is get-at-it time. The first few lemon-yellow rays appear in the east, the twittering machine of birds starts up, lights click off as punctuation. They're all signals to get moving, to start a new day, to brew coffee and read the paper and embark on whatever rituals we've adopted in the dubious but crucial goal of getting from a prone position on a bed to an upright position in an office.   If you've been to Las Vegas, you know that sunrise is the one time of day Las Vegas looks completely out of synch with itself. Yes, if you look hard at the hotels along the Strip, you can still see signs that life exists in the way we'd expect it to in Vegas. Cab drivers are moving tourists out of the hotels, with the implicit promise they'll be moving more in later in the day. A few stragglers, presumably placing their faith in a law of averages that rewards their tenacity, are seated at slot machines in windowless and massive hotel lobby casinos. You can even see a few people who have taken it upon themselves to honor some unspoken code of Vegas, literally partying all night, retreating to their hotel rooms. Some of them even manage to not look bleary and shaky doing so.   For a city that prides itself on nightlife and makes its fortune on gambling and is awash in thousands upon thousands of electric lights, sunrise is a caesura more than an event. It's when Vegas is least like Vegas, and is more like any other decent-sized American city in which people struggle with their alarm clocks, fumble their way to consciousness, and fill the air with smog on their way from the house to the job.   Of course, to most of those who visit Vegas each year -- the literal millions of them -- they're not likely to see sunrise. This is probably one of the few times in their lives they not only get to sleep in, but feel they are expected to.   Even if you tell yourself you're merely in observation mode, and you're driving around Vegas at sunrise with the resolve to not get sucked in by Vegas's temptations (and the resultant smugness that comes with it), know that Vegas is aiming one of its sequined arrows at your heart. It knows you have a weakness -- that there is something base and carnal within you that cries out for fulfillment. The billboards will seek you out. There are seven deadly sins. If it's not a high-level vice like sex or gambling, maybe it's something on the order of hobnobbing with Klingons at the Hilton's  Star Trek: The Experience  or eating a sushi dinner.  At nightfall, Vegas truly becomes Vegas, blotter-thick with images that either find their way onto postcards or are judiciously airbrushed from postcards: the lights, the buffets, the rows of street urchins clicking their escort services ad cards in the hopes you will make eye contact with them (which pretty much dooms you to taking one, and you only make that mistake once), the come-hither enticement of rows of slot machines, and come to think of it, the slippery-voweled double entendre of 'loose slots.'  At nightfall, Vegas becomes the full manifestation of Vegas. Vegas the city becomes Vegas the archetype. At sunrise, Vegas is something else entirely, but it's still not nearly as dormant as the majority of its tourists are.  Vegas at sunrise, you see, is not resting. It's reloading.    I’m sure this is not a novel thesis, but it’s one that bears repeating and reinforcing, so we can better understand our nation’s love affair with Las Vegas – the love that makes the little desert outpost that is McCarran International Airport the eighth busiest airport in the world. Las Vegas, even without a major sports franchise [1], even though it is currently ranked between Louisville and Jacksonville as the 51st largest media market in the nation, is the ultimate American city. New York might have the history and the melting pot, Los Angeles may have the most fertile climate for rags-to-riches ascent, Washington D.C. is the seat of power, and a number of cities would lay claim to being the most representative of the current America or the new, burgeoning America, depending on what thesis on America circa 2004 you’re trying to forward. But nowhere is the drive to consume, defended to the death as the pursuit of happiness, more evident than in Las Vegas – which makes Las Vegas, to me at least, the ultimate American city.    Vegas is where countless Americans come to play, and though there's not the sense that you can find everything you want in Vegas, like there is New York, there's definitely the sense that you can have your pleasure sensors suitably sated and diverted by its range of offerings. Chances are, you're not going to find that obscure album you've been scouring the bins of your mid-American record stores for in Las Vegas, but that same desire to be entertained will be filled by a stage show which will attempt to justify its ticket price in a sheer display of over-the-topness.   Go down the list of the fancier Strip hotels, and you can tick down the fantasy locations of a broad cross-section of Americans, depositing them in their choice of comfortable, dangerless recreations of where they'd most like to be. The Paris, the Monte Carlo, and the Venetian all conjure up images of a well-to-do, come-on-in-Americans version of Europe which may not be so welcoming in the George W. Bush era. The Mirage is a mélange of tropical settings which, through a name suggesting the windows of the imagination, isn't bound by any sort of geographical assignation whatsoever. The Excalibur, Caesars Palace and the Luxor opt for taking the guest back to a time in which their setting was the most desirous location to the people of that epoch -- certainly similar to how Americans view the United States of today. The Bellagio, though it hints at an Italian theme, seems to shoot for an aesthetic based on pure wealth.   If you look closely at the signs in front of what will become Wynn's, the newest and shiniest of the Strip hotels, you can see construction permit signs that read 'La Reve.' According to the Vegas native who served as my de facto tour guide for my last trip to the city, La Reve was too obscure and too hard to pronounce for most everyone, so developer Steve Wynn, the force behind Bellagio, Mirage, and Treasure Island, in a move hinting at both frustration with our plebeian ways and a Napoleonic ego, slapped his own name on the project and left it at that.   Steve Wynn is responsible for maybe my favorite juxtaposition of highbrow and lowbrow in the city -- the Wynn Collection. The museum, on the site of the former Desert Inn, features a dozen or so works by the likes of Picasso[2], Gauguin, and Matisse. You'd know this, even if you weren't an art aficionado, because the jumbotronic LED sign out front, which looks like it wouldn't be at all out of place fronting a suburban strip mall, scrolls through a series of messages:  Works by Pablo Picasso (flash, flash) Paul Gauguin (flash, flash) Henri Matisse (flash, flash)   Here, on a giant tacky sign on a street resplendent with giant tacky signs, in a city resplendent with giant tacky signs that all ache to be giant tacky signs with Las Vegas Boulevard addresses, some of the most admired painters of the 20th Century are relegated to the same mode of advertising as $5.99 dinner specials and 'loose slots.' The sign would not look out of place at the aptly-named Terrible's Casino, as a matter of fact.  But the giant sign reminds you that it is, in fact, Steve Wynn's ragingly expensive art collection housed here, and even though the gallery exterior is slight on ambience, he does lord over works by some of the undisputed masters of 20th Century Art. And you're not likely to forget it. After all, Wynn Collection.  If you're in the mood for more aptly-curated, ragingly expensive art, you can wander over to the Venetian, walk under its very pink, very garish, very frescoed and not-quite-authentic-looking ceilings, and go to the Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, which boasts collections that wouldn't at all be out of place at the Whitney or MOMA. And then, in the spirit of having it all, you can walk for three minutes and plop down at a Wheel of Fortune slot machine, letting the lights and the hysteria and the promise of a magic, jingly pull suck you in.   --  It wasn’t always like this, of course. Las Vegas was connected to railway by 1905, and what became known as Glitter Gulch, the downtown enclave of casinos now firmly entrenched as the Strip’s tacky, embarrassing older brother, sprang up in the following decades. The hotel-casino concept started in Las Vegas with the Rancho El Vegas in 1940. The Flamingo, the first of the Strip hotels still around today, opened in 1946. The Riviera was the first of the Strip high-rises, built in 1955. Before that, the relatively squat Desert Inn, with a third-floor “skyroom,” was considered the place to go for a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding valley. The Rancho El Vegas began booking stars in 1941 to begin entertaining guests, and topless showgirls made their debut in 1957. A century earlier, Mormons settled in the area, later abandoning their modest adobe homes due to Indian raids. There’s still a sizable Mormon population in Las Vegas, even though there may be no worse place on Earth to be Mormon. [3]  When I announced to acquaintances living in Vegas that I was writing an essay about Vegas as the ultimate American city, even though I was doing so online, I could see the dramatic eye rolling and hear the expelled sighs that accompanied their online responses. The message could be summed up to say, 'Here we go again,' and indeed, they want to point out something that was clearly evident from driving off the Strip and into its residential clusters -- Vegas is not a 24/7 party for most of its residents.  There are not showgirls hanging out on every corner waiting to do a lavish musical number when the light changes from red to green. They wanted to make clear that Vegas is full of normal people having normal lives, in the same way that people from Dallas want to clarify that not everyone in Dallas wears a cowboy hat and lives on a ranch, in much the same way that people from Detroit want to point out that not everyone in Detroit lives in crumbling tenements and get around by stealing other peoples' cars.  Indeed, if you drive east of the Strip, past the airport, for about 10 or 15 minutes, you pass Henderson and then go into the heart of Green Valley, a 13,000-acre master planned community that is as lush and green and SUV-compatible as any other upscale suburban enclave you can picture in your part of the country.  Its primarily tourist attraction is the Ethel M. Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, which is exactly as advertised. You can tour the chocolate factory in a brisk ten-minute walk, browse in the gift shop (where the tour ends up, naturally), and then stroll outside to the cactus garden on the grounds, which allows you to learn more about indigenous desert plants than you ever thought possible with a box of chocolate tucked under your arm.  Green Valley, perhaps more than anything else in Vegas, hints at a normalcy along the lines of, say, a suburb in Phoenix, which might be as staidly normal as America gets. But this being Vegas, the normalcy feels worn more than owned -- an Epcot version of normal, a normal that looks as thematic and carefully contrived as anything on the Strip.  There are, after all, slot machines in the grocery stores in Vegas, newspaper vending machines full of escort services publications lining arterials well off the Strip, and fanciful backdrops of the Strip skyline behind the anchors delivering the local news. Many of Vegas's residents want to be thought of as normal people living in a normal city, but there's only so much of a case you can make for it before you say, 'Yeah, but' and demand a local takes you to see Wayne Newton's house. Though some might refuse, others will invariably oblige, a little proud that they can lay claim to something that, while kitschy, is actually oddly iconic. [4]  Incidentally, the Wayne Newton house, which is really an estate called Shenandoah, is on that drive between the Strip and Green Valley at the corner of Sunset Road, a major east-west arterial connecting the Strip and the freeway to the eastern reaches of the Vegas Valley, and Pecos Road.   Shenandoah is in that uniquely conflicted realm between tasteful and tasteless that seems to be quintessentially Vegas and not really anything else. It wants to invoke the majesty of a Kentucky thoroughbred ranch, and at the same time, it wants its gilded golden gates and its placard-bearing public art.  To give you some indication of the sort of world we're in, Mike Tyson's house is about a block down Pecos, and it's infinitely more tasteful, the sort of house that gives me house envy (and my tastes run toward the clean and uncomplicated, just so you know). The only thing that even began to reveal the eccentricities of the owner inside was the rows of portable outdoor heaters along the walkways, strategically placed so Tyson could theoretically walk around the grounds of his house without experiencing a moment of cold; I can't say that's a particularly bad thing at all.   And we're not even in Vegas here -- we're in Henderson, where Vegas tries hardest to assert its normalcy, its just-like-youness, its anonymity. And yet, in this unassuming part of the metropolis, an instantly recognizable pop icon could call out 'Hi, neighbor' and wave to one of the most notorious public figures of the last quarter-century, and then go back into his walled estate in preparation for another night of entertaining tourists from all over the world in a theater that bears his name.   With me, at least, the 'we're just like you' argument isn't flying.   --  In a city where most of the tourist activity focuses on a single street, it's not surprising that so many of the Strip hotels want to control the vertical as well as the horizontal. The Bellagio has an elaborate series of motorized fountains in its massive pool fronting the Strip sidewalk. Every fifteen minutes, the Bellagio puts the fountains to work in a show marrying a song (could be Sinatra, could be Celine Dion, could be the National Anthem, could be anything emblematic and in broad brushstrokes really) with a synchronized dance of water jets. From across the street, at the Paris, one can see the show from the outdoor café terraces or from the air in the half-scale Eiffel Tower model.  The Stratosphere Tower, at 1,149 feet, is the tallest observation tower in the United States. Because it wouldn't be enough to have the tallest building in Vegas, the observation deck, at over 900 feet, boasts a roller coaster, a ride called the X Scream which basically dangles its riders over the side of the tower and then -- perversely -- stops there to let you peer at a potential death-by-falling, It also features a ride called the Big Shot which takes you 160 feet above the observation deck at a force of 4 Gs. It would seem that sadists got together to decide what attractions would be placed at the Stratosphere, though you can already see that someone in some marketing Gulag assigned to promote these rides would refer to fans of this sort of thing as 'ultimate thrill-seekers.'   And finally, the winner of the Sky Sweepstakes may be the Luxor -- built as a giant pyramid with a replica of the Sphinx of Gaza out front -- which projects a toxically-bright beam of light from its top triangular windows to the heavens once night falls. I'm no physics major, so I have no idea if there's a point where the light just dissipates to nothingness. I assume it does. Maybe it does go to infinity. I feel I should know this, and I feel like a failure for not being able to conclusively state where the Luxor's light stops. All that really matters from a Vegas standpoint, though, is it reaches higher than anything else on the Strip, and if you're out on the eastern edges of town, past the airport, toward the fringes of Ostensibly Just Like You-land, you can see it. It sure as hell reaches higher than the Stratosphere Tower does.   --  The hotels themselves, from personal experience and reports from other friends, shape up this way: opulent, grandiose lobbies that give way to hotel rooms with sumptuous bathtubs and views resplendent with neon streaking. Which sounds good, except Vegas hotels also tend toward bed-pillow ensembles that don't so much beckon you to sleep a languid sleep as they do forcibly recharge you for another day of gambling. They also fuel you in the form of in-house restaurants that carboload you to absurd levels of satiation for considerable prices. Cheap buffets can be found if you look hard enough, though it's clearly in the spirit of getting what you pay for.   Your idea of romance has to encompass an ability to laugh at kitsch together; fortunately, this works out quite well for my wife and me. But Vegas, at some point in the proceedings, would really rather have you peel off from one another, perch you side by side at slot machines, and let you have at it. After all, Vegas is not built on letting you hole up in a hotel room that can be had for as little as $79 a night.  There's also shopping to be had, with the two best examples being the Forum at Caesars Palace and the Grand Canal Shoppes (sic) in the Venetian Hotel.  The Forum, though it has a wide assortment of stores housed under a fake Roman setting complete with columns and a vast, ice-blue sky filled with puffy cumulus clouds, doesn't necessarily have to be walked through to get the full effect -- you can do that just as well by watching what might be the consummate Vegas movie,  Showgirls . There's a critical scene in which Elizabeth Berkley's Nomi Malone character bonds with Gina Gershon's Cristal Connors character while enjoying a ridiculously indulgent lunch at a 'patio' table on the Forum walkway, contrasting their good fortune with the particular brand of dog food they both favored in considerably leaner times, to make the rags-to-riches nature of their story just that much more blatant.   The movie casts Vegas as a sort of purgatory, and at the end of the movie, when Nomi leaves Vegas behind after committing a horrible-but-justified (in this setting, at least) crime, hitching a ride to Los Angeles, L.A. becomes cast as heaven. No, scratch that. Vegas is cast as sort of a reverse purgatory, where, once you've adequately blackened your soul, you are expelled into the bowels of hell -- here, Los Angeles in all its plastic, money-grubbing horror. The subtle undercurrent message of the movie (if such a thing can be said for the movie that put Joe Eszterhas on the map) is that Vegas is able to tart up the grit enough to keep it from being a Boschian landscape of soot-encrusted hard luck stories. The Forum at Caesars Palace is one of these freshly-painted tableaus hoisted up to hide the treachery and inevitable fall from grace that L.A. is notorious for. But then again, I'm not a big L.A. fan.  The Grand Canal Shoppes, on the other hand, demand to be walked through -- or better yet, demand to be journeyed through in a gondola steered by some minimum-wage lackey in a festive striped shirt, to get the full effect. Yet there is one on-screen moment that allows one to get the sense of the onslaught that is the GCS without actually setting foot (or splashing down) inside it.   Through some odd coincidence in which televisual life synchs up with your lived life, my wife and I saw the Regis Galerie segment of the Michael Jackson BBC special only several hours after walking though the real Regis Galerie ourselves. If you recall, there's a scene in which Jackson takes now-notorious documentarian Martin Bashir through Regis Galerie. Jackson proclaims the store, located in the Grand Canal Shoppes, as his favorite place to shop.   Regis Galerie specializes in Hideous and Overpriced Art -- a lot of bronze, a lot of splashy paintings -- the type of place where they don't mind throwing around terms like 'giclees.' You do not want to break anything in this store, and unless you tend toward the gem-encrusted or the ornate, you probably do not want to buy anything in this store. It's like Versailles without the necessary spacing -- everything is clumped together in rows, with aisles far too narrow to be reasonably sure you won't catch your foot on the corner of something that will cost you $10,000 in a dangerous game of You Break, You Buy.   You can see why Michael Jackson would like a place like this. Remember, this is a man who tends toward sequins and gold trim and get-ups that make him look like a general in the Army of Oz. Even with his current legal troubles, he still strikes me as the celebrity most likely to wear a crown in public. So I can't imagine why he wouldn't find Regis Galerie attractive.   Is it too reductive to reduce the entire shopping complex into what might arguably be its most narrowly specialized store? Perhaps. Yet when it comes to crystallizing the horrors of more-money-than-taste that can be had at the GCS, I keep flashing back to that scene in the Bashir movie, brilliant in its ability to catch Michael Jackson in a swoon over art that, despite its hundreds of hours to make and thousands of dollars to buy, would set any good normal American, even those who make the pilgrimage to Vegas to nibble from Eve's apple, into icy recoil.  --   Of course, there's a whole other route to excess in Vegas that doesn't require a continual hemorrhaging of money, but rather, one hefty payment upfront, and that's the Vegas show. The stage shows, as you might expect, are elaborate affairs that try to dazzle and overwhelm. Any attempt to connect on an earnest level seem doomed for failure, though Rita Rudner has carved out a niche for herself at New York New York that I imagine few could have predicted. Celine Dion, on the other hand, was probably on a trajectory for her own Vegas show from the time her emotive-yet-manly flexing moves entered her onstage repertoire.   With Siegfried and Roy on permanent hiatus, an impressionist/singer named Danny Gans (who shared face time with S&R in Mirage's full-court-press billboard campaign) is now ruling the Mirage [5], and the Amazing Jonathan, who appears to be a rougher, more plebian version of Gans, features at the Flamingo. You can, reductively, still group most of the Vegas show set into three categories: B and C-List Stars In Freefall, Multi-Taskers You've Never Heard Of, and Elaborate Stage Shows With Complete Unknowns (Featuring Breasts). But then you have to also figure in Cirque de Soleil, and that has completely changed the landscape of Strip hotel entertainment, thank God.   Currently, Cirque de Soleil is ruling the roost in Vegas, show-wise, and that's really not a bad thing. There are three official CdS shows currently running --  Mystere , at Treasure Island, which appears to be the most run-of-the-mill of the three;  Zumanity , at New York New York, which is adult and racy and apparently so pointedly ribald that Paris Hilton walked out on it, according to Local Tour Guide after one of the troupe members pointed to her table and said, 'Here's where all the prostitutes sit;' and  O , at the Bellagio, which is of such a startling scale that it probably merits an essay all to itself.  Cirque de Soleil does not translate to TV, although the Bravo cable channel certainly tries by airing CdS specials whenever it's not airing  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . This is especially true of  O , a show involving 81 performers, a deluxe theater at the Bellagio with a 1.5 million gallon tank of water with moving sections of floor, constantly shifting from pool to stage to stage with sections of pool. The whole show is stunning, and given that our tickets were $150 each (when my wife and I went), it's a good thing that it is so stunning. Even the opening unfurling of the curtain is orchestrated to be stunning. There are some vague themes and emotional tones in the piece, but if you broke it down and analyzed it, I think you would only make yourself sick, so really you should just watch it and enjoy it for the eye candy it is. And at the risk of sounding like a bourgeois consumer that can't quite make it to highbrow, you need to see this show when you're in Vegas -- yes, you, dear reader -- than for no other reason but to have this remain at one end of your theater spectrum. For the other, you should see a single actor perform Wallace Shawn's  The Fever . Those are probably the most extreme theater poles you could seek out. [6]  Of course, you don't have to spend a Benjamin or more to see Vegas at its most over-the-topability. If you're going to see one schlocky, free piece-of-crap production, I heartily suggest  The Sirens of TI , an elaborate 20-minute stage show designed for public consumption (sort of) which also doubled as the opening PR gambit in Treasure Island's transformation into TI.  Back when Treasure Island was Treasure Island, they'd do a show out in front of the hotel where the pirate ship sinks the British ship. The show was predictably thematic, full of yo-ho-hoing and appropriately festooned with skull-and-crossbone flags and eyepatches. Treasure Island is now -- avast! -- trying to remake itself into something younger and sultrier, in order to compete with the other hotels. Ergo, TI. But unfortunately for them, the TI logo has arrived on its giant light-up sign out front looking vaguely like the opening card on a children's video, and the calling card for TI has turned into a show that strives to be, above all else, babelicious.   There's still a pirate ship in  The Sirens of TI , but it's placed in more of an adversarial role. Indeed, the show is essentially a chance to get away with as many clumsy sexual allusions as possible and sink a boat in the process. We start with voice over announcing that it's the 69th day at sea for the pirates (see, not subtle), and a cabin boy alights upon the deck of the Sirens' boat. The Sirens establish themselves early on, through dancing and costumes in the opening number, for lack of a better term, as hotties.  They establish their characters, and the character of the show, early on. The leader of the Sirens, Cinnamon, asserts that you can call her 'Cin' (wink, nudge), and makes it a point to inform the audience about all the 'seamen' she's brought into her 'cove.' (I wish I were kidding.)  It goes on from there to feature babe dancing, the emergence of the pirate ship, babe boasting, babe dancing, some pyrotechnics, the sinking of the pirate boat, and pirates boarding the deck of the siren boat for pornographic cavorting about. The music's horrible, too -- a collision of rock and schlock, truly outrageous in the cartoonish way that Jem (obscure '80s reference) was truly, truly outrageous.    It's as if the producers said, 'Okay, here's a concept: let's make a show that's reeaaaally bad ... but we'll say it's good!' Clearly, though, there's something great about the show, if I can give you a cursory 'Go see  O ' without describing a single scene, and yet painstakingly break down the  Sirens  show plot point by plot point. What's great about  Sirens  is this: people stay through the whole thing. Stunningly, some video tape it. As in record. The whole thing. I joked to my wife, in the post-show, shaking-our-heads analysis, that if I was recording it, I'd be a few minutes into it and go, 'Ohhh, okay ... never mind,' and pull the camera down.  But not these people. They were  dutifully  filming the whole thing. You would think that's nothing special, since, you know, Vegas, tourist, videocameras. Yet this phenomenon is rarer than you'd think in Vegas. I didn't see a lot of the compulsive videotaping people you'd expect at other tourist destinations.  I'm guessing that, other than the fact that a spinning slot machine doesn't translate well to the small screen, especially if it's spinning for several hours at a stretch, it's because people are indulging in behaviors they might not want recorded. The new motto for Vegas (this is the official motto, mind you, from their CVB) is 'What Happens Here, Stays Here.' By that line of reasoning, if you record it, it goes with you.  And I think, really, Vegas resists recording. It has to be experiential. You can't adequately film the adrenaline roller coaster that accompanies slot machine reverie or blackjack gaming or the tense, sinister-looking game called Pai Gow Poker, which involves some cryptic mix of cards and dominos, played by some of the most focused people in the casino, who also happen to be the people who look most like bit players in Bond movies.  And I'm pretty sure you can't just take a video camera into one of the many strip clubs in Vegas, speaking of what happens here stays here. Someone was telling me there's something like 28 strip clubs in Vegas, and though I don't know it empirically, I'm willing to guess that there's a whole other archetype in Vegas -- namely, the archetype that sports radio talk show host Jim Rome likes to call the This Stripper Really Likes Me Guy.  During my last stay in Las Vegas, there was a news story about a hearing involving Dennis Rodman, who got a DUI for wrecking a motorcycle in front of a strip club called Treasures. I saw enough billboards and alt-weeklies and heard enough sports talk radio during the trip to get a sense that the This Stripper Really Likes Me Guy is well taken care of in Vegas.   Again, it makes sense -- a sort of deductive reasoning sense -- in Vegas. In our society, sex is still largely in the realm of the forbidden, and strip clubs effectively make sex commerce, put a price tag on human contact, and in the relatively brief interchanges in which dancers and customers, meet, talk, carve out what appears to be a temporary, mutual semblance of love, and consummate the illusion via lapdance, the feeling like love becomes a commodity itself. And then, with relative tidiness, the dancer moves on to create similar connections with other customers, and the customer can walk out of the establishment and back to his life again, wearing the cloak of anonymity most of us wear.  (Or, if you're not anonymous, like Dennis Rodman is not, you can just wreck your motorcycle in front of the strip club and add to your already inflated and even tired bad-boy lore with maximum effectiveness, for what in our culture says bad boy more than hangs out at strip clubs, sports tattoos, and rides a motorcycle?)   The strip club makes sense in Vegas, more so than it does in Oklahoma City or Indianapolis, or in my hometown of San Antonio, which has recently passed a new set of rules banning dancer-customer contact as part of a moralist campaign that has also placed new regulations on one of the other permissible evils of our day and age: smoking. San Antonio isn't alone in setting up special rules around strip clubs, and in any other American city but Vegas, rules set up to regulate strip clubs is not a particularly shocking development.   But Vegas reasons that there's nothing wrong with it. In a world where everything is reduced to crass commerce, why not the courtship ritual and a grinding intimacy, too? I imagine, that if our technology ever produces a marketable, consumable virtual sex arcade, Vegas will become the place to test drive it. Like the indoor skydiving room just off the Strip, like the jousting tournaments at Excalibur, like the close encounters with Klingons at the Hilton's  Star Trek: The Experience , Vegas wants to take what might reside in the more fantasy-laden realms of your imagination and vivify them into glaring Technicolor reality. Not even decorum need be an obstacle, the 28 gentlemen's establishments of Vegas seem to tell you in one throaty voice, as long as you create a culture of permission. After all, as even the CVB tells you, what happens here, stays here.  --  But Vegas is not just a magnet for degenerates looking to escape their lives, to exchange their gritty existences for elaborate fantasies. I would say that a majority of the millions of tourists who come through each year are here to, mechanically and with purpose, play games of chance in the hopes of making money. And so, we can't really talk about Vegas without mentioning the Octogenerian Slot Machine Players.  They're an archetype unto themselves, and as with other Vegas archetypes, they only become archetypical in the rarefied air of Vegas. In their normal, day-to-day lives, they're pleasant, retired people, many of them fussing over grandchildren and living humble but comfortable lives on savings accumulated through years of hard work, aided by buying into a real estate market more conducive to creating a nest egg and building for one's future than today's double-income, debt-happy economy. My septuagenarian in-laws are perhaps the prototype for this brand of Vegas tourist. [7]  Several times a year, something stirs within the souls of the OSMPs, they make the pilgrimage to Vegas, collect a bucket with quarters (or, for the ultra-spendthrifty, nickels), find a favorable machine, and pull away. Some slot machines don't even have levers anymore -- you just push a button and watch yourself lose money/win money/break even, for hours at a stretch. Some smoke. Some drink. All achieve a glassy reverie at some point in the proceedings. Eventually, they return home, doing helpful things on the plane ride home like waking up Your Correspondent to see if he wants anything from the stewardess, even though he's clearly asleep, even though there's nothing in his slumping, snoring figure to suggest he thirsts.   Whereas there's a certain level of intimidation to the games of chance controlled by a hotel employee -- perhaps reminiscent of hollow-eyed carneys who preside over carnival midway games you know are stacked against you -- there's something about the rows of slot machines that are inviting by contrast. By telling someone to deal you in, or that you want to put a chip down on your lucky number in roulette, or that you want a turn at the dice, you're having to admit to another person (no matter how professional a countenance or no matter how neutral an expression that person is able to maintain) that you gamble.   Though your inner devil might say, 'Of course you do, you're in Vegas, that's what you're here for,' your inner angel might feed you full of Puritan messages about the evils of gambling. Vocalizing your desire to gamble to another human being, even one in the employ of a casino, might be enough to push that debate front and center.   But slot machines don't talk. They don't have to fight to maintain a poker face whenever you do something brilliant or do something stupid at one of the tables. They don't remind you of your pastor back home. They just sit there, rows and rows of them, with the latent promise that one of them is going to deliver.  Despite being set to randomly deliver jackpots at unpredictable intervals, OSMPs like my mother-in-law will claim there's a system to playing the slots. My father-in-law goes as far as to talk about how playing the slots successfully is 'a lot of work.' I tend to believe him, and because he's the type of man who will look forward to his home improvement projects and stretch them out over multiple days, puttering and fussing under the guise of 'getting things just right' in order to make them last and even savor them, I think that he probably actually enjoys the 'hard work' of playing slots.   So they work. They scout out machines that have been recently abandoned by players who spent interminable amounts of time pulling or pushing with no results. They themselves sit for hours, mechanically feeding coins into the face of the machine, hoping for the release of coins that you would hope could fend off orgasm metaphors yet really can't, especially when you see a jackpot winner's reaction, an outpouring of joy that derails a personal sense of modesty en route to unfiltered bliss.   Of course, it's not all work -- as I said earlier, some drink, which is a simple way of saying that gambling and drinking are helplessly intertwined. That's another reason I believe slot machines are so popular -- it dawns on you at some point in the proceedings at the blackjack table or the poker table or even the roulette wheel that alcohol may cloud your judgment and cause you to lose more money that you would while sober. But in front of the slot machine, you're not losing more money with every pull so much as you're investing the time necessary to work the law of averages to your advantage and win that money back. And then some.   Clearly, though, the mission of Vegas is to get you to drink while gambling -- hence, the scantily-clad cocktail waitress, who in most of the hotels look decidedly like a paean to a dying age: the Playboy Club Epoch. Though seemingly engineered to salve the various hurts of middle-aged men, the costumes, I think that maybe, perversely, the Greatest Generation set, now spending their golden years on Vegas vacations, might be the real target of the scantily-clad cocktail waitress outfit.  You see, the outfit is evoking the nostalgia of a bygone era, and by wearing the outfit as rendered during the time where today's septuagenarians and octogenarians were first middle-aged men in need of spiritual/sexual balm, it's reflecting that reassuring reminder of 'the way things used to be, back when they were good.' Note, though, that is still has the same effect on a certain percentage of today's middle-agers. For today's hipper, snottier generations, it has a different appeal, predicated on the same kind of anti-cool cool that explains a predilection toward trucker caps and Pabst Blue Ribbon.   In any case, it's not so much what the cocktail waitress is or isn't wearing, but rather, what they're parading around on their trays.   Alcohol is pretty much inescapable in Vegas. Though it's not quite a situation where you're handed a drink as you get off the plane [8], drinks can be had pretty much anywhere you please. On our recent trip, we went up to the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris, a half-scale model of the real thing that allowed you to, among other sightseeing endeavors, see the Bellagio fountain show from overhead. One fellow tourist glibly noted, to whoever would hear him, that this was the only place in Vegas without a bar attached to it. In other words, pretty much everyone notices there's a lot to drink.  This brings me to another of my favorite Vegas archetypes, the I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy, who is either carrying a can of crappy domestic beer from a second-rate hotel for $1 or is carrying a large drink in a tall souvenir receptacle. [9] I saw at least three plastic Eiffel Towers being consumed on my walks up and down the Strip, and saw none in my two nights inside the Paris. Why not? The only reasonable explanation is that I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy migrates. Any chump can drink from a sitting position -- it takes the professional acumen of I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy to drink while walking. Besides, it's no fun to advertise that you've actually been inside the Paris while sitting in the middle of the Paris. It's better to let the throngs gathered on LVB know where you've stayed. [10]  The funny thing is, you don't have to have that level of professional drinking acumen to pick up your drink and walk. The latent permissiveness of Vegas allows unsuspecting candidates to walk around brandishing a drink like a trophy. It's a way of saying to the world, 'I work hard and fit in the vast majority of my life; I've earned this moment of unbridled hedonism.' And, in our world, by safe and conservative middle-American rules, this is just the kind of thing that passes for unbridled hedonism. We're perfectly willing to let this slide under these circumstances. We even welcome it. None of us have probably ever witnessed the amiable drunk at a party actually don a lampshade and start dancing, but if one did, we would recognize the trope, and we would laugh about it (provided, of course, that we took his keys and called him a cab at the end of the night).  What the Vegas pilgrims have done, essentially, is made this former little desert outpost a place to absorb and hold an ever-increasing number of mildly transgressive behaviors. It's no accident, for instance, that the Las Vegas season of MTV's seminal reality show  The Real World  was a running soap opera of sex, bad choices and aberrant behavior, all set against the tableau of the Palms, an off-Strip casino which has become the home base of choice for twentysomething enfants terribles.  Forget, for a moment, that the show was later surpassed in sex and sordidness by the cast of  Real World San Diego  -- they merely had to answer the call put forth by the Vegas cast. [11] And it was Vegas itself that incited the cast to riot, to such ludicrous extremes that Trishelle Cannatella, the central figure of the RW Vegas season, became something of a professional reality show cast member, later assigned to drink on camera and titillate fellow cast member Ron Jeremy on the WB's aptly-named  Surreal Life . Trishelle, as you might expect, morphed into such a quasi-celebrity that she never donned her last name for her subsequent reality show appearances. She became a mononym, a sure sign as any of disposable pop icon status.   --  Though  Real World Las Vegas  is a prime indication of how Vegas is trying to market to a new generation of people with a healthy disposable income, the Vegas metro area is no longer merely a nice place to visit.  Between 1990 and 2000, the largest metro area growth in the nation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was easily Las Vegas. Its population spiked an incredible 83% percent in that ten-year period; the next biggest jump was Naples, Florida, with 65%, and Yuma, Ariz., at just under 50%. This is not just a one-time spike. Since 1960, Vegas has grown from just under 140,000 people to its current 1.5 million plus, at astounding growth intervals. The population more than doubled in the 1960s and has been above 60% growth in each subsequent decade.   And the people just keep coming. The city's official site claims that the Vegas Valley could reach the two million mark by next year. Last month, the  Las Vegas Sun  reported that another million people are expected to be added to the city's rolls in the next two decades. The article glosses over why this growth is continuing, instead focusing on some of the concerns a massive growth explosion brings to the metropolis, such as the hard-to-overlook fact that Las Vegas sits in the middle of a desert, and that might make water a contentious issue as more people flock to the city to take advantage of what gets euphemized as 'favorable business conditions.'   What I can surmise, after trolling business development agency websites and various newspaper articles, is that Vegas is a great place to do business because the burden of taxation in Clark County falls largely on the millions of tourists who come through McCarran each year. The weather is nice. You're never at a loss for how to entertain your clients, and though you may grow weary of it, and mutter to yourself, 'Yeah, yeah, Wayne Newton's house' as you drive first-timers past Shenandoah yet again, there's always someone who's going to be wide-eyed and appreciative, who will actually be impressed that he Lives Among Us, that you are so seemingly well-connected.   At the risk of being reductive yet again, businessmen like sun, they like golf, and they like being able to get a drink after work. Ergo, Las Vegas. And while the tourism industry remains the major engine driving Clark County (and by extension, Nevada, since Clark Country makes up a good 70 percent of the state population), there are people living in Vegas that have nothing to do, occupation-wise, with the hotels and the hordes of tourist who come to Vegas each year seeking several days' escape from the rules that normally corral them into stagnant routine.   And you can tell that even at sunrise: a desert sunrise in the first week of Advent in the Christian calendar, where the air is tingly with cold -- where it is crisp, invigorating, all those things you say about a cold that you welcome, a cold you want to believe was delivered to your vacation destination expressly for your enjoyment. You can look around and notice subtle hints of Christmas if you try, but it's different from other cities, where the march toward Christmas is relentless, where wreaths and ads and glad tidings come in battalions.  At sunrise, in the outer reaches of North Las Vegas, of Henderson, of picture-perfect Green Valley, in the parts of Vegas that don't look like our postcard-ready images of Vegas, it's showers and cereal as part of this complete, nutritious breakfast and commutes to work. But on the Strip, where the nerve endings of Vegas crackle and sing, there's a temporary stillness that seems unnervingly quiet and disarmingly out-of-character. The jingling and whirring in the hotel lobby casinos is at an off-kilter staccato, and hotel employees see it fit to break out vacuum cleaners and bottles of cleaning solutions.   In hours, these places will be readily transformed again, with people from Iowa, from Massachusetts, from Europe and Japan. Throughout the lobby, in enough myriad languages to remind you that this is now, for all intents and purposes, an international city, it will essentially be the same message. It will be tourists, the lifeblood of the city with all that that entails, here for the express purpose of shedding their inhibitions for a few precious days, trying to figure out which compulsory layer they'd like to peel off first.   ###  Footnotes:   [1] The closest thing to a major professional sports team in Vegas is the Las Vegas 51s, a Triple-A baseball franchise which used to have the more mundane moniker of the Las Vegas Stars. The 51s is a play on Area 51, the rumored military-controlled alien research center. The team's mascot is one of those almond-headed, big-eyed alien prototypes, which, in a shocking development for new parents, is precisely what your child looks like through the ultrasound at three months -- pretty much the first time you can actually view what looks like a face.   [2] Wynn owns a Picasso piece named 'La Reve,' incidentally.   [3] The above historical information comes from Las Vegas Online Entertainment Guide's history page, which delves much farther into the role of the casino and the Strip hotel in Vegas's development than the city's official site does, although the city's official site does note that Spainards traveling through the Vegas valley in the 1700s referred to the trip as a 'journey of death,' which can't be good for tourism even if it is historically accurate.  [4] Like my tour guide for the trip, a food stylist who hosts a nationally-syndicated radio show, moonlights as a UNLV instructor, and is clearly in a gustatory, golf-playing love with Vegas.  [5] That's not to suggest that Gans was in cahoots with that white tiger or anything.   [6] Okay, so maybe  now  I look highbrow.  [7] Though, actually, they can stave off the siren song of Vegas by going on a lower-rent version of the Vegas pilgrimage -- the Louisiana pilgrimage. Louisiana, which is also a den of sin, features casinos in a number of the towns (Lake Charles, Kinder, Bossier City) bordering Texas. Native American-run casinos, even closer than the Louisiana border, also serve as a sort of morphine to the heroin of Vegas. But, somehow, Vegas always beckons.   [8] A la the '70s ABC drama  Fantasy Island , which used the 'give the guests their Mai Tais' scene as a regular device, showing them happy and relaxed just before they started their fantasy vacations, which (like a Faustian bargain) had specific intents and aims that would always go horribly awry.  [9] Though you're actually more likely to see I Can't Believe They're Letting Me Drink On The Street Guy in New Orleans. Or, at least, you'll see him there more exuberantly.   [10] And, really, when all is said and done, and you factor in the breakfast buffet and the bathtubs and the relative calm in its casino, the Paris is a fine place to stay.   [11] No way do we let San Diego beat Las Vegas in anything.          ",14.856,8.949,13.782,0.602,0.504,50.632,30.533,0.037,0.874,0.089,12.422,20.58,4.531,2
"                                                                                                       Walking in Abundant life     Our life is but a vapor.  We are passing through this world to enter into eternity.  Eternity can be a scary thing especially if what it holds for us is uncertain.  Fear is usually fear of the unknown.  Fear can paralyze us and keep us from knowing joy, happiness and contentment with who we are and where we are in life.   Life is a gift and we believe as Christians that God is the giver of this life.  Some of us would further define God in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Bible outlines a plan that God has given us so that we can walk in Abundant Life.   Lets examine some of the scripture that shows us what the bible says about Life and Death.      John 10:9 'I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.   10 'The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.   11 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.   John 3:14 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15 'that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   John 4:14 'but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.'   John 5:24 'Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.   John 7:14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.   James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;  14 but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.  15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.   The bible is our guide to life.  The bible is our source of originality.  The bible is our authority with regards to the beginning and end of life.  The bible is our guide to living a life of abundance through Christ Jesus our Lord.  Some folks believe that our existence was an accident and that we have evolved from being a cave man to a higher form of life.    I believe that each of us belongs to a global community called humanity.  I believe that God created man and that we are to worship Him.  I believe that God created us to enjoy those things that He has provided us with.  God created us and provided us with everything that we need in order to have abundant life.  I believe that God defines what our needs are through the pages of our bible.   I also believe that we have gotten our needs and wants messed up and our life has gotten out of balance.  I also believe that the evil of this present world has drawn some of us out and separated us from our full potential as Christians.     In an effort to pursue God we have set up different religions and religious denominations with unique definitions of behavior and religious requirements that are necessary in order to find God and have abundant life.    What does life consist of on a personal level?    Eating Sleeping Emotions Thought life Sexual needs Intellect Physiology Religion Personal hygiene Entertainment Education Sports Hobbies Children Work Relationships Perceptions  As Christians we have entered into a personal relationship with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I am not speaking of an emotional guilt or reflex that causes us to behave religiously.  I am talking about our coming face to face with God of the universe because He revealed His plan for us through the reading of His word or by listening to His word being delivered to you through a sermon, bible study or personal testimony of another believer.  When we become Disciples of Christ we move from one relationship into another.  The bible says that we either serve the devil or we serve God.  We have allegiance to either one or the other.  We make a commitment to either one or the other.  We cannot serve God and Satan at the same time.  We have to make a choice that will have eternal circumstances.    Christianity is not a religious behavior but a way of life.  Our behavior does not define what Christianity is but our actions define how Christ has changed our lives from the inside out.   The difference between a religion vs. Christianity is a religion defines how we can become Holy enough to approach God while Christianity empowers us through the Holy Spirit to KNOW God on a personal basis and allows us to learn how to walk according to His will for our lives and our community.    Thanks to the Information Age we have more information available to us in real time than ever before.  Can you imagine that a world event sometimes took days, weeks or months to be reported to the rest of the global community?  Those were the days when we did not have tele-type, telephones, fax machines, computers, e-mail, satellite, pagers, or cellular communications.  How many of us know more about the bible and its doctrines than we know how to live our Christianity in a practical way?  Do we major in information gathering and minor in living the truth of Gods word?  Do we focus more on attending church, doing religious traditions, reading books about God, attend seminars than we do on learning how to live the life of a Christian?  If the answer were yes then I would believe that is the root cause for our failing to experience Abundant Life that Christ spoke of.    How many of us have the family bible sitting on our desk, end table or up on the shelf gathering dust?  The only time some of us open the bible is when the pastor or bible study teacher tells us to open it up and direct us to a chapter and verse.  Some of us treat our bibles just like we do the remote control for our TV sets.  We take out the remote from the package, put in fresh batteries and when we want to change the channel we punch the right buttons.  Has our Christianity turned into a series of bad commercials that we are frantically trying to flip through?  Are we hurriedly flipping through the abundant life that God has outlined in the pages of His word or are we taking time to absorb the information within the pages of His book?  We entered into a personal relationship with Christ, asked the Holy Spirit to enter into our hearts so we would have power on high and then we allow the cares of this world and the endless sin in our lives to drain the life right out of us.    If we do not feed our souls the word of God we will be like a ship without a rudder.  We will become like a ship without direction and no power.  The Holy Spirit within us will be quenched and stifled to the point that HE will be grieved.   The key to abundant life is a personal relationship with the God  (Jesus Christ) of our universe.  A relationship must be nourished and tended to on a daily basis.  If you are in a marriage relationship you understand how important it is to work at keeping that relationship healthy.  Relationships of all types require nurturing and that takes energy and focus.  Relationships take commitment and personal sacrifice.   The word of God, the power of prayer and the Holy Spirit and the people in Gods kingdom is what defines us as Christians.  Without those critical elements our faith would be powerless and useless.   The benefit of a relationship with Christ is abundant life, fulfillment and challenge.  God says in His word that He will write down our names in the Lambs book of Life and will allow us entrance to Heaven to worship Him for eternity.  We must choose to keep our commitment strong to which we are in the kingdom of God on a daily basis.   The bible says that we are to be in the world but not of the world.  Does that mean that we do not associate ourselves with people who do not subscribe to our faith in Christ?  Do we totally reject every single thing about our world and move into caves and become outcasts of society?  I believe that God wants us to be salt of the earth and the light of the world.  Our faith brings flavor and our life of integrity lights the way to the kingdom of God for all who will look.   Relationship evangelism is a key way in which we can get to know someone, show him or her that we care, live our life of faith in front of him or her without compromise and allow the power of the Holy Spirit to draw him or her to the kingdom.  We must learn how to love people and despise their sin.  We must despise their sin because we know that the consequences of sin is death.  We must learn how to show the love of God to people through mercy and compassion.   Chuck Swindoll stated in his book on Compassion that People do not care how much you know until you know how much you care.  Once upon a time I was zealous for God.  I was so zealous about telling people about the truth of Gods word that I sacrificed the love of God, compassion for people and mercy.  People need to know that God loves them.   People need to know that God is a God of love, mercy and compassion.  People need to know that God has given them a choice.  We must live our lives in such a way that people can clearly see their choices.    We must know HOW to LIVE out our faith in God in a real way for the world to see.  Our lives must be an open book so that our victories and defeats can reflect the power of God.  The following list will attempt to reflect some of our daily battles and some of our choices.     I recognize the benefits of growing in the knowledge of Gods word but I struggle in choosing to study Gods word.  I would rather watch TV or read a good book than study Gods word.   I want to be more like Christ in my thoughts and feelings but I find it difficult to get away from my old life habits and sin nature.  The old nature is too difficult to overcome sometimes.   I see a need to pursue God on a regular basis to grow our relationship but I tend to only seek Him when I am in trouble.   I find it difficult to make personal sacrifices that will benefit me in my Christian growth because it is so much easier to go along with the crowd.  My nature is to do what comes easiest to me instead of what is difficult.    I understand more about WHO God is to me but I am finding it difficult to translate His changes to me in a practical way.       I constantly find myself having to focus on my thought life and having to rebuke impure thoughts with regards to my fellow man.  I catch myself listening to others gossip and passing that information on through gossiping myself.    I have a problem with my temper and catch myself speaking sharply to my children or spouse.  I find myself sacrificing my relationships with people for the sake of pursuing personal wealth, status and power.   I find it difficult to reach out to others who are more needy than myself.  I catch myself focusing on my problems more often than not.  I find that it is easier to be critical of my pastor and the church I attend instead of taking the time to pray for the people and situations.   My addictions to food, sex, drink or drugs have robbed me of joy, peace and contentment.    As you can see this list could go on forever.  Now that we have scratched the surface with regards to some of the things that are affecting our ability to walk in abundant life lets look at some positive things that we can do in order to make wrong things right.  The problem with our lack of balance with regards to living out our faith is very similar to the problems that we have in our educational system of today.  Why are our schools releasing young people into society without the necessary skills that will enable them to be productive members of society?      A.Our children do not have a firm grasp on the fundamental basics, which include reading, writing and arithmetic.  Without the basic learning blocks how can we expect them to have the necessary skills for higher learning?  B.Our children attend battle zones for schools.  When we attended school our issues were talking in class and chewing gum and fist fights in the parking lot.  Our children have to endure an environment filled with violence because of drug abuse and kids carrying guns to school.    C.Our children are not receiving discipline at home and the school systems are forced to do what the parents are supposed to be doing to begin with.  How can teachers do what they are gifted to do when the children are not focused enough to do the work?  Living in an instantaneous society is not conducive to the kids taking the time to learn but would rather goof off and play.    D.Our children are subjected to teachers who are not committed to teaching.  It is hard to get an education when school systems are not willing to provide a work environment that rewards teachers for the sacrifices they make.  That drives teachers out of the classroom into other occupations that pay more.   Now lets look at how people have gotten out of balance with regards to experiencing Abundant Life that God has for us.    We have not learned the basics of our faith.    Scripture memorization, regular bible study and becoming knowledgeable about basic bible doctrine have left us weak and vulnerable to our enemy who is Satan.   The bible says this about our enemy.  Peter I 5:7 Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you.  8 Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour.  9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world.  10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.   We have forgotten that Satan is the enemy of God.  That means that YOU are the enemy of God.  Satan will drag you into the pits of Hell with him IF you allow yourself to be taken.  Satan is the great deceiver and has the ability to deceive people IF they are not preparing their minds with the truth of Gods word.  The bible says in the book of Hosea.   Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.   This is what the bible says about the IMPORTANCE of reading Gods word.   Hebrews 4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  Timothy II 2:14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.  15 Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.   We carelessly place ourselves in the middle of the minefields of life and wonder why we get our toes blown off.    We forget whom we belong to and we continue to act as if nothing has changed when we enter into a personal relationship with Christ.  We look to God as a puppet that we can manipulate when things go wrong but the rest of the time we leave Him on the shelf.  We entertain our minds and bodies with the cares of this world, which have no eternal meaning and lose out as we rush past the golden nuggets of a life filled with faithful obedience to Christ.  Our walk with Christ should be one of discipline, focus and diligence.   There is an old saying that says, Birds of a feather flock together.  We must learn how to associate ourselves with Kingdom Kids.  We need to seek out a good bible teaching church with people who are REAL about their relationship with God so that we can LEARN and GROW in our faith walk.  If we expect the power of God to be transferred into our lives and to give us REAL power so we can experience abundant life then we are going to have to place ourselves in the right environment for it to happen.    We run from discipline.    We live in an instant generation where we do not have to wait for anything.  We want it and we want it right now.  If you want something you do whatever you can to get it NOW.   Buy now and pay later is our motto.   In 2nd Corinthians we see the bible telling us therefore if any man be in Christ he is a NEW creation, old things pass away and all things become new.  We seem to think that our sinful nature is going to magically disappear and that we are going to completely and automatically bury our sin nature and that our NEW man (spirit man) is going to naturally spring forth.  We forget that there is a constant battle raging within our souls as the flesh competes with the power of the Holy Spirit that Christ places within us.  When we do something that we like we find out very quickly that we must discipline ourselves to learn HOW to get better at doing it.  If you like to bowl and you want to get better then you have to discipline yourself to learn HOW to approach the line and release that bowling ball in such a way that you can hit the head pin and knock down everything at once.  If you do not get it right then you will see that you are off balance and the ball will not hit the mark and then you will have to try it again.  We must determine to be disciplined in order to read Gods word and understand How to apply biblical principles to our lives.    We are powerless because we do not pray.    If you love someone you spend time with them and you talk with them and you share your heart with them.  You share your deepest secrets with them and you listen to what they have to say.  You learn how to become intimately involved in everything that they do and say.  Our relationship with God should be the primary relationship where we learn how to be intimate with regards to who we are in the kingdom of God and what God wants to share with us.  If you do not have quiet time where you can speak to God and LISTEN to what God says back to you then you will lack power in your life.  There is NO WAY that a professing Christian can overcome sin habits or addictions in their life if they are not willing to take the time to have intimate and regular conversations with God.  Only God can change you from the inside out.  Your pastor cannot do it.  Your spouse cannot do it.  Your children cannot do it.  Only GOD can change you into the image of WHO HE wants you to be.  God desires for you to have a CLOSE relationship so that HE can reveal who HE IS in the world around you.  You cannot get what God has to offer if you only talk to Him when you are desperate for your problems to be solved.    We are vulnerable because we separate ourselves from the body of Christ on a regular basis.   God designed relationships for a purpose other than for us to have an avenue to populate the planet. Have you ever asked a child who God is?  More often than not they will tell you His name is Jesus.  If you ask a child where God is they will probably put their hand over their hearts.   Children know that the kingdom of God resides in our hearts.  God made us to worship Him and he created us with a void in our hearts and souls that only He can fill.  The kingdom of God is all around us in the people who love Him and call Him the Lord of their lives.   No man is an island and we NEED to be around people who have the same faith beliefs that we do.  We need to be around people that think and feel and believe just like we do.  We draw strength and assurance from one another and we can help each other to be accountable for the integrity of our walk with Christ.    We need close personal relationships with other believers so that we can learn from one another as we share our victories and defeats.  This will require that we let down the walls of our hearts and be real with one another.  This will require that we commit to being a person that someone will be safe sharing their heart with.  So many folks have been burned and hurt because a careless tongue broke confidentiality.    We cannot experience Abundant Life that God intends for us to have when we fail to fully embrace the spiritual gifts that He has given us.   God gives us faith so that we can believe.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  We can believe in who God is because HE gives us the spiritual ability to believe through faith.  Hebrews 11:6 says 'But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.'     Corinthians I 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.  3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.  4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.  5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.  6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.  7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.  8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;  9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;  10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:  11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.  12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.  13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.  14 For the body is not one member, but many.   Did you know that God has given you a spiritual gift?  Do you know what that gift is?  Have you ever been challenged to find out?  Do you think that you can be a part of Gods plan to reach the world for Christ or minister to the body of Christ around you without God equipping you for the task?  Spiritual gifts do several things.     Glorify God and His Kingdom  Minister to the needs of the world around you  Convict people of sin in their lives  Causes healing and restoration  Brings forth Gods word  Defeats Satan who is your enemy  Gives Abundant Life to those who use them   We sometimes experience failure and defeat because we need to allow God to develop the fruit of the spirit in our lives  How will people KNOW that we are Christians?  They will know us by our Love for one another, God and our spiritual fruit. Have you ever gotten zealous for God and gone off half cocked?  Our intentions are good and we mean well.  The only problem is we are not prepared for some of the battles and challenges of life because God is not finished with us yet.  Growing in grace and maturity takes time.  There is no substitute for Gods timing in our lives and the discipline to be obedient to His word.  Lets examine the fruit of the spirit according to what Gods word says.  Matthew 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:   Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.     Do we have a right to judge whether or not someone is a true Christian? I would say a resounding no. Only God truly knows our hearts.  Do we have the ability or right to be fruit inspectors?  Yes, we can see how folks live their lives and if they are Disciples of Christ we will see evidence of this through the fruit that God will produce in their lives.  The following statements are Spiritual Confessions of Gods Abundant Life.  I got these from the back of one of the church handouts at Abundant Life Church in Houston Texas.    Please allow me to encourage you to embrace each one of these confessions.

"     Lynne, Dick Cheney Differ on Gay Marriage  By WILL LESTER, AP      WASHINGTON (July 11) - Lynne Cheney, the vice president's wife and mother of a lesbian, said Sunday that states should have the final say over the legal status of personal relationships.  That stand puts her at odds with the vice president on the need for the constitutional amendment now under debate in the Senate that effectively would ban gay marriage.  'I think that the constitutional amendment discussion will give us an opportunity to look for ways to discuss ways in which we can keep the authority of the states intact,'' Cheney told CNN's 'Late Edition.''  The Senate began debate Friday on an amendment that defines marriage as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife.  Supporters acknowledge the proposal is endorsed by only about half the Senate, well short of the two-thirds needed to approve a change in the Constitution. Still, a vote would put lawmakers on the spot in an election year as they seek to balance backing traditional marriage and gay rights.  Cheney has two daughters, both of whom are working in his campaign. The Cheney's gay daughter, Mary, is director of vice presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. She held a public role as her father's assistant in the 2000 campaign and helped the GOP recruit gay voters during the 2002 midterm elections.  She has been less visible this year while traveling with the vice president or working at campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va. As the election nears, she will play a more public role, campaign aides say.  President Bush said in his weekly radio address Saturday that legalizing gay marriage would redefine the most fundamental institution of civilization. A constitutional amendment is needed to protect marriage, he said.  During the 2000 campaign, vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney took the position states should decide legal issues about personal relationships and that people should be free to enter relationships of their choosing.  When Massachusetts' high court ruled last year that gay couples are entitled to wed, the issue became a very hot political topic. Republicans hope it will take votes away from the Democratic presidential ticket.  Both Bush and Cheney have voiced their support this year for the proposed constitutional amendment. Their Democratic rivals, Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, oppose the amendment.     The Democrats also oppose gay marriage, but defend a gay couple's rights to the same legal protections as those conferred in marriage.  Asked Sunday about her husband's stand on gay marriage in 2004, Lynne Cheney said, 'I thought that the formulation he used in 2000 was very good.  'First of all, to be clear that people should be free to enter into their relationships that they choose. And, secondly, to recognize what's historically been the situation, that when it comes to conferring legal status on relationships, that is a matter left to the states,'' she said.  Lynne Cheney said the situation in 2004 is somewhat different from the one four years ago because of the Massachusetts court ruling and its effect on states.  Asked again about the difference between the Democrats and the Bush administration on the amendment, Cheney reaffirmed her preference for local solutions.  The vice president's press office had no immediate comment Sunday.    Flaws Reportedly Found in Florida Touchscreen Voting   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (July 11) - Touchscreen voting machines didn't perform as well as devices that scanned paper ballots in this year's Florida Democratic presidential primary, raising questions about the state's voting process for the November election, a newspaper reported Sunday.  Gertrude Epstein tries out a touch screen voting machine made by Sequoia Voting Systems during a 2001 demonstration in Delray Beach, Florida.       An analysis of just under half of the ballots from the March 9 election shows that votes were not recorded for about one out of every 100 people using the new machines, or a 1.09 percent rate of undervotes, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported. An undervote is when a selection cannot be detected on a ballot.  That's at least eight times the number of undervotes in the same election on paper ballots marked with pencils and tallied by an optical scanner, which had a 0.12 percent rate of undervotes, the newspaper reported.  Undervotes were a problem in the contested 2000 presidential election, in which many Floridians cast their ballots on punch-card machines. After 36 days of legal wrangling and recounts, George W. Bush won Florida, and thus the White House, by just 537 votes.  According to a review sponsored by The Associated Press and other news organizations, about 61,190 of 6.1 million total ballots in that election were undervotes, or a 1 percent rate.  The state outlawed the punch-card machines after the 2000 election, and the touchscreen machines were billed as a way to avoid a repeat of the problems. Fifteen Florida counties now use touchscreen machines.  A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Glenda Hood, Florida's top elections official, did not return calls seeking comment Sunday.  The Sun-Sentinel analysis of the March 9 election reviewed nearly 350,000 ballots statewide, or about 44 percent of all ballots cast. The ballots analyzed had only one choice, selection of a Democratic Party presidential nominee.  The analysis found optical scan machines counted 12 overvotes in the March sample, where voters chose more than one candidate. Overvotes are impossible to cast on touchscreen machines. The media-sponsored review of the 2000 election found 113,820 overvotes, a 1.9 percent rate.  The newspaper's findings did not surprise officials of Sequoia Voting Systems and Elections Systems & Software, two companies manufacturing touchscreen machines sold in Florida.     ''The most important thing to take from the (Sun-Sentinel) survey findings is that both electronic systems and precinct-based optical scan systems dramatically reduce voter error. ... The Florida numbers demonstrate a substantive improvement over the 2000 presidential election,'' said Alfie Charles, vice president of business development for Sequoia.  Meghan McCormick, spokeswoman for ES&S, said some voters simply choose to cast blank ballots.  Theresa LePore, Palm Beach County elections supervisor, said it is almost impossible to eliminate undervotes because some people will choose not to vote for any candidate or will make mistakes.  ''There is only one perfect voting system,'' LePore said. ''That's the one that doesn't involve humans.''    Critics Sue Electronic Voting Company   Diebold Targeted Under Whistleblower Law  By RACHEL KONRAD, AP   SAN FRANCISCO (July 11) - Critics of electronic voting are suing Diebold Inc. under a whistleblower law, alleging that the company's shoddy balloting equipment exposed California elections to hackers and software bugs.  California's attorney general unsealed the lawsuit Friday. It was filed in November but sealed under a provision that keeps such actions secret until the government decides whether to join the plaintiffs.  Lawmakers from Maryland to California are expressing doubts about the integrity of paperless voting terminals made by several large manufacturers, which up to 50 million Americans will use in November.  The California lawsuit was filed in state court by computer programmer Jim March and activist Bev Harris, who are seeking full reimbursement for Diebold equipment purchased in California.  Issues cited by the case include Diebold's use of uncertified hardware and software, and modems that may have allowed election results to be published online before polls closed.  They are asking California to join the lawsuit against Diebold. The state has not yet made a decision.  State election officials have spent at least $8 million on paperless touchscreen machines. Alameda County, for one, has spent at least $11 million.  Under the whistleblower statute, March and Harris could collect up to 30 percent of any reimbursement.  ''This is about money now - a case of the capitalist system at work,'' said March, of Sacramento. ''The laws on voting products and processes are unfortunately unclear. But the law on defrauding the government is really, really clear. Going after the money trail is cleaner than going after proper procedures.''      Diebold spokesman David Bear said Saturday the company has not been served with the lawsuit and would not comment until it reviewed the case.  Election officials have until Sept. 7 to decide whether to join the lawsuit, said Tom Dresslar, spokesman for state Attorney General Bill Lockyer.  Alameda County also has not yet decided whether to participate, said Elaine Ginnold of the county's registrar of voters office. She said Diebold has been ''extremely responsive'' in addressing problems with its system used in the March primary, which forced at least 6,000 of 316,000 voters to use backup paper ballots.  ''I think we avoided a major crisis - it would have been much, much worse had we not had those paper ballot backups,'' Ginnold said.  Earlier this year, California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley banned one Diebold voting system unless counties met a host of conditions, including precautions to prevent tampering and giving paper ballots to voters who prefer them.  In the March primary, 573 of 1,038 polling places in San Diego County failed to open on time because of computer malfunctions. A software bug in North Carolina's 2002 general election deleted 436 electronic ballots from six paperless machines in two counties.  Some people are critical of the use of the whistleblower statute with its reward system for plaintiffs.  ''I would like to see people support a real solution rather than just try to cash in,'' said Alan Dechert, founder of Open Voting Consortium Inc., whose voting system relies on nonproprietary software. ''There are a lot of people who could be a tremendous asset, but they're grandstanding and reveling in the expose.''    (on story below) How much do you want to bet those 'provisional ballots' will only be approved if they're for the 'right' choice? - JG    Florida Scraps Flawed Felon Voting List    MIAMI (July 11) - Florida elections officials said Saturday they will not use a disputed list that was designed to keep felons from voting, acknowledging a flaw that could have allowed convicted Hispanic felons to cast ballots in November.  The glitch in a state that President Bush won by just 537 votes could have been significant - because of the state's sizable Cuban population, Hispanics in Florida have tended to vote Republican more than Hispanics nationally. The list had about 28,000 Democrats and around 9,500 Republicans, with most of the rest unaffiliated.  'Not including Hispanic felons that may be voters on the list ... was an oversight and a mistake,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said. 'And we accept responsibility and that's why we're pulling it back.''  Gov. Bush said the mistake occurred because two databases that were merged to form the disputed list were incompatible.  The problem in compiling the list was unintentional and unforeseen, said Nicole de Lara, a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Glenda Hood.  'Nevertheless, Supervisors of Elections are required to uphold their constitutional obligation'' and will find other ways to ensure felons are removed from the rolls, Hood said in a statement.  Florida is one of only a handful of states that does not automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons once they've completed their sentence.  The decision to scrap the list was made after it was reported that the list contained few people identified as Hispanic; of the nearly 48,000 people on the list created by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, only 61 were classified as Hispanics.  That was because when voters register in Florida, they can identify themselves as Hispanic. But the potential felons database has no Hispanic category, which excludes many people from the list if they put that as their race.  The law enforcement list was compared to the voter rolls to determine who should be barred from voting.  The glitch, first reported by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, affected only those who identified themselves as Hispanic. A review of the voter list by The Associated Press found others with Hispanic surnames who did not identify themselves as Hispanic.  The purge of felons from voter rolls has been a thorny issue since the 2000 presidential election. A private company hired to identify ineligible voters before the election produced a list with scores of errors, and elections supervisors used it to remove voters without verifying its accuracy. A federal lawsuit led to an agreement to restore rights to thousands of voters.  The new list was released July 1, with officials saying Gov. Bush's administration was simply complying with federal election law. Problems with the list were quickly detected.  State officials have said there are people on the list who are not felons, and elections workers have flagged more than 300 people listed who might have received clemency.  Another problem was that about 2,700 people who had received clemency were still on the list. That was because they had registered to vote before they received clemency. The state initially required them to register again, but later backed off.  Gov. Bush, the president's brother, spoke with Hood early Saturday and agreed with the decision that her office made.  'It was the right thing to do,'' Bush said.  Since the 2000 election, the secretary of state's office has been moved from Cabinet status in Florida to an agency under the Republican governor.  Many Democrats were convinced state officials purposely culled too many voters from the rolls in order to ensure President Bush's re-election. Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe called it a ``potential careless and needless disfranchisement of thousands of voters.''  Civil rights advocates who wanted the list thrown out applauded the decision, but said some damage has already been done.  'Certainly there will be some people who received a letter, telling them effectively that they're going to be purged, who have been dissuaded from going to the polls altogether,'' said Jessie Allen, associate counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.  State Sen. Les Miller, a Tampa Democrat who opposed the list, said he was pleased with Saturday's decision, but remained cautious.  'I still have a question mark in the back of my head, wondering what happens now,'' Miller said. 'Are they saying 'that's it, we're not going to utilize it henceforth and forever more?' I need to know that.''  Bush said the list will not be available to elections supervisors until he's comfortable that it actually will be 'a useful tool.''  Bush added, however, that he's concerned pulling back the list could mean 'that more people who shouldn't be voting will be voting.''  Election officials emphasized that the list is intended to be a starting point for county election supervisors.  On Election Day, anyone who feels they have been inadvertently removed from the voter rolls will be allowed to use a provisional ballot that will be examined later to determine eligibility.    (on story below)  Bush is the ONLY president in like 50 years to not speak to the NAACP at least once aftr election, especially when running for re-election.  I notice the bit about them calling him names...what is he, in second grade? I also like the 'drak underside' line - JG    NAACP Head Asks Bush to Rethink Convention Snub  By Jon Hurdle, Reuters   PHILADELPHIA (July 10) - The head of the largest and oldest U.S. civil rights group criticized President Bush on Saturday for once again refusing to speak at its convention this year and urged him to reconsider.  Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP, said it was 'unbelievable' that Bush had declined an invitation to speak at the organization's annual meeting for the fourth consecutive year.  'When you are president, you are elected to be president of all the people,' Mfume said at a news conference as the convention opened. 'You won't do that if you refuse to talk.'     He asked Bush to change his mind and promised that the Republican president would be treated with respect at the Philadelphia event this week even if many delegates oppose his politics.  A candidate who refuses to talk to any group risks losing votes in what is likely to be a tight presidential contest, Mfume said.  More than 12 million black people are registered to vote, according to the NAACP. Most are Democrats.  'I would ask the president to reconsider his unnecessarily harsh stance and to show America that he's bigger than that,' he said.  Mfume, a former congressman from Maryland, said Bush was courteously received the last time he spoke to National Association for the Advancement of Colored People at its 2000 meeting in Baltimore.  Bush, campaigning in Pennsylvania on Friday, said he would not attend this year's NAACP event. He said his relationship with its leadership was 'basically nonexistent' and he referred to being called 'names' by organization members.  NAACP Chairman Julian Bond last month said Bush and other Republicans were part of a 'dark underside of American culture.'  Founded in 1909, the NAACP says it has 500,000 adult and youth members.    (on story below) More on the NAACP thing.  He obviously has written off black people.  All the campaigns have written off people under 25.  Bush has written off women who're under 30 & single.  Makes you wonder, if he's not considering them for votes, is he considering them for ANYTHING?    NAACP Chairman Condemns Bush Policies  By PATRICK WALTERS, AP  PHILADELPHIA (July 11) - NAACP chairman Julian Bond condemned Bush administration policies on education, the economy and the war in Iraq on Sunday, imploring members of the nation's oldest civil rights organization to increase voter turnout to oust the president from office.  ''They preach racial neutrality and practice racial division,'' Bond said Sunday night in the 95th annual convention's keynote address. ''They've tried to patch the leaky economy and every other domestic problem with duct tape and plastic sheets. They write a new constitution of Iraq and they ignore the Constitution here at home.''  Bond, a leader in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s civil rights movement and a Georgia legislator for 20 years, became chairman of the Baltimore-based National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1998.  During the Philadelphia convention, volunteers have been working on voter drives in black communities.  Leaders of the group are upset that President Bush has no plans to attend. Bush spoke at the 2000 NAACP convention in Baltimore when he was a candidate but has declined invitations to speak in each year of his presidency, officials said.  Democratic challenger John Kerry has accepted an invitation to speak Thursday on the final day of the convention, the NAACP said.    Assets, Edwards' and others'   And will the current map of battleground states hold?  Thursday, July 8, 2004 Posted: 2:59 PM EDT (1859 GMT)   Carlos Watson SPECIAL REPORT     (CNN) -- This week in The Inside Edge, I take a look at some of the less obvious sides of several issues.  First, some subtle points in John Edwards' favor as the newly announced running mate of John Kerry.   Then, another unexpected-help possibility.   And third, the lay of the land -- can we depend on a list of battleground states to stay the same all the way through the electoral skirmish to come?   Edwards' other assets    While conventional Democratic wisdom holds that John Edwards will contribute strong campaigning skills and some Southern appeal to this year's ticket, he may help John Kerry's team in a couple of other ways, as well.  First, in selecting Edwards, John Kerry is actually getting two great campaigners for the price of one. Not only is Edwards a good campaigner, but keep your eye on his wife Elizabeth (also a lawyer), who is an easygoing, affable person and a strong campaigner, herself.  Second, while many people have predicted that Edwards may help Kerry in the South and Midwest, don't be surprised if he proves to be an effective campaigner in the West and Southwest as well. Edwards' sunny personality and 'Two Americas' message could be every bit as popular in New Mexico and Nevada as the Kerry team hopes they will be in Ohio and  Pennsylvania.  Third, Edwards' popularity among trial lawyers (arguably one of the three most important fund-raising groups for Democrats) may help him to raise even more money from that influential group for state parties and Democrats running for the Senate. In states like Louisiana, Florida and even his native South Carolina, that extra money (to be spent on  commercials and get-out-the-vote efforts) could make an important difference in a close election.  Fourth, in an era of photo-ops, the joint picture of the Kerry-Edwards families including Edwards' two young children may ultimately be a valuable and much-used image for the Democrats' ticket -- implicitly conveying warmth, vitality and family values. You can bet you will see this picture multiple times in the campaign -- in television ads, e-mails and more.  Finally, for all the ways that Edwards may help Kerry, the experience issue and his relationship with trial lawyers will be heavily scrutinized. Also, Edwards will very quickly have to prove that he can in fact be an asset in the South, particularly in his home state of North Carolina.   More unlikely help   Several months ago, I wrote about the possibility of Russia playing a crucial role in President Bush's re-election campaign by helping the Bush administration secure passage of a U.N. resolution and therefore move Iraq closer to stability. (Can Russia deliver votes for Bush?)  Sure enough, in June that happened and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined President Bush to announce the passage of a unanimous U.N. resolution on Iraq.  As Iraq enters a new phase, instead of turning to Germany or France, President Bush may once again look to an unlikely source for international help in Iraq.   In particular, the president may turn to the Arab world for critical support as more leaders there increasingly appreciate the risks to them of a failed Iraqi state. Last week, Jordan's King Abdullah II surprised many observers by suggesting that he would be willing to send troops to Iraq if asked. And don't be surprised in coming months to hear of new financial support for rebuilding Iraq from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and  new diplomatic support (and maybe more) from Egypt.  All three U.S. allies have played critical roles in past U.S. efforts in the Middle East, but have been largely silent during the recent engagement.   But again, the recent Iraqi-related events in Saudi Arabia (bombings and kidnappings) have reminded many in the region of the risks to them from Iraqi instability. Also, the fact that there are now Iraqi faces to deal with, too -- instead of just L. Paul Bremer -- may make helping out in Iraq a more palatable internal political option for some Arab  leaders.   The coming realignment   Generally, it's held that there are 17 to 19 battleground states in which the 2004 presidential election will be fought out to the bitter end. But don't be surprised to see some revisions in that list over the next two months.   Indeed, with the selection of a Democratic VP candidate, two major party conventions, hundreds of millions of dollars in political advertising, some vigorous Senate contests, Ralph Nader's impact and changes in the economy and Iraq, the political terrain may shift by the early fall in such a way that several states that seemed 'in play' come off the list -- and several that did not seem competitive begin to draw more attention.  In the West, Washington (for Kerry) and Arizona (for Bush) could come off the battleground list by early fall.   In the South, I could envision Georgia, Virginia and/or North Carolina possibly becoming more competitive for Kerry and getting added attention, but Arkansas might lean more definitively for Bush.   In the North, I think Maine and Delaware (only peripherally mentioned even now by some Republicans) may come off the toss-up list and move toward Kerry.   In the Midwest, I expect that all the toss-up states will remain on the heated battleground list as we enter the fall.  Finally, it's worth noting that while some states may get taken off one side's target list, it does not mean that the final contest will or will not be close.  Witness Ohio, which was de-emphasized by Democrats at the end of the last presidential election, but turned out to be closer than either side expected (less than 4 percent).  Keep your eye out for these critical battleground map revisions as November 2 approaches.   (On story below)  I was hoping 'Political Paddling' would be something else entirely.

MIRANDA  From CNN   Tuesday, Jul. 06, 2004 Gone are the days when voter-registration drives consisted of a quaint sign-up table at the local supermarket. With the presidential race shaping up as a tight one, some get-out-the-vote groups are turning up the marketing savvy. At an event in San Francisco in May, the group 1,000 Flowers offered free manicures and nail files to encourage single women to register; the organization hopes to sign up 10,000 women at beauty salons by the end of summer. Other groups are offering similarly creative incentives to vote.

FBI says Patriot Act used in Vegas strip club corruption probe  Associated Press ^ | 11-04-03  LAS VEGAS (AP) - The FBI used the USA Patriot Act to obtain financial information about key figures in a political corruption probe centered on striptease club owner Michael Galardi, an agent said.   Investigators used a section of the Patriot Act to get subpoenas for financial documents, said Special Agent Jim Stern, a spokesman for the Las Vegas FBI office.   'It was used appropriately by the FBI and was clearly within the legal parameters of the statute,' Stern said.   The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Tuesday that records were subpoenaed from Galardi, the owner of Jaguars in southern Nevada and Cheetah's in Las Vegas and San Diego; his lobbyist, former Clark County Commissioner Lance Malone; former Commissioner Erin Kenny; County Commission Chairwoman Mary Kincaid-Chauncey; former County Commission Chairman Dario Herrera; and Las Vegas City Councilman Michael McDonald, who lost a re-election bid in June.   The Patriot Act, passed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was originally touted by the government as a tool to help federal law enforcers combat and prevent terrorism.   Civil libertarians have criticized the Bush administration for employing the wide-ranging act to also crack down on drug traffickers and child pornographers.   The measure lets federal investigators seek financial records of people suspected of being terrorists or laundering money.   Malone's lawyer called it an outrage that the FBI used anti-terrorism measures in an effort to gather information on his client.   'The Patriot Act ... clearly was not intended for this,' Las Vegas lawyer Dominic Gentile said.   Gary Peck, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, said the Patriot Act included provisions 'that in no way had anything to do with the threat of terrorism, but could help them in your more garden variety criminal prosecutions.'   Attorney Richard Wright, who represents McDonald, said he was unaware investigators had used Patriot Act powers.   'It isn't anything that's lawfully known,' he said.   Federal authorities in San Diego say Galardi and Malone paid San Diego city officials to lift a ban on contact between topless dancers and their customers. Malone and three San Diego city councilmen await trial on public corruption charges.   A federal grand jury in Las Vegas also has been hearing evidence regarding allegations of public corruption in southern Nevada. No indictments have been announced in that case.    (on story below) Here is an article where a Justice guy says the PA wasn't 'just for going after terrorists'    Using the Patriot Act in Vegas strip clubs  November 12, 2003  By: Clarence Page Chicago Tribune   WASHINGTON - In our latest episode of continuing adventures with the USA Patriot Act, FBI agents say they've used the new anti- terrorism law to prosecute a political bribery case centered on the owner of some Las Vegas strip clubs. What do topless dancers in Vegas have to do with terrorism, you may ask? Nothing, everyone agrees, unless perhaps you count the violence that some of the ladies inflict on the wallets of their  clientele.   Nevertheless, the FBI now confirms local Las Vegas newspaper reports that the agency used the Patriot Act's provisions to subpoena financial information about four local politicians and one local businessman, Michael D. Galardi, the owner of the Jaguars strip club in Las Vegas and Cheetahs clubs in Las Vegas and San Diego.   The Patriot Act, passed in the panicky weeks after 9/11, allows the government to peek into the personal affairs of many people, not just suspected terrorists. The law's powers only begin with suspected terrorists. We have yet to learn how far it extends.   That's the part that Attorney General John Ashcroft does not talk about much as he tours the country touting the powers the Patriot Act has given the federal government to fight terrorism.   'We have used these tools to save innocent American lives,' Mr. Ashcroft told a convention of law officers at the federal courthouse in Las Vegas in August. 'We have used these tools to provide the security that ensures liberty.'   He neglected to mention how, even as he spoke, Las Vegas FBI agents were using those 'tools' to go after a strip club owner and the politicians he allegedly paid off.   It turns out that Section 314 of the Patriot Act allows federal investigators wider leeway in obtaining financial information from stockbrokers, banks and other financial institutions on people 'suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering.' Pay close attention to that last phrase: 'or money laundering.' Ah, what legal power that little word 'or' contains. Thanks to that teeny  but mighty conjunction, the Patriot Act is not limited to money laundering that is linked to suspected terrorist acts but to any suspected money laundering.   'The Patriot Act was not meant to be just for terrorism,' Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo told a reporter.   Now they tell us.   Before the Patriot Act became law, FBI agents needed a subpoena from a grand jury to demand financial records. Under Section 314, agents no longer need trouble themselves with facing a grand jury, which is, after all, made up of only ordinary citizens. Instead, agents need only certify in a secret documentation a reasonable suspicion that money laundering is taking place.   Only after the case comes to trial can a judge rule on whether the agents' certification was adequate. If not, the judge can throw out all the evidence gathered as a result of the bogus certification, according to the Justice Department spokesmen.   Why, one wonders, is the normal subpoena process such a bother all of a sudden? Since when it is so hard to prosecute public corruption in Las Vegas, a possibility that rivals gambling in Casablanca on most people's shock-o-meters?   The Justice Department spokesman said the American people expect law enforcement officers to use any and all constitutional and legal tools to fight all crime, whether it is terror-related or not.   Maybe that's so. After all, it is just allegedly corrupt politicians and strip club owners we're talking about here and not the sort of people for whom, say, the Moral Majority would go to bat.   Most anti-abortion groups probably felt that way about the federal RICO (Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) law until pro-choice groups persuaded the federal government to use it against aggressive protests at abortion clinics. Anti- abortion groups cheered when the Supreme Court overturned that use of anti-crime law last spring in Scheidler vs. NOW. Now we shall wait to see how many of them join hands with civil libertarians as the government overreaches with the Patriot Act.   Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle are expressing reservations about the potential for wretched governmental excesses under the Patriot Act. Fortunately, the law must be renewed in 2005. That gives Congress time to reconsider its 342 pages in a calmer atmosphere than that which followed the 2001 terrorist attacks.   I hope they debate wisely. Concern for civil liberties should be equally important to both political parties. After all, the privacy you save may be your own.

"    How George W. Bush became the head of the new American Dominionist Church/State   By Katherine Yurica With Editorial and Research Assistant Laurie Hall February 11, 2004   The First Prince of the Theocratic States of America    It happened quietly, with barely a mention in the media. Only the Washington Post dutifully reported it.[1] And only Kevin Phillips saw its significance in his new book, American Dynasty.[2] On December 24, 2001, Pat Robertson resigned his position as President of the Christian Coalition.  Behind the scenes religious conservatives were abuzz with excitement. They believed Robertson had stepped down to allow the ascendance of the President of the United States of America to take his rightful place as the head of the true American Holy Christian Church.  Robertson’s act was symbolic, but it carried a secret and solemn revelation to the faithful. It was the signal that the Bush administration was a government under God that was led by an anointed President who would be the first regent in a dynasty of regents awaiting the return of Jesus to earth. The President would now be the minister through whom God would execute His will in the nation. George W. Bush accepted his scepter and his sword with humility, grace and a sense of exultation.  As Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court explained a few months later, the Bible teaches and Christians believe “… that government …derives its moral authority from God. Government is the ‘minister of God’ with powers to ‘revenge,’ to ‘execute wrath,’ including even wrath by the sword…”[3]  George W. Bush began to wield the sword of God’s revenge with relish from the beginning of his administration, but most of us missed the sword play. I have taken the liberty to paraphrase an illustration from Leo Strauss, the father of the neo-conservative movement, which gives us a clue of how the hiding is done:  “One ought not to say to those whom one wants to kill, ‘Give me your votes, because your votes will enable me to kill you and I want to kill you,’ but merely, ‘Give me your votes,’ for once you have the power of the votes in your hand, you can satisfy your desire.”[4]  Notwithstanding the advice, the President’s foreign policy revealed a flair for saber rattling. He warned the world that “nations are either with us or they’re against us!” His speeches, often containing allusions to biblical passages, were spoken with the certainty of a man who holds the authority of God’s wrath on earth, for he not only challenged the evil nations of the world, singling out Iraq, Syria, Iran, and North Korea as the “axis of evil,” but he wielded the sword of punishment and the sword of revenge against his own people: the American poor and the middle class who according to the religious right have earned God’s wrath by their licentiousness and undisciplined lives.  To the middle class he said, “I’m going to give you clear skies clean air and clean water,” then he gutted the environmental controls that were designed to provide clean air and water. The estimated number of premature deaths that will result: 100,000.[5] He said to the poor and to the middle class: “I’m going to give you a prescription drug program, one that you truly deserve.” Then he gave the drug industry an estimated $139 billion dollars in increased profits from the Medicare funds and arranged for the poorest of seniors to be eliminated from coverage, while most elderly will pay more for drugs than they paid before his drug benefit bill passed.[6] After that he arranged for the dismantling of the Medicare program entirely, based on the method outlined by his religious mentors.[7] He said to the people of America, “I’m going to build a future for you and your children,” then he gutted their future with tax breaks to the rich and a pre-emptive war against Iraq, and the largest spending deficit in history.[8]  This article is the documented story of how a political religious movement called Dominionism gained control of the Republican Party, then took over Congress, then took over the White House, and now is sealing the conversion of America to a theocracy by taking over the American Judiciary.  It’s the story of why and how “the wrath of God Almighty” will be unleashed against the middle class, against the poor, and against the elderly and sick of this nation by George W. Bush and his army of Republican Dominionist “rulers.”    How Dominionism Was Spread    The years 1982-1986 marked the period Pat Robertson and radio and televangelists urgently broadcast appeals that rallied Christian followers to accept a new political religion that would turn millions of Christians into an army of political operatives. It was the period when the militant church raised itself from centuries of sleep and once again eyed power.  At the time, most Americans were completely unaware of the militant agenda being preached on a daily basis across the breadth and width of America. Although it was called “Christianity” it can barely be recognized as Christian. It in fact was and is a wolf parading in sheep’s clothing: It was and is a political scheme to take over the government of the United States and then turn that government into an aggressor nation that will forcibly establish the United States as the ruling empire of the twenty-first century. It is subversive, seditious, secretive, and dangerous.[9]  Dominionism is a natural if unintended extension of Social Darwinism and is frequently called “Christian Reconstructionism.” Its doctrines are shocking to ordinary Christian believers and to most Americans. Journalist Frederick Clarkson, who has written extensively on the subject, warned in 1994 that Dominionism “seeks to replace democracy with a theocratic elite that would govern by imposing their interpretation of ‘Biblical Law.’” He described the ulterior motive of Dominionism is to eliminate “…labor unions, civil rights laws, and public schools.” Clarkson then describes the creation of new classes of citizens:  “Women would be generally relegated to hearth and home. Insufficiently Christian men would be denied citizenship, perhaps executed. So severe is this theocracy that it would extend capital punishment [to] blasphemy, heresy, adultery, and homosexuality.”[10]  Today, Dominionists hide their agenda and have resorted to stealth; one investigator who has engaged in internet exchanges with people who identify themselves as religious conservatives said, “They cut and run if I mention the word ‘Dominionism.’”[11]  Joan Bokaer, the Director of Theocracy Watch, a project of the Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy at Cornell University wrote, “In March 1986, I was on a speaking tour in Iowa and received a copy of the following memo [Pat] Robertson had distributed to the Iowa Republican County Caucus titled, “How to Participate in a Political Party.” It read:  “Rule the world for God.  “Give the impression that you are there to work for the party, not push an ideology.  “Hide your strength.  “Don’t flaunt your Christianity.  “Christians need to take leadership positions. Party officers control political parties and so it is very important that mature Christians have a majority of leadership positions whenever possible, God willing.”[12]  Dominionists have gained extensive control of the Republican Party and the apparatus of government throughout the United States; they continue to operate secretly. Their agenda to undermine all government social programs that assist the poor, the sick, and the elderly is ingeniously disguised under false labels that confuse voters. Nevertheless, as we shall see, Dominionism maintains the necessity of laissez-faire economics, requiring that people “look to God and not to government for help.”[13]  It is estimated that thirty-five million Americans who call themselves Christian, adhere to Dominionism in the United States, but most of these people appear to be ignorant of the heretical nature of their beliefs and the seditious nature of their political goals. So successfully have the televangelists and churches inculcated the idea of the existence of an outside “enemy,” which is attacking Christianity, that millions of people have perceived themselves rightfully overthrowing an imaginary evil anti-Christian conspiratorial secular society.  When one examines the progress of its agenda, one sees that Dominionism has met its time table: the complete takeover of the American government was predicted to occur by 2004.[14] Unless the American people reject the GOP’s control of the government, Americans may find themselves living in a theocracy that has already spelled out its intentions to change every aspect of American life including its cultural life, its Constitution and its laws.  Born in Christian Reconstructionism, which was founded by the late R. J. Rushdoony, the framers of the new cult included Rushdoony, his son-in-law Gary North, Pat Robertson, Herb Titus, the former Dean of Robertson’s Regent University School of Public Policy (formerly CBN University), Charles Colson, Robertson’s political strategist, Tim LaHaye, Gary Bauer, the late Francis Schaeffer, and Paul Crouch, the founder of TBN, the world’s largest television network, plus a virtual army of likeminded television and radio evangelists and news talk show hosts.  Dominionism started with the Gospels and turned the concept of the invisible and spiritual “Kingdom of God” into a literal political empire that could be taken by force, starting with the United States of America. Discarding the original message of Jesus and forgetting that Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world,” the framers of Dominionism boldly presented a Gospel whose purpose was to inspire Christians to enter politics and execute world domination so that Jesus could return to an earth prepared for his earthly rule by his faithful “regents.”   How Machiavellianism, Communism, Secular Humanism and Neo-Conservatism Inspired a New Militant and Evil Anti-Christian Religion   In the fifties and sixties, right-wing Christians worried about communists and communism taking over the world. Along with communism, another enemy to Christianity was identified by ministers. In 1982, Francis Schaeffer, who was then the leading evangelical theologian, called Secular Humanism the greatest threat to Christianity the world had ever seen. Soon American fundamentalists and Pentecostals were seeing “humanists” everywhere. Appearing on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club show, Schaeffer claimed that humanism was being forced on Christians; it taught that man was the “center of all things.” Like communism, secular humanism was based on atheism, which was sufficient enough for Schaeffer to conclude that humanism was an enemy to the Kingdom of God.[15]  “The enemy is this other view of reality,” Schaeffer spoke emotionally. Citing the Declaration of Independence as his authorizing document, he said:  “Today we live in a humanist society. They control the schools. They control public television. They control the media in general. And what we have to say is we live in a humanist society….[Because] the courts are not subject to the will of the people through elections or re-election… all the great changes in the last forty years have come through the courts. And what we must get in our mind is the government as a whole, but especially the courts, has become the vehicle to force this view on the total population, even if the total population doesn’t hold the view.”[16]  Schaeffer claimed that the major “titanic changes” to America occurred since 1942:  “If you don’t revolt against tyranny and this is what I call the bottom line, is that not only do you have the privilege but [you have] the duty to revolt. When people force upon you and society that which is absolutely contrary to the Word of God, and which really is tyranny…we have a right to stand against it as a matter of principle. And this was the basis upon which the founding fathers built this country.”  The appeal to evangelicals went further. On April 29, 1985, Billy Graham, the respected and world famous evangelist, told Pat Robertson’s audience on the 700 Club show that:  “[T]he time has come when evangelicals are going to have to think about getting organized corporately….I’m for evangelicals running for public office and winning if possible and getting control of the Congress, getting control of the bureaucracy, getting control of the executive branch of government. I think if we leave it to the other side we’re going to be lost. I would like to see every true believer involved in politics in some way shape or form.”  According to Schaeffer, Robertson, and Billy Graham, then arguably the three most famous and influential leaders in the American protestant church world, “God’s people” had a moral duty to change the government of the United States.[17]  Significantly, at the time, many other fundamentalist ministers were identifying communism and secular humanism as religions. However, the equating of a political ideology on the one hand, and a philosophy that rejects supernaturalism on the other hand, with religions was not accidental.[18] It allowed the preachers to revile an economic-political system as well as a philosophy as false religions, even demonic religions, which Christians should reject at any cost.[19]  Underneath the pejoratives, however, there was a grudging admiration on the part of Pat Robertson and the other politically astute Dominionists, for they saw that a political agenda that wrapped itself in religious robes had the innate power to explode exponentially into the most politically dynamic movement in American and world history.  The result of the new religion was that by the year 2000, thirty-five million Americans would declare war on the remaining 245 million. Karl Rove, President Bush’s political advisor, told the Family Research Council in 2002, “We need to find ways to win the war.”[20] One is tempted to respond, “Wait a minute, they’re in power so why do they need to continue the war?”  That is the salient question. The answer is frightening.   Starting with a simple idea, Robertson perceived the enormous advantage of placing an otherwise unacceptable political theory into a religious context. By doing so it would stand Christianity up-side-down and end American democracy.   A Machiavellian Religion Was Born   American Christianity had already seen extremes. For Dominionists, perhaps the single most important event in the last half of the twentieth century occurred when the Reverend Jim Jones proved that the religious would follow their leader to Guyana and even further, to their deaths. That fact could hardly have escaped the notice of even the dullest of politically minded preachers.  Indeed, Jim Jones’ surreal power over his congregants leaps out from the grave even today. If a man desired to change the laws in America—to undo Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal for instance, and allow corporations the unbridled freedom they enjoyed prior to the Great Depression (which included the freedom to defraud, pillage, and to destroy the land with impunity on the way to gathering great fortunes), what better way to proceed than to cloak the corruption within a religion? If a few men wanted to establish an American empire and control the entire world, what better vehicle to carry them to their goal than to place their agenda within the context of a religion? Jim Jones proved religious people would support even immoral political deeds if their leaders found a way to frame those deeds as “God’s Will.” The idea was brilliant. Its framers knew they could glorify greed, hate, nationalism and even a Christian empire with ease.[21]  The religion the canny thinkers founded follows the reverse of communism and secular humanism, it poured political and economic ideology into a religion and that combustible mixture produced “Dominionism,” a new political faith that had the additional advantage of insulating the cult from attacks on its political agenda by giving its practitioners the covering to simply cry out, “You’re attacking me for my religious beliefs and that’s religious persecution!”[22]  But how could a leader get away with a religious fraud that barely hides its destructive and false intent?  Jim Jones’s history holds the answer. He not only proved the obvious fact that people are blinded by their religious beliefs and will only impute goodness, mercy, and religious motivations to their leader, but Jim Jones proved the efficacy of the basic teaching of Machiavelli: a leader must only appear to have the qualities of goodness—he need not actually possess those attributes.  In fact, Machiavelli taught that it is dangerous for a leader to practice goodness. Instead, he must pretend to be good and then do the opposite. Machiavelli taught that a leader will succeed on appearances alone. A good leader puts his finger to the wind and changes course whenever it is expedient to do so. Machiavelli wrote this revealing passage that could be applied not only to false religious leaders but to a false President:     “Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, he thought of nothing else, and found the occasion for it; no man was ever more able to give assurances, or affirmed things with stronger oaths, and no man observed them less; however, he always succeeded in his deceptions, as he well knew this aspect of things.”  “Everybody sees what you appear to be, few feel what you are, and those few will not dare to oppose themselves to the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of men, and especially of princes, from which there is no appeal, the end justifies the means.” (p. 93)  Chillingly Machiavelli advises his readers:  “Let a prince therefore aim at conquering and maintaining the state, and the means will always be judged honourable and praised by every one, for the vulgar is always taken by appearances and the issue of the event; and the world consists only of the vulgar, and the few who are not vulgar are isolated when the many have a rallying point in the prince.” (p. 94)  Machiavelli also wrote how to govern dominions that previous to being occupied lived under their own laws. His words eerily reflect the Bush Administration’s decisions on how to rule Iraq:  “When those states which have been acquired are accustomed to live at liberty under their own laws, there are three ways of holding them. The first is to despoil them;[23] the second is to go and live there in person; the third is to allow them to live under their own laws, taking tribute of them, and creating within the country a government composed of a few who will keep it friendly to you. Because this government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot exist without his friendship and protection, and will do all it can to keep them. What is more, a city used to liberty can be more easily held by means of its citizens than in any other way, if you wish to preserve it.” (p. 46)  However Machiavelli has second thoughts and follows with this caveat:  “…. [I]n truth there is no sure method of holding them except by despoiling them. And whoever becomes the ruler of a free city and does not destroy it, can expect to be destroyed by it, for it can always find a motive for rebellion in the name of liberty and of its ancient usages…”[24] (p. 46)  (The above quotes are from The Prince in the original Oxford University Press translation by Luigi Ricci, 1903; revised by E. R. P. Vincent, 1935)  Machiavelli’s books, The Prince and The Discourses are not abstract treatises. Christian Gauss, who wrote an important introduction to the Oxford edition, called them by their rightful name: they are in fact a “concise manual—a handbook of those who would acquire or increase their political power.” Gauss tells us that a long line of kings and ministers and tyrants studied Machiavelli, including Mussolini, Hitler, Lenin and Stalin.     How Can Evil Deeds Be Reconciled With Christian Beliefs?   It’s important to understand that the founders of Dominionism are sitting on the horns of a moral dilemma: How can a leader be both good and evil at the same time? For if biblical moral proscriptions are applicable to him, he will certainly suffer some form of censure. And if proscriptions are applicable, the leader could not lie to the citizenry with impunity or do evil so that “good” could be achieved. The answer to the dilemma of how a Dominionist leader could both do evil and still maintain his place of honor in the Christian community lies in the acceptance and adoption of the Calvinistic doctrine that James Hogg wrote about in The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner.  (W.W. Norton, N.Y. 1970.)  This novel, published in 1824, is concerned with psychological aberration and as such, anticipates the literature of the twentieth century. The protagonist is a young man named Robert, who drenched in the religious bigotry of Calvinism, concluded that he was predestined before the beginning of the world to enter heaven, therefore no sin he committed would be held to his account. This freed Robert to become an assassin in the cause of Christ and His Church.  Fifty years ago a variation on the concept was expressed disapprovingly as, “Once saved—always saved.” In this view, salvation had nothing to do with “good works or a holy life.” A drunk who had a born again experience would be among God’s chosen elect whether he stopped drinking or not. But the logical extension of the reasoning is the idea that Christianity could have within itself not ex-sinners but active sinners: as Christian murderers, Christian pedophiles, Christian rapists, Christian thieves, Christian arsonists, and every other kind of socio-pathological behavior possible. As we have sadly witnessed of late the concept is broadly accepted within the American churches.  But the Dominionists needed the aberrant extension of Calvinism; they believe as did Calvin and John Knox that before the creation of the universe, all men were indeed predestined to be either among God’s elect or were unregenerate outcasts. And it is at this point Dominionists introduced a perversion to Calvinism—the same one James Hogg utilizes in his The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner—its technical name is “supralapsarianism.” It means essentially that the man called from before the foundation of the world to be one of the elect of God’s people, can do no wrong. No wonder then observers noted a definite religious swing in George W. Bush from Wesleyan theology to Calvinism early in his administration.[25]  How comforting the Calvinistic idea of a “justified sinner” is when one is utilizing Machiavellian techniques to gain political control of a state. It’s more than comforting; it is a required doctrine for “Christians” who believe they must use evil to bring about good. It justifies lying, murder, fraud and all other criminal acts without the fuss of having to deal with guilt feelings or to feel remorse for the lives lost through executions, military actions, or assassinations.  If this doctrine seems too wayward to believe as it might have done had I not heard a recent interview with a Pentecostal minister—rest assured the twisted doctrine is horribly alive and thriving in America today.  The interview conducted by Brian Copeland a news talk show host for KGO, San Francisco on September 5, 2003, was with the Reverend Donald Spitz of Pensacola, Florida who is involved with a Pro Life group in Virginia and with the Army of God. The occasion was the execution of Paul Hill, another Pentecostal minister who murdered a doctor and his body guard outside an abortion clinic. Hill was caught and convicted of the crimes. Spitz admitted that he was Paul Hill’s spiritual counselor. He said Hill died with the conviction he had done the Lord’s work. Spitz who approved of the murder said, “Someone else is going to handle the publishing of Paul Hill’s book On How to Assassinate.”  Spitz believed that Hill was completely justified in murdering the physician because, according to him, “twenty-six babies’ lives were saved by the killing.”  When Copeland pointed out that the scheduled abortions for the morning of the murders would have simply been postponed to another day—and that the lives of the fetuses were only extended for a day or so, Spitz refused to accept the argument.  Not surprisingly, Spitz opposed the use of birth control methods. Copeland asked, “If a woman is raped should she be forced to carry the fetus to term?” Spitz said, “Yes.”   “What if the pregnancy will kill the mother?” Spitz replied that under no circumstances could “the baby be killed.” When Spitz was asked, “Why haven’t you gone out and killed an abortionist?” he replied calmly, “God hasn’t told me to do the killing.”   The Neo-Conservative Connection with Dominionists and Machiavelli   I suspect that most Americans have never heard of Machiavelli, nevertheless, it should be no surprise to us that Machiavelli has been accepted, praised, and followed by the Neo-Conservatives in the White House and his precepts are blindly adopted by the so-called “Christian” Dominionists. Kevin Phillips tells us in his masterful book, American Dynasty that Karl Rove, political strategist for President George W. Bush, is a devotee of Machiavelli, just as Rove’s predecessor, Lee Atwater had been for the elder Bush.[26] In fact, there has been an incredible effort to dilute the immoral implications of Machiavelli’s teachings. Today’s best apologist for Machiavelli is one of the most influential voices in Washington with direct connections into the oval office.  Michael A. Ledeen was a Senior Fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a counselor to the National Security Council and special counselor to former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig in 1985. His relationship with Pat Robertson goes back at least to the early 1980’s.[27]  Like Robertson, Ledeen was an advocate for military intervention in Nicaragua and for assistance to the Contras. (Ledeen was also involved in the Iran-Contra affair.)[28]  Today, in 2004, Michael Ledeen is a fellow at the conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute and according to William O. Beeman of the Pacific News Service, “Ledeen has become the driving philosophical force behind the neoconservative movement and the military actions it has spawned.”[29]  Ledeen made a number of appearances on the 700 Club show during the 1980’s. Always presented as a distinguished guest, Robertson interviewed him on April 30, 1985 and asked him on this occasion: “What would you recommend if you were going to advise the President [Ronald Reagan] as to foreign policy?”  Ledeen responded:  “The United States has to make clear to the world and above all to its own citizens, what our vital interests are. And then we must make it clear to everyone that we are prepared to fight and fight fiercely to defend those interests, so that people will not cross the lines that are likely to kick off a trip wire.” (Emphasis added.)  If Ledeen’s advice sounds ruthless and Machiavellian—it may be because it is Machiavellian. (By definition his statement presupposes the existence of something or several things that are life threatening to the nation by the use of the word “vital.” Yet Ledeen asserts that which is life threatening must be made manifest or defined. If an interest must be defined, then it is not apparent; yet the nation will nevertheless ask its sons and daughters to fight and die for something that is not apparent. Therefore, whatever “interests” Ledeen wanted to be defined, cannot have been vital interests, which are apparent—so in reality he advised the President to call discretionary interests vital—which is a lie.)  Be aware that Ledeen is in complete accord with Machiavellian thinking. And so is Pat Robertson.[30] Robertson agreed to virtually every nuance Ledeen presented. In fact, it’s not clear which of the two first proposed invading Syria, Iran and Iraq back in the 1980’s,[31] a refrain that also echoed in the reports of the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), one of the major homes for neo-conservatives in 2000. Both Ledeen and Robertson targeted the same nations that PNAC lists as America’s greatest enemies in its paper, “Rebuilding America’s Defenses” (published in September 2000.)[32]  In 1999, Ledeen published his book, Machiavelli on Modern Leadership: Why Machiavelli’s Iron Rules Are as Timely and Important Today as Five Centuries Ago. (Truman Talley Books, St. Martin’s Griffin, N.Y. 1999.) Here is a sample of how Ledeen smoothes rough edges and presents a modern Machiavelli:  “In order to achieve the most noble accomplishments, the leader may have to ‘enter into evil.’ This is the chilling insight that has made Machiavelli so feared, admired, and challenging. It is why we are drawn to him still…” (p. 91)  Again, Ledeen writes:  “Just as the quest for peace at any price invites war and, worse than war, defeat and domination, so good acts sometimes advance the triumph of evil, as there are circumstances when only doing evil ensures the victory of a good cause.” (p. 93)  Ledeen clearly believes “the end justifies the means,” but not all the time. He writes “Lying is evil,” but then contradictorily argues that it produced  “a magnificent result,” and “is essential to the survival of nations and to the success of great enterprises.” (p. 95)  Ledeen adds this tidbit:  “All’s fair in war . . . and in love. Practicing deceit to fulfill your heart’s desire might be not only legitimate, but delicious!” (p. 95)  William O. Beeman tells us about Michael Ledeen’s influence. Writing for the Pacific News Service he says:   “Ledeen’s ideas are repeated daily by such figures as Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz…He basically believes that violence in the service of the spread of democracy is America’s manifest destiny. Consequently, he has become the philosophical legitimator of the American occupation of Iraq.”[33]  In fact, Ledeen’s influence goes even further. The BBC, the Washington Post and Jim Lobe writing for the Asia Times report that Michael Ledeen is the only full-time international affairs analyst consulted by Karl Rove.[34] Ledeen has regular conversations with Rove. The Washington Post said, “More than once, Ledeen has seen his ideas faxed to Rove, become official policy or rhetoric.”[35]   Leo Strauss the Father of Neo-Conservatism   Leo Strauss was born in 1899 and died in 1973. He was a Jewish scholar who fled Germany when Hitler gained power. He eventually found refuge in the United States where he taught political science at the University of Chicago. He is most famous for resuscitating Machiavelli and introducing his principles as the guiding philosophy of the neo-conservative movement. Strauss has been called the godfather of Newt Gingrich’s “Contract with America.” More than any other man, Strauss breathed upon conservatism, inspiring it to rise from its atrophied condition and its natural dislike of change and to embrace an unbounded new political ideology that rides on the back of a revolutionary steed, hailing even radical change; hence the name Neo-Conservatives.  The father of neo-conservatism had many “spiritual” children at the University of Chicago, among them: Paul Wolfowitz and Abram Shulsky, who received their doctorates under Strauss in 1972. Harry V. Jaffa was a student of Strauss and has an important connection to Dominionists like Pat Robertson as we shall see below. However, Strauss’s family of influence extended beyond his students to include faculty members in universities, and the people his students taught. Those prominent neo-conservatives who are most notable are: Justice Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, Irving Kristol and his son William Kristol, Alan Keyes, William J. Bennett, J. Danforth Quayle, Allan Bloom, John Podhoertz, John T. Agresto, John Ashcroft, Newt Gingrich, Gary Bauer, Michael Ledeen and scores of others, many of whom hold important positions in George W. Bush’s White House and Defense Department.  To understand the Straussian infusion of power that transformed an all but dead conservative realm, think of Nietzsche’s Overman come to life. Or better yet, think of the philosophy most unlike Christianity: Think of pure unmitigated evil. Strauss admits that Machiavelli is an evil man. But according to Strauss, this admission is a prerequisite to studying and reading Machiavelli: the acknowledgement is the safety net that keeps the reader from being corrupted. One is tempted to talk back to Strauss and point out an alternative: the admission could be the subterfuge that keeps a man from being ridiculed and rejected for espousing Machiavellian methods.  In one of the most important books for our times, Shadia Drury’s Leo Strauss and the American Right, undertakes to explain the ideas behind Strauss’s huge influence and following. Strauss’s reputation, according to Drury, rests in large part on his view that “a real philosopher must communicate quietly, subtly, and secretly to the few who are fit to receive his message.” Strauss claims secrecy is necessary to avoid “persecution.”[36]  In reading Strauss, one sometimes encounters coded contradictory ideas. For example, Strauss appears to respect Machiavelli because—as he points out—in contrast to other evil men, Machiavelli openly proclaimed opinions that others only secretly expressed behind closed doors. But we have just noted that Strauss teaches that secrecy is essential to the real philosopher. Strauss concluded, some would say that Machiavelli was after all, a patriot of sorts for he loved Italy more than he loved his own soul. Then Strauss warns, but if you call him a patriot, you “merely obscure something truly evil.”[37] So Strauss dances his way through the Machiavellian field of evil, his steps choreographed with duplicity and it’s opposite. The reader cannot let go.  In Strauss’s view, Machiavelli sees that Christianity “has led the world into weakness,” which can only be offset by returning the world to the ancient practices of the past. (Implied is not a return to the pagan past, but rather a return to the more virulent world of the Old Testament). Strauss laments, “Machiavelli needed …a detailed discussion revealing the harmony between his political teaching and the teaching of the Bible.” [38]These statements of Strauss, by themselves, were sufficient to send neo-conservative Christians to search for correlations between Machiavellianism, radical conservatism and the scriptures.[39]  Strauss’s teaching incorporated much of Machiavelli’s. Significantly, his philosophy is unfriendly to democracy—even antagonistic.  At the same time Strauss upheld the necessity for a national religion not because he favored religious practices, but because religion in his view is necessary in order to control the population. Since neo-conservatives influenced by Strauss are in control of the Bush administration, I have prepared a brief list that shows the radical unchristian basis of neo-conservatism. I am indebted to Shadia Drury’s book (Leo Strauss and the American Right) and published interviews for the following:  First: Strauss believed that a leader had to perpetually deceive the citizens he ruled.  Secondly: Those who lead must understand there is no morality, there is only the right of the superior to rule the inferior.  Thirdly:  According to Drury, Religion “is the glue that holds society together.”[40] It is a handle by which the ruler can manipulate the masses. Any religion will do. Strauss is indifferent to them all.  Fourthly: “Secular society…is the worst possible thing,” because it leads to individualism, liberalism, and relativism, all of which encourage dissent and rebellion. As Drury sums it up: “You want a crowd that you can manipulate like putty.”[41]  Fifthly: “Strauss thinks that a political order can be stable only if it is united by an external threat; and following Machiavelli, he maintains that if no external threat exists, then one has to be manufactured.”[42]  Sixthly: “In Strauss’s view, the trouble with liberal society is that it dispenses with noble lies and pious frauds. It tries to found society on secular rational foundations.”   Strauss’s Student, Harry Jaffa on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson   For four days in 1986, from July first through the fourth of July, Pat Robertson interviewed neo-conservative Dr. Harry Jaffa, a former student of Leo Strauss, on the 700 Club show. The topic was the importance of the Declaration of Independence. Joining with Jaffa was Robertson’s own man, Herb Titus, the Dean of CBN’s School of Public Policy. This series of interviews was one of the most important philosophical moments in the development of the political agenda and political philosophy of the Dominionists.  Robertson found in Harry Jaffa, the champion he needed, whose reasoning would influence how the Constitution should be interpreted by conservatives and would provide a “Christian” view of the establishment of the United States that excluded the secular social contract view. Harry Jaffa would influence both Clarence Thomas (who would be appointed to the Supreme Court by President George Bush senior in 1991) and Antonin Scalia (who would be appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan on September 26, 1986).  During the four days of interviews Jaffa and Titus agreed that the Declaration of Independence was the premier document and it superceded the Constitution. Titus said, “The Declaration…is the charter of the nation. It is what you might call the articles of incorporation, whereas the Constitution is the bylaws. The Constitution is the means by which to carry out the great purposes that are articulated in the Declaration.”  Robertson asked: “Let’s assume that eighty percent of the people are just totally immoral, they want to live lives of gross licentiousness and they want to prey on one another, that’s what they want and they want a government to let them do it. How does that square with the Declaration of Independence and its consent of the governed?”  Titus said, “Even the people can’t consent to give away that which God says is unalienable.”  Robertson then asked, “The principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, how far have we gone from it and what can we do to redress some of these problems?”  Jaffa responded cryptically:  “I’d say that today, for example in the Attorney General’s [Edwin Meese’s] warfare with the liberals on the Supreme Court, in his appeal to original intent, he appeals to the text of the Constitution. Jefferson and Madison said together in 1825, ‘If you want to find the principles of the Constitution of the United States, you go first to the Declaration of Independence.’”  First, Jaffa means by the term “original intent” that the Constitution must be interpreted according to what it meant when it was originally adopted. It is a revolutionary and brilliant idea that will allow the Dominionists to effectively repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century. [43]     Secondly, if we take Jaffa and the Dominionists at their word and go to the Declaration of Independence, we can see just how radical the conservative revolution and Dominionism are. The only portion that is ever quoted publicly are these words:  “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,”  The quote stops in the middle of the sentence—the part that is never quoted is this:  “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”  Dominionism then, takes its authority to overthrow the government of the United States from our own Declaration of Independence. By the time all Americans wake up to the Dominionist’s intent, it may be too late.  Though Harry Jaffa speaks with a high minded sense of political righteousness, Shadia Drury exposes his Machiavellian side. Like Strauss, he “clearly believes that devious and illegal methods are justified when those in power are convinced of the rightness of their ends.”[44] Jaffa and Robertson saw eye to eye on more than one topic: for instance, Jaffa like his host Pat Robertson, found Oliver North to be a hero (and by extension Michael Ledeen) when both North and Ledeen went around the law to provide military aid to the contras.[45]   How Dominionism Stealthily Swept Over America   Within a period of twenty to thirty years beginning in the 1970’s, Dominionism spread like wild fire throughout the evangelical, Pentecostal and fundamentalist religious communities in America. It was aided and abetted by television and radio evangelists. More than any other man, Pat Robertson mobilized the millions of politically indifferent and socially despised Pentecostals and fundamentalists in America and turned them into an angry potent army of political conquerors.[46]  But it would be a mistake to limit Dominionism to the Pentecostals and fundamentalists alone: conservative Roman Catholics and Episcopalians have joined and enlarged the swelling numbers.[47] Robertson, like other media preachers, used every form of communication: television, radio, books and audio tapes available for sale. One book stands out. Originally published in 1982 and written with Bob Slosser, a key Robertson loyalist, Pat Robertson’s The Secret Kingdom soared on the bestseller charts. It underwent four printings during its first year. By 1984 Bantam published a mass paperback in cooperation with Thomas Nelson, the original publisher. (Though the book has since been revised, my quotes are from the original version.)  However, it was the Pentecostals and fundamentalists who made up the core of Robertson’s audience. To a people who were largely uneducated and who often remained ignorant even if they went through college because of their fear of becoming tainted by the “world and worldliness,” Dominionism came as a brilliant light that assuaged their deep sense of inferiority. Pentecostals in particular could take comfort from the notion that no longer would the world think of them as “Holy Rollers” who danced in the “Spirit” and practiced glossolalia. This time, they would be on top—they would be the head and not the tail—and the so-called elite, the educated of the world, would be on the bottom.  A new world was coming. To help the transition along, Pat Robertson, along with other pastors, evangelists and churchmen, founded schools, universities and colleges throughout the United States to train “Christians” how to run for office, how to win, and how to manage the affairs of government after they gained office. To get an idea of how successful the plan was, Robertson’s Regent University now has a $100 million endowment. After watching the Dominionists takeover the Republican Party and observing their ruthless methods, it is indeed apparent that Machiavellian principles are the fuel running their “How to Manual.”  Starting with a class of only twelve in 1985, Robertson began his Journalism Department at CBN University where 800 other graduate students were earning Master degrees in a fully accredited institution. Later Robertson changed the name of CBN University to “Regent University”—based on Dominionism’s teaching that the national government of America and governments of the world will be ruled by Dominionists, who will act as regents on an interim basis, that is, until the true King—Jesus Christ—will return to earth again and gratefully accept His Kingdom from the hands of His faithful regents.   The Dominionist Plan: Today Control the USA, Tomorrow the World   Significantly, Dominionism is a form of Social Darwinism.[48] It inherently includes the religious belief that wealth-power is a sign of God’s election. That is, out of the masses of people and the multitude of nations—wealth, in and of itself, is thought to indicate God’s approval on men and nations whereas poverty and sickness reflect God’s disapproval. The roots of the idea come from a natural twist of an Old Testament passage, which I discuss below. Essentially there were two elements necessary to establish Dominionism among Christians who previously believed helping the poor was a mandate of Christianity.[49]  First, Old Testament law had to be accepted as an essential part of a Christian’s theology.  Secondly, the Christian had to undergo a second conversion-like experience that went beyond being born again and demanded not only a commitment to reestablishing the Old Testament legal structure but required the implementation of that law in the nations of the world (including the U.S.) based upon a different understanding of the Great Commission (Matthew 28: 18-20).[50]  Under this concept Dominionists are to go into all the world to take dominion and “make disciples” teaching the disciples to “observe all” that Jesus “commanded.” All nations under Dominionist’s teaching are to convert to biblical laws, which are ranked superior to secular laws that were not God given or God directed and are found wanting. The Christian therefore must be willing to overthrow all laws that are secular.  In other words, a measure of one’s spirituality rested upon the individual’s willingness to accept the concept of taking dominion over not only the people of America, but taking dominion over the people of the entire world. From Dominionists’ actual words, the taking of America is perceived as a violent act. Ben Kinchlow who co-hosted CBN’s 700 Club with Pat Robertson told an audience, “We need to grab the American dream by the short hairs and snatch it back to where it was originally designed to be.”  As Robertson wrote approvingly in his book, The Secret Kingdom, the kingdom of heaven “suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.” He explained, “Zealous men force their way in. That’s what it means.” (Page 82.)   What “Dominion” Means   There were an estimated 110,000 Pentecostal and fundamentalist churches in America in the 1980s. Robertson taught them—through his vast television network and through his books—that the role of the Christian is to rule over the wicked. Dominionism’s purpose is to create theocrats (a Christian class of rulers). But in order to successfully place only certain Christians in positions of power, Dominionism divides Christian believers into classes based upon political ideology and certain hot point issues such as the privatization of Social Security and Medicare, freedom to decide on medical procedures with ones own physician, freedom of the press and freedom of speech, freedom of the arts, and certain rights like the right to a fair trial and protection from governmental intrusion into the privacy of marriage and adult associations.  The believers who are destined to rule are called the “elect,” and are separated from those believers who do not and will not accept the predestined superiority of the chosen ruling class. A Christian who raises his voice against the “elect” could be labeled a “false prophet or a dreamer of dreams,” and therefore, according to the Deuteronomic law “shall be put to death.”  Placing his own words in the mouth of God, Robertson wrote in The Secret Kingdom:  “It is clear that God is saying, ‘I gave man dominion over the earth, but he lost it. Now I desire mature sons and daughters who will in My name exercise dominion over the earth and will subdue Satan, the unruly, and the rebellious. Take back My world from those who would loot it and abuse it. Rule as I would rule.’” (p. 201.)  On his 700 Club television show (5-1-86) Robertson said:  “God’s plan is for His people, ladies and gentlemen to take dominion…What is dominion? Well, dominion is Lordship. He wants His people to reign and rule with Him…but He’s waiting for us to…extend His dominion…And the Lord says, ‘I’m going to let you redeem society. There’ll be a reformation….We are not going to stand for those coercive utopians in the Supreme Court and in Washington ruling over us any more. We’re not gonna stand for it. We are going to say, ‘we want freedom in this country, and we want power…’”  Charles Colson, the former Special Counsel to Richard Nixon, who was called “Nixon’s Hatchet Man,” pled guilty to charges in the Daniel Ellsberg case during the Watergate Scandal. He served a prison sentence, and started a prison ministry afterward. Pat Robertson has called him “the most brilliant political strategist in the world.” Over the years, Colson made many appearances on the 700 Club. On one occasion, he laid out the battle lines:  “It always has been a conflict between the kingdoms: the kingdom of God and the kingdom of man. When you really look at what Jesus is saying, He is saying the time is fulfilled, repent and believe, the kingdom is at hand. And He is calling for the kingdom of God to rule over the affairs of man. And so inevitably there’s going to be a conflict.” (The 700 Club 5-21-86)  Robertson said on his program the 700 Club (5-13-86):  “We’ve sat idly by long enough and said, ‘Well religion and politics don’t mix.’ Don’t you believe it. If we don’t have moral people in government then the only other people that can be in government are immoral. That’s the only way it goes. Either you have moral people in there or you have immoral people.”  On another show (5-7-86) he revealed a partial list of changes the Dominionists planned for America:  “We can change the government, we can change the court systems, we can change the poverty problem, we can change education…We can make a difference.”   Who Rules? And Who Are to Be the Ruled?   In an earlier section, I discussed the principle held by both Machiavelli and Leo Strauss that religion is necessary as a tool for a leader to control the masses. If conformity—not dissent is required, then religion is the power tool of choice, for it will insure a controlled populace. We’re about to examine its uses, its ingenious gifts and its powers, in this and the following sections. Be aware that Dominionism is in fact, a brilliantly executed road that leads to total power.  In his book, which tended to be more formal and less expansive, Pat Robertson began the listing of those Americans not fit for public office:  “Obviously the drunk, the drug addict, the lustful, the slothful do not have the discipline to rule the earth and to correct its evils.” (p. 82)  “If we remain unrighteous, the Bible says, we will miss the kingdom.” (p.83)  Then he quoted Paul’s epistle to the Corinthians:  “Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”(1 Corinthians 6:9-10) (p. 83)  If “Secular Humanists are the greatest threat to Christianity the world has ever known,” as theologian Francis Schaeffer claimed, then who are the Humanists? According to Dominionists, humanists are the folks who allow or encourage licentious behavior in America. They are the undisciplined revelers.  Put all the enemies of the Dominionists together, boil them down to liquid and bake them into the one single most highly derided and contaminated individual known to man, and you will have before you an image of the quintessential “liberal”—one of those folks who wants to give liberally to the poor and needy—who desires the welfare and happiness of all Americans—who insists on safety regulations for your protection and who desires the preservation of your values—those damnable people are the folks that must be reduced to powerlessness—or worse: extinction.  Dominionists determine who is among God’s elect—not solely by a religious experience such as being born again, but by a political determination of whether one is a Republican or a Democrat, a liberal or a conservative or simply a person who questions the deeds of Dominionist political figures. The politics of exclusion, including bigotry, is in fact wide spread throughout the United States.  Take, for instance, Sean Hannity’s remarks to Time Magazine, “You can play golf with liberals, be neighbors with them, go out to dinner. I just don’t want them in power.”[51] Or take Ann Coulter’s assertions: “Liberals have a preternatural gift for striking a position on the side of treason.” Or, “Whenever the nation is under attack, from within or without, liberals side with the enemy.” (It turns out that every single “liberal” in the country is a member of the Democratic Party and therefore is a traitor.)[52]  The Machiavellian nature of the Dominionist cult explains why Bill Clinton who is a Christian believer was attacked so viciously for his sexual folly but Newt Gingrich, Bill Livingston, Henry Hyde, Strom Thurmond and scores of other Republicans escaped the punishment of public ridicule, verbal abuse, and humiliation for the same sexual peccadilloes. (It appears only Democratic “liberals” must be held to the fire of biblical standards and biblical punishments because as we all know, they are “unregenerate from the beginning of time.”)  Robertson’s book acknowledges that his followers, the “Christian” army raised up for political purposes are the elect chosen to rule. Robertson’s transcribed television interviews and dialogs give shocking evidence to the legitimization of greed, hatred, violence and cruelty by members of the various fundamentalist branches of the American clergy and by elected officials of the Republican Party, which can be cited as evidence that Dominionism is not a Christian religion—that above everything else, Dominionism is synonymous with Machiavellianism: the ends justify the means. Under Dominionism, true Christianity is a target to destroy, not a goal to achieve.   Who Lives and Who Dies? How Justice Scalia Would Expand the Death Penalty   In one of those peculiar moments when a host on television seems to have a disconnect with his guest, I realized that Pat Robertson was using “code” with Herb Titus, his “guest” on the show on May 27, 1985. Titus was the Dean of CBN University’s School of Public Policy and was a known Christian Reconstructionist (Dominionist) who had written position papers arguing that government has exceeded its authority by requiring individuals such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers to be licensed by the state. Robertson, himself, revealed what the School of Public Policy was teaching on a later show (July 5, 1985). “What are we going to teach them? We’ll teach them the foundation of our government. We’re going to teach them how to win elections.”  This exchange with Titus occurred on May 27, 1985:  Robertson:  “We have with us today Constitutional authority, Herb Titus. Herb . . . . How about the biblical concept of war? You know there are many people who don’t think we should ever fight wars and yet we’re talking about brave men who died for freedom.” (Emphasis added)  Titus: “Well I believe the scripture is very clear that if you are attacked by evil whether within the country or outside the country, that it’s the duty of the civil authorities to defend the nation and the people of the nation from evil whether it comes from an aggressor outside or an aggressor inside. We can see that in Romans 13 for example.”  Curious about the meaning of what was being said, particularly since Robertson had asked a question about war, and Titus’ answer included war against one’s own population, I looked up Romans 13. I had always read this passage to be St. Paul’s concept of a good government providing beneficial services to the governed and I restricted its meaning to only a lawfully constituted government that rules justly.  But read Romans 13 in the light of Machiavelli’s and Leo Strauss’s discourses on religion and its uses by a political leader, and one glimpses the danger that Dominionism represents to the American people and to the American way of life. For it can be read to mean that any lawful government is ordained by God to execute retribution and punishment upon those who challenge (resist or rebel against) unjust policies of a government. When read this way, it takes on a new and sinister meaning. Or, it can be read to mean that once a new government of the United States of America has been established under biblical law—then no citizen will have the right to resist it or rebel against its edicts. In other words, the Declaration of Independence will no longer be applicable to the regency established by the Dominionists.  This is how Romans 13 reads in the New English Version:  “Every person must submit to the supreme authorities. There is no authority but by act of God, and the existing authorities are instituted by him; consequently anyone who rebels against authority is resisting a divine institution, and those who so resist have themselves to thank for the punishment they will receive. For government, a terror to crime, has no terrors for good behaviour. You wish to have no fear of the authorities? Then continue to do right and you will have their approval, for they are God’s agents working for your good. But if you are doing wrong, then you will have cause to fear them; it is not for nothing that they hold the power of the sword, for they are God’s agents of punishment, for retribution on the offender. That is why you are obliged to submit. It is an obligation imposed not merely by fear of retribution but by conscience. That is also why you pay taxes. The authorities are in God’s service and to these duties they devote their energies.”  This section, if taken literally as fundamentalists are apt to do, appears to prohibit any kind of resistance against the policies of a government, including peaceful protests, petitions, and writings. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia appears to endorse that position, for he quoted this same Romans 13 passage in his article, “God’s Justice and Ours,” to prove that Christian doctrine states “government—however you want to limit that concept—derives its moral authority from God.”[53] Government is not only the “minister of God” but it has the authority to “execute God’s wrath.”  The power of the sword is surely the power to kill or maim and certainly the power to intimidate. Scalia believes the power of the sword in this passage is “unmistakably a reference to the death penalty.”  At this point, Scalia demonstrates the absolute brilliance of the judicial rule created by neo-conservatives that requires a judge to determine the “original intent” of the writers of the Constitution. As Scalia himself describes it, “The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living but dead…It means today not what current society…thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted.”[54] Once the original thinking is determined, the judge can enforce the Constitution only as a document that is bound by the time zone in which a particular passage was written.  When I first read articles by authors who were exposing the Dominionists’ intention to extend the death penalty to cover “crimes” like adultery, rebelliousness, homosexuality, witchcraft or effeminateness, I found the death penalty extension goal to be laughable. It couldn’t be done in America.  I was wrong. I now realize that we are very close to seeing the Dominionists achieve their goal. All they need to do is to appoint a majority of judges who will adhere to the “dead Constitution” construction rule of Scalia (or what Harry Jaffa called “the original intent” construction rule). At the point when the Dominionist’s control the judiciary—that judiciary can roll back America’s body of legal jurisprudence to a century or more ago as Law Professor Patricia J. Williams pointed out.[55]  Scalia spilled the beans in his article, “God’s Justice and Ours” when he explained how he would determine whether the death penalty is constitutional or not. His reasoning goes like this: since the death penalty was “clearly permitted when the Eighth Amendment [which prohibits ‘cruel and unusual punishments’] was adopted,” and at that time the death penalty was applied for all felonies—including, for example, the felony of horse-thieving, “so it is clearly permitted today.”[56] Justice Scalia left no doubt that if the crime of horse stealing carried a death penalty today in the United States—he would find that law constitutional.  All a willing Dominionist Republican controlled congress need do to extend the death penalty to those people who practice witchcraft, adultery, homosexuality, heresy, etcetera, is to find those particular death penalty laws existing as of November 3, 1791, and re-instate them. No revolution is required. That’s why the battle over Bush’s judicial appointments is so crucial to the future of the America we know and love. And that’s why the clock is running out on freedom loving Americans.  Scalia himself appears to be a Dominionist, for he believes that Romans 13 represents the correct view— that government authority is derived from God and not from the people; he asserts his view was the consensus of Western thought until recent times. Like Pat Robertson, he laments that the biblical perspective was upset by “the emergence of democracy.”[57] Taking his cue from Leo Strauss, Scalia argued, “a democratic government, being nothing more than the composite will of its individual citizens, has no more moral power or authority than they do as individuals.” Democracy, according to Scalia, creates problems, “It fosters civil disobedience.”[58]  As Patricia Williams wrote: “God bless America. The Constitution is dead.”[59]   Dominionism’s Theocratic Views   What would a “reconstructed” America look like under the Dominionists?  K.L. Gentry, a Dominionist himself, suggests the following “elements of a theonomic approach to civic order,” which I strongly suggest should be compared to the Texas GOP platform of 2002, which reveals that we are not just talking about imaginary ideas but some things are already proposed on Republican agendas.[60] Dominionism’s concept of government according to Gentry is as follows:  “1. It obligates government to maintain just monetary policies ... [thus prohibiting] fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and deficit spending.  “2. It provides a moral basis for elective government officials. ...  “3. It forbids undue, abusive taxation of the rich. ...  “4. It calls for the abolishing of the prison system and establishing a system of just restitution. ...  “5. A theonomic approach also forbids the release, pardoning, and paroling of murderers by requiring their execution. ...  “6. It forbids industrial pollution that destroys the value of property. ...  “7. It punishes malicious, frivolous malpractice suits. ...  “8. It forbids abortion rights. ... Abortion is not only a sin, but a crime, and, indeed, a capital crime.”[61]  The fourth item in Gentry’s list, “abolishing of the prison system and establishing a system of just restitution” has been worked on extensively by Dominionist Gary North, who holds a doctorate degree in Economics. North has written volumes of books, essays and articles, (many of which falsely predicted that the year 2000 computer problem would bring down modern civilization.) He is most famous among Dominionists for reconciling economic theory with Old Testament passages.    Gary North describes the ‘just restitution’ system of the bible, which happens to reinstitute slavery, like this:  “At the other end of the curve, the poor man who steals is eventually caught and sold into bondage under a successful person. His victim receives payment; he receives training; his buyer receives a stream of labor services. If the servant is successful and buys his way out of bondage, he re-enters society as a disciplined man, and presumably a self-disciplined man. He begins to accumulate wealth.”[62]   The Immorality of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs   If the blithe acceptance of slavery isn’t shocking enough, here is one of the coldest attitudes I ever heard expressed in an interview on American television. I can’t help reading it in light of the coercive bullying tactics resorted to by Dominionist leaders in the House of Representatives to get the necessary votes to pass the controversial new Medicare Prescription Drug law.[63] The following interview reveals the deep seated hatred Dominionists have against governmental medical assistance to the elderly. The interview was conducted on August 1, 1985 with Dr. Walter Williams, professor of economics at George Mason University and author of thirty-five books. Danuta Soderman was a co-host on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club. She began the interview with a question about Medicare and Medicaid fraud, suggesting cost possibly “millions and billions” of dollars:  Williams: “Well, I think that the abuse and fraud in and of itself is a relatively minor problem. That is, the bigger problem is the whole concept of funding somebody’s medical care by a third party. And I might also mention here, that is, I saw in the audience many older and senior citizens. Now whose responsibility is it to take care of those people? I think it lies with their children and it also lies with themselves. That is, I think Christians should recognize that charity is good. I mean charity, when you reach into your pocket to help your fellow man for medical care or for food or to give them housing. But what the government is doing in order to help these older citizens is not charity at all. It is theft. That is, the government is using power to confiscate property that belongs to one American and give, or confiscate their money, and provide services for another set of Americans to whom it does not belong. That is the moral question that Christians should face with not only Medicare, Medicaid. But many other programs as well….Well, people should have insurance. But I would say if our fellow man is found in need, does not have enough, well that’s a role for the church, that’s a role for the family, that’s a role for private institutions to take care of these things.”  Danuta Soderman: “I thought it was interesting you talked about Medicare and Medicaid as not being a moral issue. A lot of people would think that to want to eliminate the program is rather uncompassionate—that there is something immoral about taking away something that people are relying so heavily upon, but you said that there is no moral issue here.”  Williams: “I think the moral issue runs the other way. That is, we have to ask ourselves, ‘What is the moral basis of confiscating the property of one American and giving it to another American to whom it does not belong for whatever reason?’ That is, I think we Americans have to ask ourselves is there something that can justify a legalized theft? And I think that even if the person is starving in the street that act, in and of itself, doesn’t justify my taking money from somebody else.”   How to Destroy the Social Security Program   On August 14, 1985, Pat Robertson unveiled his ingenious program on how to get rid of Social Security. The plan amazingly resembles sections of the Bush Administration’s Medicare Prescription Drug bill passed in December of 2003. Robertson, however, outlined what to do twenty years ago as follows:  1.  “We should say to all the elderly, ‘You’re going to be taken care of. The government’s going to pay you. Don’t worry about it. [You’ll] get your Social Security like you’re expecting, ‘cause you’re counting on it.”  2. “There should be a gradual moving [up] of [the retirement] age to reflect the fact that we’re healthier and we live longer and people should have dignity and be allowed to work a little bit longer.”  3. “The last thing we should do is to begin to let the younger workers slowly but surely go into private programs where the money is tax sheltered and over the years build up their own money and that would in turn, through the intermediary organizations, banks, insurance companies, would invest in American industry. They would buy plants and equipment, put people to work and it would help a tremendous boom. Imagine …$100 billion dollars a year flowing into American industry. It would be marvelous.”   Wealth is a Sign of God’s Favor, Poverty is a Sign of God’s Disfavor   How did the Dominionists get so far from the Lord’s edict to help the poor, the sick, and the elderly? Using the text of Deuteronomy 28, which is a list of God’s blessings and curses, Robertson and other Dominionists believe that the chapter reveals God’s covenanted economic law. God only bestows “material wealth or blessings” upon those who are among his elect and he does so because these are the individuals and nations who obey his commandments and laws. So what about the poor? Dominionist Gary North explains it this way:  'God is sovereign over the poor. He raises them up—not all of them, but some of them. ‘The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.’”[64]  I grant that the verse cited leaves government assistance out of the picture. North claims, the blessings and sanctions of Deuteronomy 28 are historical. He says, “They are predictable. Covenantal rebellion by a society will lead to God’s imposition of these sanctions.”[65] North then ties the package up neatly: “The blessings and cursings of God under the Mosaic Covenant were sure. They were not disconnected from God’s law. There was a bedrock objectivity that united covenant-keepers and covenant-breakers.”[66]  To understand what North is talking about, we have to read a portion of the text of Deuteronomy 28:  “The Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee…and the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath…”  A conclusion drawn by the scripture itself is that a nation who follows the commandments or laws of God will be “high above all nations of the earth…and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they shall be afraid of thee.” On the other hand, the Dominionists believe those who are poor, sick, and weak are so situated because God’s wrath has been visited upon them—they are the “wicked” of this earth and they deserve the wrath of God because their behavior is bringing the entire nation under condemnation.  The litany of the curses of God on those who do not keep his laws and commandments are among the most horrendous descriptions of torture in literature. Here is a sample from Deuteronomy 28:  “The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies…thy carcass shall be food unto all fowls of the air…The Lord will smite thee with [boils]…and with …tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. The Lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart [fear]; thou shalt grope at noonday; thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore…thou shalt betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein, and thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee; they sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them. Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand. The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall a nation whom thou knowest not eat up, and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always…”  Gary North explained: “The point of Deuteronomy 28 is this: the way to wealth, both individual and corporate, is through systematic adherence to God’s Bible-revealed law.”[67]  Hence the idea that should a nation minister to the poor or attempt to lift the poor out of poverty or save people from poverty and ill health, that nation is contravening the will of Almighty God and such legislation is contrary to the laws of God. It is only one step further to say that if this is God’s attitude toward the poor, it is morally wrong to help them. So it’s easy to see how Social Security and Medicare are viewed by Dominionists as “evil” programs that rob money from some citizens to enrich others.  There’s one other little trap for the unwary Dominionist; when a government is seen to be the enforcer of the Deuteronomic laws, it’s easy to take the next step and say that it is the duty of the “Christian” Dominionist government to subdue the wicked of the world, especially the vast American middle class, because its collective licentious life style is bringing the nation down as a whole; therefore the government must “minister the wrath of God” against the citizens of America as punishment for “rebelliousness.” That the entire scheme is an unending circular argument, escapes the notice of the rank and file sitting in the pews.  In their new role as ministers of God’s wrath against this nation, Dominionist political strategists are aware they must not be seen as being cruel and hateful. So at first, until the population is completely subdued and dominated by the elect, Dominionists are forced to devise laws that will create the political, social, and medical environment that will ultimately ensure that the wicked are punished—but it will appear—at first blush to be a gift. The truth, of course, according to Machiavellian/Straussian dictates, must be hidden from the population; not just once or twice, but over and over again.  In the end, Dominionism should be viewed as a backboard that bounces the New Deal and FDR’s social safety net programs, social security (as well as Medicare) into its political opposite: laissez-faire economics (the motto of 18th century French economists who protested excessive government regulation of industry.) Laissez-faire is a doctrine opposing governmental interference (as by regulation or subsidy) in economic affairs beyond the minimum necessary for the maintenance of peace and property rights. Dominionism opposes the licensing and regulating power of the government.  One last comment on Pat Robertson. On November 3, 1986, the 700 Club ran a piece on the use of computers in counting votes. Robertson ended his Perspective by saying there should be some kind of control on computer voting to assure an honest count. How prescient this man is! And how worrisome his prescience is.   Who Is on the Side of Freedom? Let Him Speak Now!   There is an infection, a religious and political pathology that has corrupted our churches. Those we trusted the most have embraced evil. That knowledge is almost more than we can bear. Who among us will stand in the gap and make up the hedge to save our nation?  When we look for help—for the wealthy leaders with the means to help rescue America, we find they have all defected to the Dominionists. They do not realize that if the middle class of America is wiped out—there will be no one to buy their cars, their computers or their products. Only one or two brave souls like George Soros have made massive contributions to combat the think tanks and the organized political machine of the Dominionists. The corporate press lies sleeping, not realizing they will be allowed to report only what they are instructed to report.  Freedom is under siege. There is only one free major political party still left in America. I know the Democrats look chaotic, unfocused and generally unsmooth and thank God, unprogramed. Make no mistake, these plain ordinary citizens are holding the candles that together form the great torch of liberty. For all their faults, they love America and they love freedom and they love the Bill of Rights. America’s independents, its true Conservatives, its sensible Republicans, and its Libertarians must join hands together with the homely Democrats and take back America for all Americans.  The livelihood of the working people of America is at stake. The Dominionists have lost more American jobs in the last three years than since the days of Herbert Hoover. And now they want to eliminate the minimum wage laws too. America’s unions have helped to create a better life for millions of workers. The Dominionists want to break all unions apart (especially the teacher’s union). As Americans, we love our schools and are proud of our educational system. The Dominionists want to destroy all public education in America and force Americans to be educated in their religious schools. Americans love our culture and the arts. The Dominionists want to destroy that culture.  The election of 2004 is not just another election. It is the battle of the century. It is the gravest political war since the Civil War, which if lost, spells the end of Independence Day and every right in the Bill of Rights that we have fought so hard to preserve. Is there an American, regardless of his or her party, who would not fight for our Democracy? It’s in jeopardy now. Our friends and cousins in Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand and scores of other nations have seen our jeopardy and have been crying out for months and days and years to wake up America!  Let me see your face and look into your eyes. Let me hear you say, “There is no difference between the two parties.” May God help us and grant us discernment when we vote.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Notes to The Despoiling of America  [1] “Religious Right Finds Its Center in Oval Office,” Washington Post, December 24, 2001.

This is the product of a conspiracy that has been growing over the past few decades through the use of evil tactics and strategies, lies and deceptions to transform America.  “Deception is now the hallmark of the Bush administration. Read of the frightening chicanery in furthering an imperial strategy, nurturing the military-industrial complex, waging war on the environment, plunging the nation into debt, demeaning the needy, antagonizing the world and using terrorism to frighten and exploit.”  The author calls on patriots to apply the principles of democracy now to retake America from a conservative elite that controls the country.

[12] See Joan Bokaer’s article in “The Rise of the Religious Right in the Republican Party,” a public information project from TheocracyWatch.org  http://www.4religious-right.info/taking_over.htm  [13] Ben Kinchlow, co-host of the 700 Club with Pat Robertson, was made Vice President of CBN in charge of CBN’s charities program “Operation Blessing.” On March 27, 1985, while criticizing farmers for wanting a government bailout he said: “What’s wrong in this country is that so many people have substituted the government for God. Instead of looking to God to supply their needs, they’re looking to government.” Railing at financially stressed people was very common on the show.  [14] Tim LaHaye predicted on Pat Robertson’s 700 Club show on September 25, 1985 that 110,000 evangelical, fundamentalist, and Pentecostal churches could sponsor one person per church to run for office and win, that in a decade they would hold every office in the U.S. At the time, he said there were only 97,000 public offices in the U.S. so “we would have more Christians in office than there are positions.” By 1994, for the first time in forty years, Republicans regained control of Congress. Similarly Ralph Reed predicted that by the year 2,000 they would control Congress. Gary North wrote in 1985: “I propose a program. Some variant of this program must be adopted if we are to have any meaningful hope in recapturing the machinery of civil government, the media, and the educational institutions. It will be done. It has already begun. How long it will take is problematical; I think we will begin to see major victories before the year 2005.” http://reformed-theology.org/ice/books/conspiracy/html/8.htm at page 5 of 11 pages.  [15] Francis Schaeffer originally appeared on the 700 Club with Pat Robertson in 1982. The series of interviews with Schaeffer were repeated on the show in the week of July 7, 1986 as Robertson presented the legal and biblical foundations for Christian political action. Francis Schaeffer, however, died between the first and second airing. The Schaeffer interviews were tape recorded and transcribed, my quotes are from my transcript. The accuracy of my transcript can be compared to the video tapes of the shows. At the time, People for the American Way was recording the shows and establishing a Pat Robertson 700 Club library for future reference.  [16] All 700 Club quotes in this article were recorded and transcribed by the author and her assistant unless otherwise indicated.  [17] Although neither Robertson nor Schaeffer used the words “Dominionism” or “dominion” in this interview series they used the word “dominant” when asking which culture was dominant in the United States: the Christian culture or the humanistic culture. They asserted the humanistic culture was the dominant force in America and “Christians” had to regain dominance.  [18] The most successful ministers knew the psychological importance of creating “enemies” that were attacking the church. Jerry Falwell maintains the rule: “To be successful, keep a good fight going all the time.”  [19] Psychiatrist Scott Peck has written about the phenomena groups resort to almost universally in his book, The People of the Lie, “There are profound forces at work within a group to keep its individual members together and in line...Probably the most powerful of these group cohesive forces is narcissism…group pride….A less benign but practically universal form of group narcissism is what might be called ‘enemy creation,’ or hatred of the ‘out-group.’”  [20] “War on Secular Society” at http://www.4religious-right.info/introduction2.htm  [21] In short, they needed a religion of their own to justify evil acts and to counter the political acceptance by many Christians who were attracted to the communal and “communistic” principles of the early church (Acts 2:42-47), where the early Christians sold all their possessions, gave them to the needy, and held “all things [in] common.” Such Christian ideas were a direct threat to capitalism’s future robber barons. How could great fortunes be amassed if one had to give it all away to the poor and follow Jesus? (Matthew 19:16-30.)  [22] Pat Robertson is particularly adept at changing the issue from questioning an aggressively religious political agenda into an attack on religion. The Constitution prohibits a religious test for office in America (Article 6). However, a battle over the nomination of Herb Ellingwood in 1985 to the position of Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy caused a fire storm. (That office screens candidates for the federal judiciary.) During the same period dominionists like Ellingwood and Tim LaHaye were advocating that twenty-five percent of all government positions should be handed to Christian fundamentalists (dominionists) since they made up twenty-five percent of the nation’s population. Pat Schroeder, former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and chairman of the Civil Service Committee strongly opposed the view as a religious quota system and a violation of Article VI of the Constitution. She said the questions that were asked of judicial candidates, apparently prepared by Ellingwood, amounted to a religious test for office. She spoke on the Phil Donahue show on (September 6, 1985):  “If you look at some of the questions that are being asked by some of the senators of judges, they don’t have to do with their background, their training, whether or not they understand the law, they have to do with personal beliefs. That’s not where we have been in the past, and that’s a very dangerous turn…”  During the same period of time (August-September) Pat Robertson easily turned the legitimate questioning of Herb Ellingwood’s agenda into an attack on Christianity by framing it this way on his 700 Club Show on August 9, 1985:  “Can an evangelical Christian hold high office in the United States of America? Now that is the question. Or are evangelical Christians going to be discriminated against? And indeed will there be a religious test for public office which disqualifies anybody who speaks to a religious group? . . . .Herb Ellingwood is Chairman right now of the Merit Protection Review Board and he has done a superb job. He was the former legal counsel to President Reagan in California and has worked closely with Ed Meese for years. He’s been a very distinguished attorney. It just seems like this campaign of assassination that goes on against good men like that should be brought to a stop. . .And if you feel that Christians ought to be allowed to serve in positions of responsibility in the government…and you don’t think that Christians should be discriminated against…here’s the number of the White House: 202 446-7639…” (700 Club 8-9-85)  [23] One cannot help comparing this passage with the fact that 27,000 bombs were dropped on Iraq in the 2003 air war and in a demonstration of cold indifference, the Bush administration ignored the advice of prominent archeologists to protect Iraq’s museums, which contained the greatest collection of ancient relics, art, and ancient treasures in the world, and in so doing, allowed the looting—the despoiling—of that nation’s treasures.  [24]Again, because we will learn in this article that Machiavelli is a handbook in the Bush administration, one must ask if the George W. Bush administration perceives despoiling as a plan of action to control the American populace. The question must be asked.  [25] See Kevin Phillips, author of American Dynasty, Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush. Viking Press, 2004, at page 239-240.  [26] Ibid. at page 321.  [27] Robertson’s and Ledeen’s relationship continues.  For a recent CBN interview of Ledeen conducted by Pat Robertson and transcribed by CBN.com go to: http://cbn.com/CBNNews/News/030623e.asp?option=print  [28] Ledeen tried to arrange the sale of arms to Iran in order to divert the profits to the Contra militants who were fighting the Nicaraguan government’s Sandinistas. However, Congress had voted to cut off U.S. aid to the Contras and therefore any such transaction was illegal.  [29] William O. Beeman’s article, “Who Is Michael Ledeen?” was published on May 8, 2003 and may be read at the alternet.org: http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=15860  [30] Gerard Thomas Straub worked at CBS for eight years before joining the 700 Club as executive producer. After leaving CBN’s employment, he went to work for ABC’s “General Hospital” as associate producer. His 1986 book, Salvation for Sale, (Prometheus Books, N.Y.) offers insights to how Pat Robertson conducted business off camera from the perspective of an insider. The dichotomy between his public friendly “pastoral” role and his actual business conduct is stark evidence that he understood Machiavelli’s rule that only appearance counts. Straub wrote: “In reality Pat is a pompous pope of the video Vatican of Christian broadcasting, and he rules his empire with absolute authority. He does not tolerate debate, discussions, or dissent…His television followers never get to see the tough-minded, hard-driving cut-throat leader.” In addition, over the years, Pat Robertson revealed his Machiavellian political philosophy repeatedly and openly on his show in discussions of how to handle foreign policy and in his ruthless approach to the poor and needy of America.  [31] On June 19, 1985: Danuta Soderman, the second member of Pat Robertson’s daily team, asked Pat Robertson how the United States should deal with middle-east terrorist groups: “Speaking about being decisive in dealing with terrorists’ groups, yesterday you offered some opinion on how Iran should be one of the places we should target our energies on, any other thoughts on this?  Robertson: “Just like the last guest in that clip our news department did, he said it’s pretty much undeclared war. Khomeini has declared war against the United States. He has told people that if they die against the infidel, they go to heaven. The Islamic Jihad is controlled out of Iran, and the other factor of course is Syria, which is giving some sanctuary to all of these people. Syria controls the Becca Valley now— practically all of it, since Israel withdrew its forces. So up in the Becca Valley the Shiite Muslims from Iran are forcing the Lebanese women to wear veils and practice the various extreme views of the Islamic faith in the Shiite traditions. We’ve got to go after the source. If you want to go after a snake you don’t cut inches off his tail.”  Robertson also focused on the Becca Valley on July 12, 1985 and on several other occasions. The refrain has not changed in nineteen years. A recent January 2004 article published in the Jerusalem Post states Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is considering invading the Becca Valley, which is still controlled by Syria.

[39] The only example of this possibility I have found so far is in the work of Dominionist Gary North who wrote tirelessly on the correlations between conservative economic principles and the Old Testament laws and rules. See Gary North, “The Covenantal Wealth of Nations,” from Biblical Economics Today, Vol. XXI, No 2, February/March 1999.

For instance, Gary North has written volume after volume deriving principles of economics from his studies of the Pentateuch.”  [40] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 11-13.  [41] Shadia Drury is quoted in an analysis by Jim Lobe for the Inter Press Service News Agency. http://www.ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=18038  [42] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 23.  [43] I’m indebted to Patricia J. Williams, Professor of law at Columbia University for this insight. See her article, “Infallible Justice,” The Nation; October 7, 2002 at http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20021007&s=williams   Not only is the concept of “original intent brilliant and revolutionary, it in fact goes further than any other political format to legitimize the conversion of present day jurisprudence back to the judicial weltanschauung (world view) of eighteenth century jurists. It is the key factor in the Dominionist’s intent to establish biblical law over all Americans. Two Supreme Court justices subscribe to it already. In other words, as Law Professor Patricia J. Williams has pointed out, the rule would effectively repeal most of the judicial decisions made in the last century.  [44] Shadia Drury, Leo Strauss and the American Right, St. Martin’s Press, 1999 at page 106.  [45] Ibid.  [46] See the excerpts from my book, The New Messiahs which trace the political machinations of the Dominionists within the Republican Party and the plot to take over all three branches of the government of the United States.  [47] J. Ligon Duncan, III “Moses Law for Modern Government: The Intellectual and Sociological Origins of the Christian Reconstructionist Movement,” Premise, Vol. II Number 5, May 27, 1995. http://capo.org/premise/95/may/ssha2.html.  [48] Social Darwinism is the discredited extension of Darwin’s evolutionary theory to the human social condition. Social Darwinism takes Charles Darwin’s concept, “the survival of the fittest,” and applies it to the idea that the ladder to material wealth and to the “good life” may be climbed only after one has successfully engaged in group battles and conflicts and prevailed in the pit of life by drop kicking one’s opponents. Those who climb out of the pit and up the ladder become the socially recognized victors in the competition and are considered biologically superior to those who fail. The illogical fallout from this concept is the circular argument that the existence of a socially elite class must be proof that those who possess wealth and power are necessarily superior to those in economic classes below them.  [49] Dominionists may argue with some credibility that they do believe in helping the poor; however, they want churches to undertake that task and adamantly fight against government social aid programs funded from tax monies—unless of course—it is a so-called “faith based” initiative. Pat Robertson forgot his objections to the government handing out money and gratefully accepted the $500,000 Mr. Bush sent him early in his administration for “good faith based charitable work.” Regardless of their protestations, however, the churches of America cannot and do not have the billions of dollars to provide the social safety net for the poor, elderly and sick among America’s population. In 1985, for example, Robertson bragged CBN gave $50 million worth of food, clothes, and supplies to 8.5 million people, but that was what he called “leveraged” contributions, in which CBN had joined with other charities. Robertson admitted they gave only $10 million. Deducting the $2 million of CBN’s contributions to the Contras in Central America, CBN’s total contribution amounted to only about eighty-eight cents to every hungry, needy person he said CBN helped.  [50] Pat Robertson wrote in The Secret Kingdom: “Unhappily, evangelical Christians have for too long reduced the born-again experience to the issue of being ‘saved.’ Salvation is an important issue, obviously, and must never be deemphasized. But rebirth must be seen as a beginning, not an arrival. It provides access to the invisible world, the kingdom of God, of which we are to learn and experience and then share with others. Jesus Himself said it clearly before His ascension: ‘All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.’ [Matthew 28:18-20 New American Standard Bible]. The commission was to make followers and learners—converts—and to teach them the principles of the kingdom. Entry into the body of believers was not enough. They were to learn how to live in this world…The invisible was to rule the visible. Christ has authority over both.” Emphasis is Robertson’s.

"             Matthew Billings had known Alan Shore for years. Not a large number of years, but enough to be able to consider himself an old friend. Matthew knew Alan to be a lot of things; arrogant, brilliant, manipulative, foolish, even. But Matthew had never known Alan Shore to be a fool. That is, until now.  Don't get me wrong, mused Billings, I like Sally. A lot. Billings had even considered exploring that territory, at one time. Sally is a nice girl, sexy, sweet and a lot of fun. Helluva rack, too. All of that hid her intelligent legal mind and hard work. Matthew really liked Sally. But, let's face it. She was not Tara. Tara Wilson was deep, classy and enchanting. Tara was loyal and intelligent, a woman of substance. Billings thought that her cool, classy exterior must be hiding a heat that one could only imagine. He'd bet a year's salary that she was a fire goddess in bed. The fact that Alan chose to play with Sally, instead of drowning in the depths of Miss Wilson, made Matthew consider the idea that Shore was, as others accused, deeply disturbed.   Across the table, in the crowded bar, Alan sipped his Scotch and glanced at his watch. Matthew dragged him down here to talk, and had not said a word after ordering his drink. Alan had to meet Sally for dinner in an hour, and was growing impatient. Talk, Matthew, he thought. It had been a rough day. Rough week. Rough year.  Matthew liked to think of himself as a loyal and noble friend. He would never snake in on Alan's territory. He would never go out with Tara. He was not that kind of guy. Besides, she turned him down when he asked her out the first week she came to work there. Sweetly said something about workplace complications, etc, none of it bought by Billings. She was not into him. No problem.   'Is there something on your mind, Matthew, or is this some kind of telepathy exercise?' asked Alan. 'Well, I wanted to talk to you about Tara.'  Alan's eyes narrowed. Tara was a very sore subject with him at the moment. Although he recognized that he was the one who cut off the exploration of a relationship with her, he was also unhappy over the graceful and mature way that Tara had dealt with his decision. Not really that he wanted to cause her pain, but a few tears and some mild histrionics would have gone a long way to boost his ego. It would have also given him hope that she was pining for him. He liked to think of the lovely Tara, home alone, eating a solitary meal, soaking reflectively in a bubble bath, lying naked in her bed with damp tendrils of hair curled on her pillow, longing for him.  'Alan' barked Matthew.  'Yes, of course,' Alan reassured, wiping out the image of the sheets wrapped around Tara's long legs, but not without considerable effort.  'Of course, what?' 'What you were saying.' Matthew shook his head. He never mistook Alan for Denny Crane before, but maybe...  'Alan, pay attention. I am trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with you?' 'That could take some time,' Alan drawled, 'Is there a particular flaw of mine that concerns you?' 'Let's start with your questionable taste in women,' Billings said, 'Sally is a fun girl, and I like her a lot, but she is not Tara.' 'Good to know.' 'Don't be an ass, Alan. If you could have either, why would you choose Sally? I am really trying to understand.'  Alan glared at Billings. Nosy little bastard. What did he want him to say? I am playing with Sally because she makes me feel young and free? Or that his past misdeeds were not in her mind, and he had nothing to prove to her? How about that the girl was hot and he simply wanted to have a good time with someone who would be too busy screwing his brains out to want to examine his psyche?   Alan signaled the waitress for a fresh drink. Matthew declined.  'I like the girl, Matthew. We see eye to eye on things.' 'Like?' 'Like having fun and not taking things so seriously. Every, single, little thing does not need analyzing and talking about until it dies a horrible death. Tara is too...' Alan trailed off, and took a long sip of his new drink. 'What? Intelligent? Beautiful? Knowledgeable about you? Clear? Honest? Perceptive?' Matthew was getting warmed up. 'All of the above. And...complicated.' Alan looked tired then, and older than his years. Matthew felt instant sympathy. What a rough year for Alan. But, then, he brought most of it on himself.  'You are making a mistake, Alan. Tara is good for you.' 'WHAT...good for me?' Alan slammed his glass down hard enough to cause several heads to turn. 'Why do I need that? I just want to go out with a woman who is going to take me as I am and have fun. Is that a crime? I like Sally. She is smart and funny and sexy and she likes me. So there.' Alan drained his drink and stood to leave. Tossing bills on the table, he turned to go.  'Butt out, Matthew. I am a big boy. I know what I want.' 'So you don't mind if I ask Tara out?' Matthew bluffed, gamely. Alan's eyes flashed, instinctively, at Billings.   Then the mask fell.  'Do what you want. That is what I intend to do.' Alan turned and left. Matthew let out a breath. For that brief second, he thought Alan would swing at him. No, this is not over yet, Matthew grinned as he finished his drink.   Not even close, pal.   Shore strolls into work the next morning, fairly happy with life. After the drinks with Matthew, he and Sally had enjoyed a casual dinner, a casual movie, and some casual tongue wrestling in his car. Alan smiled. Necking in a car in front of a girlÂs house made him feel like a kid again. He walked into the conference room where Sally, Tara, Matthew and Denny waited. He settled in, giving Tara a slight nod and Sally a smile that bordered on a well-heeled leer. Denny Crane began by congratulating himself on securing Clay International as a new corporate client for the firm. He said that the owner and CEO would be in this morning and that they are a VIP client. He assigned Alan to evaluate their tax position and Sally to check their contracts, forms and the like. And Tara, he said, I want you to act as Mr. Clay's personal liaison here. I want him to feel that he can call you and you will take care of his needs. This caused a sarcastic snort from Alan, who quickly wiped the smirk of his face.  The door opened to the conference room and in walked a man of about 30, who smiled at the assembled group. He was not just handsome, thought Sally, he was devastating. She hoped Alan could not read her thoughts.  He could. She turned from the bright light of the stranger's smile to look at Alan, watching her from across the table. Be cool, she thought. Think cool. Snow, icicles, martinis...not working. Alan was not fooled. He turned his gaze to Tara.  Quivering.  The woman was actually quivering.  Shore was taken aback.  Tara?  The ideal princess of cool was fluttering her lashes like a drunken prom queen.  Shore was amazed, and more than a little unhappy.  Who the hell WAS this bozo?  Sean Clay was not impervious to the reaction that he got from women.  He just liked to get past it so that he could take care of business.  He glanced at Sally, mentally noting the open gaze and seductive clothing of the attractive girl.  Unprofessional clothes, he thought, nice rack.  Turning to Tara, he found more to interest him.  Gorgeous, he noted, what was with the uniform look?  He tried to imagine her in clothing more befitting such a beauty.  Or none at all.  Nothing flickered on his face, just a genuine smile.  He nodded at the introductions all around.  Billings was good, seemed friendly.  Shore.  Why did Sean feel that Alan Shore was looking at him as an enemy might?  Crane was urging him to have a seat.  Sean declined Tara's offer of coffee with a smile.  Shore was reclining back in his seat, arms crossed, head tilted.  This is going to be interesting.  Sean began outlining the scope of his company.  It was impressive, one of the largest corporate travel services in the country.  Where other companies had faltered after 9/11, Clay's prospered.    'So,' said Alan, 'did your father leave the company to you?' 'No,' replied Sean easily, 'my father died when I was 4, I built the company from the ground up.  On my own'  Sean noted the instant look of sympathy from Crane, Sally and Tara.  Shore just looked annoyed, Billings amused.  At what?  Clay could not imagine. 'A self made man,' Crane intoned seriously, 'I admire that.' 'Well, I have good people who work for me, I am fortunate to have them,' said Sean, modestly.  Ass, thought Shore.  Self made, I bet.  Between Sally's heaving breasts and Tara's doe-eyed stare, Shore was certain he was going to be sick.  'Well, son, I hope that you are free tonight,' said Crane, 'I would love to have you as our guest for dinner.' 'That is very generous of you, Mr. Crane, but I would hate for people to change plans on account of me.'  'Nonsense, my boy, we will be happy to have you.  All of us,' Crane looked around the table.  'Do you need to call your wife?' 'I am not married, sir.' Sean offered mildly.  Shore thought that Tara's eyes widened just a touch.   'Or perhaps you have a partner?' Shore said lightly, 'Of either gender.  They are certainly welcome.  We are a very progressive firm, aren't we, Denny?'  Crane looked at Shore like he had suddenly grown a second head. Of course, he stammered, in obvious discomfort.  'No worry there.  I have no partner.  And I only date women.'  Sean said, amused by Shore's obvious dislike.  'Such is life,' said Shore. After more talking and more of Crane's butt kissing, Sean Clay rose to leave.  He told Crane that he would have his assistant call for information regarding the restaurant for the evening.  He shook hands all around, and Shore was certain that he saw him linger holding Tara's hand a few extra seconds.  Billings saw it, too.    They all walked out, heading to their respective offices, except Tara, who escorted Sean to the door.  'I do hope that I will see you again this evening,' Sean said quietly. 'Of course,' replied Tara, 'I will be there.'  As Sean Clay walked down the hall, with his expensive suit cut to perfectly fit his athletic form, Tara felt like slapping herself.  What is wrong with me?  Just yesterday, I was sad over Alan's rejection and now I feel like I was hit by the proverbial thunderbolt.  Tara shook her head.  Can I really be that fickle?  She was a bit shamed at her reaction to this man.  It was not love at first site.  Her heart was still occupied by the reluctant Shore.  What was this?  Be honest, Tara, she thought, you know what iletcherousust.  Pure and simple.  For all of her admonishing of Alan for his lecherous ways at the old firm, and her pretense of revulsion, here she was, lusting after a total stranger.  Get back to work, Tara, she thought.    She picked up the files for the Murphy tax case and took them into Alan's office.  He glanced up from the notes he was writing, nodding as she laid the files on his desk.  She turned, wordlessly to go, thinking how difficult it was for them to even talk to each other these days.  She missed their easy banter.  'Tara,' Alan said, leaning back into his chair, 'would you mind closing the door?  I have something that I would like to discuss with you.'  Tara walked over and gently closed the door, returning to stand in front of Alan's desk.  Usually, before their little recent talk where Alan explained about his choice of Sally over her, they would sit together on the couch, and talk like friends.  But, today, Alan was maintaining the space of his desk between them.    'Tara,' Alan said, in his best authoritative voice, 'I am very concerned about you.' 'Really?' Tara's eyebrows lifted, 'I'm mildly flattered.  Whatever for?' 'Tara, I blame myself in a way,' Alan began, 'I mean, after all of those months of flirting with you and coming on to you, I am sure that you were devastated by my sudden change of heart.'  Tara was positive that he must have been using some sort of hallucinogens.  Or she was.  Surely he was not going there? 'Devastated?' 'Well, upset, perhaps,' Alan conceded. 'Hmmmm.' 'Anyway, I feel a...responsibility for you.  And to you.  As a friend.  I am concerned that on the rebound of this unfortunate infatuation that you had for me, you might do something less than circumspect.'  Alan smiled at her as one might a child contemplating a tantrum.  'Like what?' Tara said, not sure whether to laugh or slap that smirk off his face.  'Like falling for the first pretty male object to come along.  Like making a spectacle of yourself in some unbecoming way.'  Slap, she thought, we are headed towards a slap.  Whatever was he talking about?  Then, the clarity hit her.  Sean Clay.  He saw her attraction to the handsome, younger CEO.  Jealous.  That was it.  Tara had to stifle a laugh and worked at maintaining a blank expression.  'Do you think that I have behaved in some manner that was unprofessional, Mr. Shore?'  said Tara, her accent becoming more clipped and pronounced. 'Oh, don't worry, Tara, I am sure that no one noticed it but me,' Alan reassured her, 'I just happen to know you so well that I noticed your flirting with the client today.  Most inappropriate.'  Shore sounded like a principal at a school. 'I'm sorry you were offended,' Tara said evenly. 'I was not, but the client could have been.  That would be embarrassing for you, and I care about you far too much to allow that to happen.  After all, do you think that the CEO of a Fortune 500 company is going to involve himself with a paralegal?  I mean, you are lovely in your little...uniform...but this is a man who can have the most stunning women on Earth.  I would just hate to see you get your hopes up and be crushed again.'  Alan smiled.  Fighting the overwhelming urge to throw Alan Shore out of a window, Tara decided to give as good as she got. 'I think Sally found him attractive.' Nice shot, thought Shore to himself.   'I suppose that many women do.'  Shore sounded bored. 'Well, he is young, and very handsome, rich, successful, charming...' Tara listed. 'Yes, yes, but we are not discussing him.  We are discussing you.  Perhaps, Tara, you should consider a hiatus from dating or romantic entanglements for a while.  Give yourself some time to heal, so that you can make better choices. '  Sanctimonious pig, Tara thought, talking to me about better choices?  This was really too much.  That egomaniacal degenerate is going to lecture me about romance and proper decorum?  I don't think so.  Tara geared up for the fight.    'That is something to consider,' she said quietly, 'I have found men to be rather...disappointing, lately.  They just never turn out to be all the man that I believe them to be.'  Alan's eyes flickered almost imperceptivity at that shot.  Torn between the urge to return fire or grab Tara and kiss her breathless, he chose the less dangerous path.  'There, you see, you are too emotional for rational decisions about romance and sex at this time.  You need a break.'    'Perhaps.  I will certainly give your advice all of the attention and consideration that it deserves.'  Tara flipped her hair back behind her shoulder, 'Is there anything else?'  'No...yes...I wanted to tell you that if you want to forego this dinner tonight, I can make your excuses to Denny and the client.  It may make things easier on you,'  Alan said solicitously.    'How sweet of you, but I promised to be there.  I will try to muddle through.  I hope I have something appropriate to wear, besides this uniform.'    'You would be lovely in anything,' said Alan truthfully, 'just remember to be appropriate and restrained.'  'Thank you ever so much, Alan.  I am so touched by your concern for me.' Alan smiled magnanimously.   'I am your friend, Tara, a mentor really.  I have a responsibility.'  Choking down the laughter that threatened to bubble out, Tara hurried out of Alan's office.  She made it to her desk before she allowed a chuckle.  What an ass.    Denny Crane walked to Tara's desk, looking for the Kepler file.  Tara sweetly asked if she might take the afternoon off.  When Crane looked like he might refuse, Tara whispered something about female problems, which was enough to propel Crane into immediate, uncomfortable agreement.  As Crane walked away, Tara contemplated Alan Shore's closed door.  You are in for some trouble, Mr. Shore, she thought.    Alan took Sally's coat and handed it to the coat check girl.  Pocketing the ticket, he turned to Sally.  She looked very pretty, Alan thought, in a very young way.  Her lavender dress was ruffled, with a generous amount of cleavage.  With her strapped pumps, curly hair and jeweled butterfly hairclip, Alan thought she looked like a pretty child.  A child built like a brick...never mind, he thought.  Let's get on with this, he mused, as he escorted Sally to the table that already had Crane, Matthew and Sean Clay seated at it.  The three men rose, and Alan gallantly pulled out Sally's chair.  As she bent to sit, all three of the men at the table were treated to a clear view of her generous breasts.  Alan raised an eyebrow to Billings.  'Is Tara not here, yet?'  Alan asked, thinking that maybe she did take his advice after all. 'No, not yet,' said Matthew. 'I hope that she is alright,' said Sally, with genuine concern.  She really did like Tara, and held no bad feelings for the romantic stuff that had gone on.   'I am sure she is fine.' Alan said, soothingly, absently.  Alan worried that Tara had, indeed, had a problem finding something to wear.  He had never seen her in anything but casual or business clothes.  'She is probably just primping, as you ladies are prone to do.'  Alan sat next to Sally, with his back to the door.  He hated that, it must be some male need, but he liked to be able to see the door.    'There she is.'  Shore heard Sally say.  He looked up to see Crane, Billings and Clay all staring at the door with expressions of surprise, delight and lust.  Sally was smiling, waving at the door.  Alan turned to greet the arriving Tara.  A heart attack, he thought.  Or, maybe a stroke.  Yes, that's it, a stroke.  That must be what I am feeling.  He watched Tara step down the stairs and glide across the carpet.  Her soft, lush hair was gathered up in a loose chignon, with numerous wavy locks escaping to caress her swan neck and soft cheeks.  Diamonds on her ears, her makeup smoky, but understated, with soft rose shine on her lush lips.  Her sparkling eyes were framed by lashes dark and thick.  As she walked to the table, he watched her long legs move effortlessly on high-heeled golden sandals.  Her whisper of a dress had a modestly high neck that banded around her tiny throat.  The clinging golden, gossamer fabric caressed every curve, appearing to be transparent, but it was a mere illusion.  As she turned to greet Crane, Alan saw that the demure front of the dress belied the open back that exposed an expanse of soft, golden skin, right down to the small of her back, at the top of her heart-shaped derriere. Every curve, every long, elegant line of her body was somehow covered, and yet exposed.  Alan turned to see Matthew and Sally both looking at him, amused.  Alan sat down, after Tara did, grateful that the table hid his instant physical reaction to her stunning appearance.  Finally, with the sound of blood pounding in his ears, he felt controlled enough to turn and look at her again.  Tara turned to look at Alan, and she smiled the bewitching smile of a woman who knows just exactly how beautiful she is.  Alan had an immediate, uncontrollable, animal urge to sweep the table clean and throw her across it, climb on top of her and make love to this golden goddess in front of him.  Her perfume hit him.  A stroke.  I am dying.  All of this turmoil was happening inside him, but his face showed no trace of it.  Sally was not perceptive enough, did not know him well enough.  Crane was barely coherent on his best days.  Clay was not even looking at him.  He was smiling at Tara.  But Matthew knew.  Alan wanted to punch Billings for the merriment on his face.    'Tara,' said Sean Clay, 'you look ravishing.'  Alan turned to see Tara gracefully smile at the compliment.  Ordering, small talk and eating seemed to rush by to Shore.  He barely ate, only drinking wine for the most part.  He was uncharacteristically quiet, even reserved.  He talked to Sally, and everyone else, only when asked.  He was too busy watching Tara and Sean, in that dance of growing attraction.  In that moment, he knew that he had made a mistake of epic proportions.  He would have bared his psyche and let her analyze him for hours; he would have even talked about his mother, anything, to have another chance at this.  Oh, God, he thought.  I am a fool.  After coffee, Clay rose out of his chair and asked Tara to dance.  The band was playing standards, and Shore watched her walk out to the floor, watched Sean put his arms around her, his hand resting lightly on the small of her back.  If I had a gun, Alan thought, as Sally asked him if he wanted to dance.  Robotically he agreed.  With Sally's sweet softness against him, dancing, Shore tried to focus on the woman whose head was resting on his shoulder.  What a sweet girl, he thought.  It is so easy to be with her.  The song ended and Sean asked Shore if he wanted to change partners.  There was nothing that Alan wanted more on this Earth than to hold Tara in his arms for 4 minutes.  There was nothing he feared more.  Sally went to dance with Clay, and Tara slipped into Alan's arms.  He found himself looking into the dark pools of her eyes.  'Did I do alright?  With the dress, I mean.  I know you were worried.' ' You look truly beautiful.' Alan said.  Tara was touched by his honest answer.  She had expected some flip comment.  She had wanted a reaction from him, but she was surprised at his quiet demeanor.  She looked into his face, and where she expected closed sarcasm, she found open heart.  For those few minutes, as the band played, Alan Shore and Tara Wilson lost themselves in each other's eyes.  Tara felt his pain, his longing and his loneliness.  Alan felt her desire to be close to him, really close, and he allowed himself to feel everything for her in that few minutes.  When the song ended, Alan released her, somehow knowing it was forever.  Maybe.     The next few weeks went by quickly for Tara, who felt very alive.  She had dinner with Sean three times, lunch twice and an ice cream cone in the park on Saturday.  Allan threw himself into Sally, almost literally.  He had wined and dined her, yet not consummating the relationship.  Sally was not a rocket scientist, but she was a very bright woman.  She knew that if she was going to be able to seduce the difficult Shore, she would have to make the first move.  Something would have to be done.  Tonight.  Friday nights were always a welcome relief to the hectic week that had preceeded it.  At 6:30 PM, Tara had left with Sean for dinner.  Alan was finishing up some notes in the empty offices when his computer beeped, signaling an email for him.  He wearily clicked the mouseimmediately, it was from Sally.  She had left about two hours earlier without a word.    When he opened the email, there was a rather fetching picture of her in a very small bikini.  His interest immediatly perked up, and he reluctantly scrolled down the screen to the writing:  Alan, Let me take you on an adventure.  Are you game?  Grinning, he clicked on the reply button and typed:  Sally, I am always game.  What did you have in mind?  Hitting send, Alan waited.  He absently stack files and papers, until he heard another beep.  Opening the mail, he saw a photo of Sally, in a very sexy teddy, draped over a Victoian bed.  There was nothing written below.  Alan again hit reply, and typed:  I see.  What would you like for me to do?  A few minutes later, another beep signaled her response:  Since we both have to work, I decided to arrange a tropical getaway closer to home.  Be at my house in 30 minutes.  Pack lightly and bring your suit.  Alan responded:  Which suit?  The responding email brought Alan a photograph of the lucious Sally, nude, with strategically placed leis and orchids on her.  Alan smiled at the site of her cute butt in the air.  Only one word was written:  Birthday.  Alan grabbed his briefcase and headed out the door, not even bothering to shut down the computer.  Exactly what I needed, Shore thought.  Sally greeted Alan at the door wrapped in a thin sarong, with a yellow flower in her lush locks.  Handing him a very cold and very strong drink topped with fruit and a paper umbrella, she took his overnight bag and coat to the closet in the hall.  When she led Alan into the living room, he saw that there were plants and palms and even mini Tiki torches.  All of the furniture was covered with silky tropical fabrics.  She certainly pays attention to details, thought Alan, smiling broadly.  He was touched by her efforts.  Sally looked at his clothes and shook her head.  'No.  You are way overdressed for this.' 'What would you suggest?' Alan asked.  'And do not even THINK about a grass skirt.  I chafe easily.' 'How about this?'  Sally held up a long expanse of dark Hawaiian print cloth. 'You CANNOT be serious.'  Alan shook his head firmly, 'I am NOT wearing some kind of mahi mahi skirt thing.  You have had too many of these.'  Alan drank his very strong rum punch.   'Fine.  Party pooper.'  Sally pouted prettily.  ' I have a nice robe for you.  Now, first a soak in the Jacuzzi, then dinner.' 'Jacuzzi?'  Alan looked around quizzically. 'Come with me.'  Sally commanded.    Alan followed obediantly, more than a bit curious.  Leading him through her bedroom, she walked into the bath, where a large whirlpool tub sat filled with steaming, fragrant water and flower petals.  A lone rubber ducky, deorated with a flower attached to his tail.  Shore had to smile at the childish touch.  Sally flipped a switch and soothing island music mixed with waterfall sounds filled the darkened room.  There were flowers and palms and candles all over, giving the illusion of a hidden grotto.  Sally turned a knob and the water in the tub swirled, causing the duck to spin crazily.  I know just how he feels, thought Alan.  He turned to see Sally hanging a thick, black terry cloth robe on a hook on the back of the door.    'Now you get comfortable in the bath.  I will go and check on dinner.'  Sally ordered firmly. 'So, what are we having?  Poi?' 'No, we are having jumbo shrimp kabobs with tropical fruit and salad.' 'Sounds great.  I am famished.'  Sally left, closing the door behind her, leaving Alan to undress.  When he eased himself into the swirling water, he leaned back and closed his eyes.  He finished his powerful drink as his muscles relaxed in the bubbling water.  The drink was beginning to hit him, he realized, as he contemplated the kalaidascope created by the spinning flower petals and the bobbing duck.  He was very relaxed.  A soft knock at the door interrupted his drunken reverie.  He noticed Sally replacing his drink with a fresh one.  She said something to him, and he shook his head and pointed to his ear that he could not hear her above the whirlpool and music.  She moved closer to him, repeating that dinner was almost ready.  Alan just beckoned to her, come closer.  She leaned over the tub, near his face, and he smiled up at her as his hand reached out and grabbed her wrist.  He swiftly pulled her into the tub with him, causing a surfing duck to tumble to the floor, along with a considerable water.  Alan rolled Sally beneath him, pinning the struggling girl underneath him.  As he laid on top of her body, he deftly untied her sarong, pulling it off her body and throwing it to cover the watching duck.    'I thought you were famished.' Sally whispered huskily, as Shore stared into her eyes.  She could feel him on top of her, and his growing physical reaction to her wet bare softness.  'I'm starving.' Alan said seriously.  His mouth came down to hers, and he kissed her fiercely.  She slipped under the water, his mouth on hers, his tongue exploring and commanding her mouth, his hand on her breast.  They both came up from the water, and he was feeling much less like an old man as his leg moved to brace her in the water.  His head moved down to her lush, wet breasts as her breathing became labored.  I'll show you old man, Alan thought, as his hands moved down her body.   A few hours later, Alan Shore sat on the cloth draped sofa, in the black robe.  Sally was sitting on the floor, at his feet, leaning her head against his knee.  As they both ate ravenously, he contemplated her dark head.  What a sweet girl.  She was an eager and open lover.  He was delighted by her enthusiasm and passion when he made love to her in the tub and again in the bed.  No complications, no deep discussions, no need to be defensive.  Alan bit into a piece of sweet mango.  I feel better already.  Sally rose, taking his empty plate and hers into the kitchen.  He leaned back, reclining on the sofa cushions.  He felt himself dozing off.  When he awoke, a soft blanket was over him, and silky pillow under his head.  He rose, and after finding the bathroom again, he came out into Sally's room.  She was curled up under a sheet, nude, her cheek on the pillow.  Alan sat on the bed, next to her.  He watched her even breathing and the dark shadows of her lashes on her cheeks.  He pulled the blanket up to tuck around her.  He rose and took off the robe, easing into the bed behind her, curling his body around her warm curves.  Her hair tickled his nose on the pillows.  She stirred and moved slightly, as Shore eased his arms around her and whispered in her ear.  'Shhhhhhh.'   They both drifted back to sleep, wrapped around each other.

"       A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles.  part 1 - I got a right.  Nothing i've ever heard matches the stupidity of iggy. His moronicism is legendary... from running around with guys in nazi suits... to fucking 12 year olds in the butt. Nothing compares. That doesn't change the fact that his music is of the highest caliber of schlock rock the world has ever known... i might not find myself thinking of iggy in a moment of high reverie after completing a world shaking endeavor that soothes the lives of millions....  but then again... i might... and when i did... i could do far worse then thinking 'i got a right' is the finest piece of unreleased music that ever walked the planet.  It's like the five versions on 'i got a right' (bomp bcd139) are so mind numbingly insanely beautiful pieces of the musical edge of the seventies that couldn't be encompassed by bread or neil young. Bet they cut and snorted lines of coke, meth, and dogshit off of the vinyl i just mentioned. It'd explain the booze and adrenalin' fueled music on 'i got a right'. They were up to their ass to their dealers and had ta had ta had ta do it or their fingers would be cut off up to their wrists. Ugly music... but i love rolling down the road to it... i love blasting it from my cheesy pc speakers... it's about the most gritty music that i've ever heard... only siouxsie sioux is more pained. Now. let me explain my rationale here. I'm going to listen to the entire iguana chronicles over the next couple days and type whatever the fuck comes to mind... from legends to imaginations to whatever fucking dogshit i feel like poopin' out of my fingers. Right now? i'm thinking that only iggy could manage to sound affected when letting out a screech... but that's ok... it's take 3 and he's probably going... damn... the bookies will be after us next. I can't tell you why i don't quite respect iggy. I love his music... i love his voice... i love the sound that he puts together... but somehow... it's like iggy doesn't quite come up to the level of humanity that fuckers like nils lofgren do in their schlock audacity. 'lost a number'? a piece of complete garbage that nobody should love... but it has me tappin my feet.. my fingers... and wishing i had 'grin's 1+2=3' or whutever the fuck that album was. I've got iggy though... and i love his face when he realizes i was just fucking with him psychically by saying i thought nil's (slippery fingers) lofgren had more honesty then him.... it's on the cover of the 'i got a right' cd. He looks like a 10th grade girl when she gets to the marilyn spears concert and finds that the tickets are scalped and she's going to suck a dick to get into the concert. Kinda pissed off... but more put out. Did i say put out? i know you did. Now... to explain myself. I'm not buying one thing about iggy... the fact that he's a rock and roller.... he's like a lounge crooner... always has been... but he found he couldn't make money as a lounge crooner... the days of dean martin and buddy love are long gone... only rock sells... and not even slow rock... his entire genre is maxed out with doofs like bread, grin, the carpenters, and tony orlando and dawn... so what's left to do.... but rock. and buttrock it is... nobody has ever left america wondering what the fuck more then iggy... a fairly good selling pair of albums with a critically acclaimed 3rd album and iggy disappears... loaded... drunk.... all fucked up... but then what the fuck... the stones could do it.... only iggy couldn't... that's because he's a poseur... what pose he's making? rock and roll. He'd rather do some simple arrogant changes and lay back and tell a story about the truck that ran into his gramma then have to perform a stage show.... he doesn't want to climb on shit like mick... he wants to sit back... relax.... and croon.... and he does... but the kids get bored... so he jumps up and shows them his buttcrack... then goes out and struts like pre-elvis mania. Jimmie Rodgers he ain't though... his honeycomb is 12 years old so he's gotta jump around like david fuckin' bowie.... not that he doesn't love rock and roll... it's been very very good to him... just like hip-hop was to j. lo... even though she was more into streisand then lisa lisa and the cult jam. Now... iggy is gettin' kinda pissed... he's done boocoo takes of this shit and the lounge vocalists haven't come in yet... no sha-la-lahs... no beebopdoodoolie-doos and still a long ass road before he gets to the sweet strains that he always meant to capture in kill city. yes... maybe lounge isn't the right word to describe where he's aiming... more like dion... was dion lounge? dunno... but the fucker ended up doing plenty of holiday inns and singing versions of bing crosby toons. Now.... why do you think that iggy finally decided to respect bowie.... my guess? that gig bowie did on crosby's (sinatra's?) wait... andy williams... christmas special. Iggy finally saw that bowie wasn't just a space cowboy.. running around on drugs fucking all the chicks in london that keith richards hadn't pissed on. He saw that bowie was a light of wisdom to the lounge scene... and he had to recognize that nobody would ever do more to push him into the lounge limelight then bowie.... you see.. bowie used to blow the guy at the holiday inn. Iggy just would ask him for a cigarrette and make kissy faces at him. Nobody has ever claimed iggy wasn't a stud though... he was.... he was balling anything that gave him drugs.... some rich lil' bich comes up and gives him fitty bucks from her purse (not that she KNEW she was giving it to him) and all of a sudden iggy's beggin fer some skin.... what kinda skin? a fitty spot... cuz he owes his drug dealer... and he hates the fact that he's got a major label contract and doesn't have a fucking nickel to rub on his dick (DAMN YOU SCOTT ASHETON) and he's living in a hotel room for the 50th day running... he didn't realize that even as a multi-millionaire when you're spending more then 200 bucks a day... it goes mighty fast... not that he had that kinda money... he was in gravy... but didn't have led zepp's kinda money... just led zepps kinda spendthrift groupies.... were you one? many were.... nothing ever stopped him though... on the street... passing his bottle to a hobo... buying another... finding a new friend... finding a new dog to get drunk with... cruising up to the hotel... making them want to kick him out... then flashing a grand at them.... was it like that? i don't care... it paints a pretty picture... so does this.... neil armstrong.... the man on the moon... and iggy sitting there in his first apartment wishing he could buy a ticket so he could rock and roll on the moon.... was that enough? is that all he could do? spend money? nope... he was drunkass motherfuckin' philospher.... philosophizing about whether or not his drugs would run out. they did.  end rant 1. tomorrow? rant 2 I'm sick of you.  A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles.  part 2. I'm sick of you.  slow groove... iggy sounding like a fucked up brian jones with bad breath. and so.. the night continues... williamson sucking on guitar... right from the first... i'm like... damn... isn't loud enough.... not that it isn't tasty.... but it's another piece of iggy's throwaways.... it's a good one though.... 'sick of you' and a buncha cheesy organ riffs... except they couldn't afford the fucking organ.... damn... shoulda stuck with elektra.... and so... another groove ripping through the night... sounds good on the heroin they scored though.... and so... groovin... slowly... kinda angry... kinda wanting to be my dog.... but they aren't... and they aren't and they aren't.... not that williamson really sucks on guitar.. it's just kinda 60s derivative instead of the forward looking jive grooves that the elektra albums promised.... no wonder this song got dumped.... awww.. it's alright.... but it's not awright. and so the groove picks up a bit... iggy tries to keep it from going in the dumpster... but somehow.. he knows that it won't...  will he get any money from williamson from it? dunno... but something tells me williamson is a villianous little fuck.... did he give iggy money for these masters? how bout the ashetons? dunno... care.. have to speculate though... maybe mike watt will find out for me... suupersnoof... checking like poirot to find the ancient crimes of these bozos.... and the groove rocks on... he's sick of me.. he's sick of you... he's got all these hangers on.. and the only thing that keeps him going is the studio and the drugs... he doesn't want to go anywhere near the crowds again... or does he.... luded up.. talking trash.. wishing to god he hadn't taken 5 of them... but jumpin' around just the same.... does iggy have anything but id that drives him? does he have a superego? dunno.... care... but dunno... how are his drugs today. I'd say they aren't bad... but he could use some food... more hambergers... more hambergers... get me a goddamn hamberger. and then.... something breaks.... he realizes it's not about the music... the drugs... the hamburgers... the groupies... about his making bowie his bitch. and he knows how to do it. He sees a vision in his mind of bowie kissing his ass going 'great stuff igster' great stuff.. slobber slobber. So he tightens shit up a little... starts dropping some rockin' riffs that only a brit could love into it he starts playing these back and forth call and response vocals where he's the only vocalist... he knows bowie is a whore for playing the kinks in one headphone and the who in the other.... and the groove begins to pick up... i'm thinking that maybe the drugs got to him.... but they didn't... the guitars got to him... he realized they lethal instruments in more ways then one... and that the cia wasn't chasing him... it was the fbi... and that jim morrison wasn't really dead... he was bruce lee... and that your mom was really a beast of mordor... and not a beast of harad as he'd always thought.... and then... he crakced... his brain spilling out on the pavement in the studio... that they used to hose down after the animals pissed all over it.... and the music kept playing... and playing... and he couldn't leave.. he couldn't take a whizz... he had to piss on the drums... and he did... and he got shit all over asheton's face... and he got the shit beat out of him.... only he was faster.. and it's off to the looney toon races again.... and so what... the music... who cares... it's about the scream.. and vile noises that are coming out of his butt and the pants that are showing his buttcrack... and the drugs that are finally taking hold... oh... wait.... that's the ulcer from the booze last night.... i'm finally sick enough that i'm getting hallucinations.... i don't need the drugs anymore.... wooooo woooooooo woooooooo! woooooo! and the dog howling and barking on the back of the soundtrack.... and then.... oh no.... off to the can.... the hottie i was checkin' out..... has left.... and all the shit... and all the shit... and finally... he puts his mind back on the prize... bowie as his bitch.... shake appeal.... the grooves... shlurping the microphone.... just like he wants bowie to... and so many groupies... and all of them smearing make-up all over their face like the 'swamp women' and all the money that i spend on the crackheaded bimbos that are in the ward right now.... oh... wait... that was the eighties... and i'm not there yet.... but they are... and they're thinking back hells at me... and all i can do is spew butt juice all over the bass... and rant on... rant on... all i've ever seen is the money... and all i've ever seen is the donutwhores... and all i've ever seen is the drool running down the mic and bowie going... ooooh... i wuv this album matey and passing it back and forth to his homey friends and their love pigeons.... bowie... love pigeons.... iggy.. his dog... i can't see nothing comin' i can't see the beer spilling in my eyes... i can't see the drugs stopping me from ranting more... and then i realize... it ain't the drugs... it's the religion... i'm caught up in the furor of my love for the world.... only it's in words... and music... and iggy pretending to be timothy leary and jim morrison rolled up into one stomping dervish of a moaning man.'winners and losers' and something has to let me know who is who... what is what... i don't care.. i don't want you to know that it's the eighties now and they've got a gay midi box... and they don't have the sense that those retarded kids with guitars blazing had... but then... iggy would crrrry..... and go back to kate pierson.... and then... the grooves pick up again... and the midibox starts playing some flock of seagulls crap.... and all the stinging guitars in the world can't get them out of my head.....  now..... if i told you the ending to this story... you'd be unhappy... but basically... i'm saying that iggy burned everyone... including me.... he knew i was getting the hell off on his seventies groove... so he psychicallly planted a cheezy 80s riff on this great triple ep crapathing that i'm listening to bomp(bcd113).... and all i can hear.. is the cheezy organthinger with arena rock beats... but iggy hasn't made an arena appearance lately.. he's stuck following the beats of nina hagen sniffing up her trail/tail (take your pick) and there's one thing that he's hunting right now.... the music... but he knows it isn't all the music... it isn't all the drugs... it isn't all the insert stardom catchicon here.... it's that he's hunting bowie.... for taking his anal verginity... and soon... he'll kick him in the glass spider.. and it'll be on like donkey kong.... you see... he made bowie his bitch... but one night... late... while bowie was in his cups and ig was sleeping off the whores... bowie and mick jagger snuck into his room and forcibly made him eat dick and take it in the ass... you see... they had his buttsnuggly pajamas and they were going to set them on fire.... and he couldn't have that... he couldn't... he couldn't..... and for three days they buttsodomized him and made his drugs taste bad.... and he had to get back to his ancient grooves again... so now... he hunts.... and searches.... and tries to find that little weasel bowie in one of his haunts so that he can kill him dead dead dead and have it blamed on his sissyboy.  that's the ending... but we aren't there yet.... right now... igg's still hunting some bastard in 1993... remembering his old lyrics from the drug days.... he's found his groove again... he's not using some faggot duran duran arrangement and he's kicking mad ass as a musician..  an entertainer... and the only thing missing.... is the thrill of seeing bowie the next day after he smeared poop on his jowls and flushed his speed down the toilet.... boy was bowie pissed... it led to the breakup.... no... not of the rolling stones... of bowie and iggy... starstruck lovers... stupid binge and purge junkies trying to see who could remain thinnest and have more skinflaps.... it was ig... and bowie was all broke up about it too... he had to hide his face in tina turner's ass and gobble... for like three years.... soul music... more like a lovesong to tina.... but wait... this isn't about bowie... or is it... it's about ig... and his groupies... and his stageshow... and his duckwalk... and his fat anal love troll.. the one he stole from lou reed.  and now.... there's nothing like an old sound.... and they're back in the 80s.... grinding and grinding shake appeal... knowing that bowie is beaten and done for... he's laying back in some chinese brothel and iggy has taken all his fans and iggy has taken all his drugs... and all that matters anymore is the recording... cuz he knows someday he'll be dead and his book petered out after the first 1100 pages.... and then nothing could go wrong.. until the dog ate it... and the braindrool started and the crafty bastards had taken his dreams... and here he was whoring himself on stage again... except he didn't have a contract and he didn't have a deal... and he didn't have a groupie... except for that girl out in the audience who was wearing a siouxsie sioux t-shirt and looked like she might shoot him... and the tight pants on her put her his old song into his head.... it's the choppiness of cd's that i hate.... it's skipping on me... like iggy... he's skipping around like a little girl on stage and i don't care nuffin at all. except i remember the beer i spilled on it last summer.. when i was ready to kill creem for being a white power joint... and suzy for taking it out on me emotionally even though i was living according to my belief system (to not be a whore for a white power bunch of asstwats. themselves whores for israel.. riled up any time israel needs distraction from their crime sprees) and all i've managed to do is dig deeper into the iggy paradigm... was it them holding hands and walking in the park? nope.. it was them hiding each other's drugs pissing on each other and pretending to be mick jagger (the male) one at a time.... and then... something happened... they realized that mick sucked...(thus the lips) and that they had to do something about it... they did... they hooked keef on heroin and started running him around town.... calling out the names of ancient vagabonds to him who used to sell him junk.... nothing was new... one long sentence... one evil grin.... one hated rant (i hate this rant) so the fuck what it's real... so am i... and i'm coming to town... when i get there? self-aggrandizement city.... you'll think corey haim was goddamn pat morita for all my self-aggrandizement..... and here comes a vintage 1980s drool... jeez.. why didn't bomp put this crap on a 80s droolfest release instead of the classic 1972 studio outtakes.... BECAUSE THEY KNEW NOBODY WOULD BUY IT! Is this whole thing worth the 6.fitty or whutever? probably... this is a classic documentation of whatever the fuck iggy was drooling before raw power.... and some of the stuff he drooled in the eighties. Not that i mind iggy's drooling... it beats the fuck outta listenin to joe walsh.... it beats the fuck outta listening to most of the bastard 70s rockers.... the only thing that it doesn't beat? is listening to iggy in his perfect form... ranting... screaming... on stage.... but.... we'll get to that.  end rant 2. part 3? a big ole fuck you called.... rough power.  A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles.  part 3. Rough Power  Crack... drag... beer opens in the background... bowie hears it and his face screws up like michael jackson listening to a whispers record.... they shouldn't do that... he thinks... and his healthy bat ears root out all the pain of iggy's existence... he wants to whitewash it... unbeknownst to him... he's become iggy's bitch. The record company thinks bowie is an auteur.... a madonna like figure of the seventies... there to make iggy's rancid smoove enough for a mitch miller listening audience of record execs. I don't buy it however.... iggy cut this great set of demos... bowie cleaned them up.... bowie had something else in mind... you see... bowie wanted iggy in europe.... and europe was listening to kraftwerk... not stealer's wheel and all the grungy 70s rock that was playing in 1972.... so.. he needed a crystal clear audio document to get the iguana to a rockier beach... europe... where the gays play... where the guys like bowie run around kissing buttocks all day and making money for it.... gimme danger? gimme dogshit... cuz that's all this album was once bowie got through with it.... crystally washed dogshit using a european smoothing process that makes it go down smooth for international retards. Iggy meanwhile... is putting out the feelers... feeling warm and fuzzy for bowie... wanting to talk to him about kraftwerk and ducks deluxe... when deep down in his soul... he's nurturing a need to play slade records at bowie til' bowie pukes. you see... iggy is sending out a i'm soft and fuzzy in clean eurocrapspeak to bowie.... bowie buys it... and when the cbs record whores come to town to ask him about this new kid iggy... bowie says... lemme play with it.... and he does... he jacks off all over it... keeping the raw vocal track.... dropping the rest a bit... but mainly lowering his sex rival james williamson's (iggy's other bitch) guitar down to a healthy little growl... instead of the raw fire it has become after realizing that the 60's sucked. Now... in iggy's band... nobody has provenance... there is no badass boss bitch.... not in bowie's band... you see bowie was a big ole fag (this comes as no surprise to you) and had to have everything his way... my way.. or the highway (a phrase he picked up from mitch 'hendrix's dick carrier' mitchell or something...) so the raw balanced simple noise that was designed to bust from the am radio that ig' grew up on... became a big quadraphonic pink floyd-y tour deforce that wouldn't upset bowie's hangerons and the record execs... who were looking at each other going... hey... can we get laura nyro to record another album? Now. Nothing up my sleeve.. presto! i'm going to change the subject. This whole set of reviews isn't about Raw Power... it's about the love affair of bowie and iggy.... two starstruck lovers who were broken up by mick jagger.   Once upon a time... there was widdle boy named david bowie... and he had a lot of money and respect... but he didn't have one thing.... internal honesty... he was playing the music industry for whatever sound they wanted to hear that week.... what they wanted to hear at the time bowie was listening to iggy's demos... was another 'ziggy stardust'... only he couldn't find the riffs in his head... he couldn't find the songs to sing... he had the same old mumbledy-junk... but not quite the moped he was looking for. Iggy came along... just then.... and he knew he had a daddy.... money didn't impress bowie.... music did... and iggy had the music soaking out his pores.... bowie put away his aretha franklin and tina turner records... and started poring over iggy's catalog. He heard 'the stooges' and thought... what a piece of work... wish i'd done it... then he picked up 'funhouse' and said to himself... i've found ziggy. He dropped iggy into the entire psychic framework he had made unbeknownst to himself.... bowie had found his daddy. Now... bowie had listened to those albums once or twice along the way... but he was trying to get albums by the beatles (those gorgeous blokes) into his head... and didn't really have time for the madman from detroit. Iggy... meanwhile.... was drunker then a skunk... going... goddamn i don't know how the fuck i can get the record guys to buy this shit.... they'll ask me to tone it down.... they'll ask me to sling it on 'andy williams'... they'll ask me to do my tennessee ernie ford act for them.... and i doanfugginwanna.... so... i'm going to go burn down cbs records.... and he got a gallon of gasoline.... a gram of methamphetamine... and went to their l.a. whorehouse..... when he got there.... some zootsuited crazy in dayglo colors who didn't realize carnaby was dead said... oooh... igster.... we've got a producer for you.... and iggy stopped... and went... who... joni mitchell? bob krause? mick fleetwood? i don't care.. just get my record out there.... and they said.... it's bowie.... and ig went.... bowie sucks.... and a healthy glint came into his eye... and he said... i'll make him my bitch.   of course the record industry geek figured that this was some rockstar slang for producer and didn't realize that iggy had just turned the corner into the most storied romance of his career... not that it started as a romance for ig... just a domination of another groupie... he knew that bowie was hooked and looking for the raw primal street sound that he could only find by listening to stones records and going to 'sweet' shows... iggy went back to his motel room... and called james on the phone... and said... hey... bring me some pizza.... and james knew that the love had gone out of their relationship.... iggy twinkled.... and some fucking anchovies... i'm going to lick them off your back... and williamson smiled because he knew that iggy wasn't going to just dump him.  Now... at this point in time... you're going 'it wasn't anything like that.... it was a formal antiseptic corridor where mitch miller told iggy.... ok... we like your record... but we're going to have to have a producer on it... we're going to ask around....   that doesn't suit iggy's mad power persona though... can you see the igster nodding happily and going... sounds great... let's get right on it... buttkiss buttkiss? neither can i. I can see iggy going FUCK YOU MITCH MILLER! I CAN'T READ... MUCH LESS FOLLOW THE GODDAMN BOUNCING BALL IN FRONT OF YOUR CROWD OF RAINCOATED URBAN SLIME. only he'd say it... like... 'RARRRGH MITCH... YOU kNOW I Don'T lIKe BoB EZrin'... mitch stank at him gleefully from behind his hai karate... and iggy went.... i need a beer.  now.... at this point in time... i've listened to the entire set of raw demos.... you haven't... you should buy them.... they aren't my favorite of the iguana collection... but they still are pretty good... they were kind of a letdown though... i expected different rhythms.... more cussing... something.... instead of bowie twiddling switches and tossing filters on them. that's all he fucking did... added his name.... twiddled some switches... and history was made.   iggy smiled.... and once the record was cut... sed... we should go on tour.... and they did.... that's what's coming up...   at the moment though..... the fags at wabx are saying that iggy doesn't sound like mott the hoople.... NO SHIT! iggy created mott the hoople.... they were just some ex-hippie band until they heard 'the stooges'... and then decided to toss a dylanesque spin on it.  what? you want poetry? you want pavoratti? i'm listening to an album that represents a personal amount of pain to me... i spent several dozen hours trying to whip creem into a publishable conceptual thing... then realized that it was a whitepower joint.... putting non-whites into subsidiary roles... dropping any reference to non-whitepower-based rockers... and tossing in some salt by referring to fleetwood mac or whutever crap they used to listen to between slade albums in the 70s... was it always whitepower? nope... but whitepower fags are attracted to names like 'creem' or anything white... and the guy that ran it kicked the bucket... and all of a sudden.... they're doing whiter then white bands like 'talking heads' and 'that fag band that i can't remember' and any other non-rock (too many jews in rock) that they can get their hands on... people that got beat up by the anti-nazi contingents in punk rock. FUCK JONATHAN RICHMAN.  Now... while creem was busy ignoring anything that had any non-white performers put into the forefront of music... I was working my ass off fighting a battle for the underdog... the palestinian peoples.... meanwhile... every couple weeks or so... i'd get into a rock and roll writing jag... trying to turn the poop that creem under Bitch Matheu had become into the old rag that made music critics cry... but it wasn't to happen.... Matheu had his stable of retards and wanted me to try and play lester bangs... erudite maniac... only i wasn't playing that... i had too many chops in 'black' music.... you can almost see 'black' music on the few reviews that Bitch Matheu tossed into the mix so he wouldn't have to hear it about racism... just like you could almost see 'black' musician on some of the musicians that are buried in the background on his website. NO FREE PLUGS BITCH!   So I balked... wrote public enemy and a number of music professionals (in journalism and other) and said... watch out for creem... they're white power. Guess what happened next.... Someone loosely affiliated with the chuck d/p.dudey megamix released a classic rock toon... 'hey ya' on the speakerboxx album... almost daring Bitch Matheu to review it. They didn't.. until it won a messa grammies... then grudgingly... they put it on their website... until they could bury it again.... one of the tastiest rock/hybrid albums of the decade... and they treat it like a sidenote.... while they hype 'burning monkeys' or some other whitepower garbage.  Suzy at BOMP takes off on me when i tell her that I just said FUCK CREEM.... the whores at creem 'brian bowe' pretend they never heard of me... even though i was writing back and forth with them and had just been given a whole webpick section on their private group links board. I don't blame her for being p.o.'d... she'd just sent me 10 albums in the iguana collection.... for me to review for creem.... something that sounded hunky dory to Bitch Matheu when i wrote him about it.... I wrote him a bunch... figured they needed a little conditioning... you see... not only am i an NSA agent... I'm also CIA... FBI... DEA... and any goddamn other government agency you could imagine.... I WHUPPED THE NAZIS ASS... we sold radioactive materials to hitler's fagboys and then strapped some geiger counters into the radio systems of the british and american planes.... so we had a clear stereo 'static' warning in the gunner and pilots headsets  whenever nazi steel was around. This psychic endeavor (as well as hipping churchill to the nazis as early as 1928) won me mad respect in international intelligence communities.... but they had to wait for me to be born.... I was born in 1970... out of my mind... but it wasn't a saturday night.... it was a hell night.... adopted by some crazy bitch because my birthmother was being oppressed psychically and financially.... and here i am.... listening to raw power... and going.... NSA, DEA, CIA, FBI, as well as brass positions in ALL FOUR MILITARY BRANCHES OF THE U.S. ARMY. My whim becomes law.... the patriot act was made to protect me from israeli spies... and Ms. Suzy Bomp (who i respect tremendously cuz she wrote back to a punk rocker who just wanted to tell her how much he dug the gravedigger v) is barking up my ass cuz i have promo that i can't put into a magazine format because whitepower isn't my bag.   Well Ms. Suzy? i understand.... i've had my work go free to a number of buttmunches over the years... I hope that this series of diatribes makes you feel better. I love you... and would lick your ass if you weren't so damn old!  The rock show from wabx is still playing in the background.... it's retarded fm chatter... drivetime or morning jocks... it doesn't matter... the music is great... buy this album.... it's even got a tinny recording of 'not right' (is this licensed? fuck if i know... It would explain some karma if it wasn't)... just to save suzy's ass if it isn't licensed... the static on it could qualify it as 'pop art' or collage-modification of art for copyright purposes.  Now.... you wanted a review... you got one... and i'm not talking to bomp... i'm talking to ig. I know you read this.... I know you heard it at a psychic level... I know you're itching to avoid my show and say 'it sucks'. Well... i've got some news for you!  Bowie was your bitch and still is... He cries himself to sleep every night thinking of how he ruined his relationship with iggy because of the art.... you see... bowie wanted to go to the museum... iggy wanted to find some drugs and get a party going on... bowie had been doing that for years and was sick of it... i know.. you're thinking... bowie? jaded? really? how unexpected.... Only you're saying it like this... I'm glad he's fucking done with this review.  end rant 3. part 4? a shitty album called 'open up and bleed'  A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles.  part 4 - Open Up and Bleed!  I wouldn't buy this album. Now let me tell you why it's an indispensible part of your record collection. Iggy was gettin' sick of rockin. I know... Iggy? not rock.... well... I guarantee you he was fucking sicking of it... BLeeeYaahaaa... all night... every night... to dozens of adoring fans.... to loud blazing guitars..... but now he had something he needed.... a fool to play organ for him, and a cheezy fartfisa it was.... electric piano from hammond or some awful crap.... but who cares.... it' made him what he always wanted to be..... a lounge singer.   For what is a lounge singer... without a cheezy pianner. He finally was halfway there....   Iggy was born James Osterberg... stuck in detroit.... admittedly a musical hub thanks to folks like Berry Gordy. Mow-town! he used to call it.... doin' the neighbor's lawns so he had an extra hunnerd pennies to buy a joint with. And there it was... him out there... mowing the lawn of some freak who was working at a power plant or something.... a doob tonight.... he's thinking.... vrooom.... vrooom...... the lawnmower of iggy's music is undeniable.... running through leaves.... seeing them fly all the fuck up all over the place... smoke choking him from the diesel engine that the neighbor bought at sears.... and him.... sweating... wanting to get back home to smote out and sing along with a dean martin album....   i been pushed... i been shoved too long... even tried to buy my song.... bleeaaaaarrrrrrghhhhhhh...... iggy has it made.... singing his first true lounge song.... a drunken lounge song ala tom waits only with a cheesier organ..... out of money again.... even though he's slaving on a tour and has just stopped in rehearsal studio in new york.... he's already made kissy-faces with bowie... but he knows that he needs some money to party with him in europe.... so he's cruising through the nation.... makin' a lil' cash here... a lil cash there... and considering a new album... cuz those always made him more money then shlepping around the u.s. getting wasted on tour. Open up and bleed.... the lounge lizard... mr. iguana himself.... the man is singing a great tune.... his background musicians (they stopped being his band around bowie... when he realized the cult of personality was stronger the then the cult of society) are playing along.... doin' some great riffs... but for the first time... it's iggy out there alone.... doin' his thing just like he always was... but not with his brothers.... alone.... strong.... and slower then usual..... still sounding like he'd swallowed asphalt..... but obviously thinking about his future as a lounge musician.......  he doesn't trust his bandmates not to give away his secret though.... he wants to be doin' como songs. tina tina tina marie.... Hip, I didn't know lips could kiss, ( Hip hip )  Hup I didn't know wives could flirt, ( Hup hup )  Hoop, I didn't know girls could be like 'Tina Marie'..... except he sings it like... Johannnna.... johaannnnna.... i wanna blow... wanna blow right back to you..... soft organ riffs ala 'the trip'... iggy moanin' low into the microphone... gettin ready to smooth his hair back ala buddy love.... check out my rings asheton.... check out my cigarrette.... i'm cool to drool..... it's ig... and he's still havin' to rock a little bit.... but he's almost there..... to where he's not a 100% motorpsycho nightmare... but someone to whom falling up the wagon could mean something .... cuz... isn't that what lounge singers do? fall off the wagon... into their cups... smackin' their woman around like perry como, dean martin, and of course... the inevitable... jerry lewis.......  gotta cover... gotta cover..... more rock... gotta cock in my pocket... gotta cruisa-a down that old highway... or whutever the lyric is.... it never really matters with ig... sexual suggestion.... leeer...... bleaaarrghhh.... it's just another song... it's just another tune... and another martooni at the end of the line..... this one's a rocker though.... so he's gotta open his shirt up a little bit.....  tug again at the cigarrette... and let the smoke drift up while he headbangs.....  nobody has ever spotted ig's lounge tendencies... he wears the rock and roll suit like it was tailor made for him.... and it probably was... tailor made by the finest groupies hollywood has ever seen.... make-up done for him right down to the beauty mark.... a junkies manicure.... and waiting for him when he gets home... a robe and ascot.... only it's more like more bruises and vomit.  now.... why would a guy do that to himself... bet iggy hears that all the time at this point... he's not in comfortable l.a. where drag queens and hippies hang out seamlessly at the whisky.... he's in new york... detroit... pittsburgh... baltimore.... home of class struggle and urban renewal.... he's not very happy about having to flex his muscles and act like a detroit metal rockstar... and to retaliate... he's got a buttmoidal electric pianner instead of the hammond organ that most of his compatriots use to make the dancefloor rumble....   drunker then usual.... he's wishing the set were over so he could sit back and get oral sex from some empty-headed bimbette that he could fill with his member...   it's 1973... he's been on tour... he's been to all the seedy watering holes this side of devil's junction... and now... he's back in a studio... thinking new album... but he's not feeling good.... he's not strutting... he's drowning... drowning in rock and roll.... wanting to snap his fingers... do his changes.... 'i'm a street walkin' cheetah with a heart full of napalm  ' but instead.. he's gotta keep up with the band... they want him to rule the stage like jim morrison.... but instead... he wants to fade into the club.... become part of the background to a martini glass and a dame....  and finally... he figures it out.... that the blues is what rock and lounge music have in common.... one went into a vegas room... the other went into a garage... and he's been in both.... hangin' out.... lickin' his eyebrows.... groovin like it's tuesday on a summer moon.....  so he trots out an old janis joplin tune 'cry for me' and rules the room for a minute.... cuz that dame and the martooni ain't everything... came here to see a show... di'n't yah...   i listen to the music for a minute... letting my readers fade.. letting my thoughts of iggy fade... and realizing... that all my feelings about this record upon casual listening around the bong have faded away.... this could have been the greatest stooges of all time.... except it wasn't.... iggy didn't want to drive another album home and become the new mick jagger.... there already was a mick jagger... and he was in rehab with keef.... pukin' out 'it's only rock and roll but i like it' and iggy din't... he liked the blues... he liked dean martin.... he liked a martini.... and here was another window of opportunity to show it off for the world.... only his band members weren't having it... they're all straining to play l.a. blues again.... fading back to a setting for iggy is beyond them at the moment.... me me me and my guitar is rock and roll.... me me me and my band is lounge. And iggy was comfortable in both forms..... but hell if he didn't slide into lounge at any given moment... when the drums quieted down... and the guitarist got tired... you see.... they weren't used to being all tired all the time like the jazz musicians... when the adrenaline ran out they got tired.... and started to nod off.....  rich bitch. iggy has taken control of the band.... made it clear that they were his.... and now his ultimate love song.... the lovesong to bowie that he wanted to sing on 'raw power' the lovesong that never materialized on an album because it was so personal to him.... it was one of those songs that couldn't be put on vinyl because then he'd be asked to interpret it.... instead of letting it sing through him. Sometimes iggy just lays back and lets the band play as he cries... knowing that he's going to serenade bowie through the tapers in the audience... and that eventually... he'll lay his rich bitch... you see.... ig was the p. dudey and bowie was the j. lo of his generation ... they were a lovestruck couple who even when they weren't together were always whispered in the same breath.... it was luvvv ferever...    bass and pianner and lounge and all the things that made memphis great.... iggy's soul roots are showin' again... the time he snuck into a baptist congregation.... the time that he stayed up late looking into an after hours joint... the time that he took a hundred hits of acid and watched the nutty professor....   the music slows down... the blazing guitars fade away... and the pianner plays on.... and iggy blasts bowie and his money thing and his cryin' shame you don't have any talent there igster attitude... bowie hides behind his rock and roll persona... iggy lives it.... even though it isn't him.... the band keeps playing.... iggy isn't part of it anymore... even though they are all his friends...... and sometimes... he fades into the music with them.... he's moved beyond... he's been adulated.. he's been vilified and lauded by the press... and they've just been the band... or scott and ron and james on guitar bass and drums.... nobody's tried to get inside their head... nobody has tried to imagine what they do after hours... nobody has given a fuck whether they cut themselves with glass or climb out on the crowd or not.... just as long as they keep playing.   Had scott thrown down the sticks.... had ron smashed his guitar into a fan... had they done anything to keep iggy from singing.... it'd have made them infamous in the eyes of the fans.... instead.. they're the troopers.... performing til' their fingers bleed.... tired up to their eyesockets from the party that iggy threw next door... banging their shoes against the wall to shut him and the groupies the fuck up.. they weren't even about the drugs... they were about the next days gig.... the next song... and then walter cronkite to see the lists of the dead.  I had to take a break from my writing here... it calls to me like rock and roll called to iggy.... it's a part of me.... i'm recognized for my skill at it... but my nature? is a musician.... all forms.... from country to jazz to blues to reggae to trance to all that the music is.... i don't distinguish... scat in the punk song.... rock steady versions of elvis... music is mutable and formless... but in iggy's time... it wasn't.... you had to be a rocker.... or you had to be a ___________ or you played country music or you were something unwanted in music.... the eagles... the 13th floor elevators... the count five.... the stooges... and no jumpin' to the lounge side of the fence once you've made it as a rocker.... country was ok if you were folk like those dogfuckers the byrds... but to leap into lounge? unheard of.... so... everything so often.. iggy slips a oooooooh.... or a beebopadooliedoo into the tune.... every so often he struts around like a fascist lounge singer doin' his i me mine routine.... but then.... he pulls the covers back over his eyes... and starts doin' a mick thang.... i got nothin'.... nothin' to sing... nothin' to feel.... nothin' to do.... i got nothin.... cept fer this here pianner.... and the joy of stage and radio and performance that began in the music of bob wills comes to a screeching halt in iggy.... cuz iggy's about the limelight.... and wants to be adulated.... but nobody gets him... because he hasn't taken the time to discover who he is.... he will... he spends the 70s... 80s... and part of the nineties rediscovering his personality.... but... i'm getting a little ahead of myself there..... he's not pouring his self into the music... he is the music... cuz it's all he knows except for skool... and he din't do too well in skool.  more later. i'm going to cry for iggy... the evita of rock music... even though he's bowie's badass muthafuckin' daddy. This album doesn't suck... but it doesn't own... it has moment's of utter joy and abandon... it has moments of complete unadulterated goofiness.... it's a good album... it was a good surfboard... it's tough to find a surfboard you like...   if you're reading this... you probably know how tough it is to find a surfboard you like... guarantee you if this album got stolen... i'd replace it. new orleans soundin' like a drunkass hammered chorus of phil spector drag queens... only more and more evil then anything you've ever heard.  there are two more songs to listen to again... on this album that i couldn't catch the groove in for my entertaining some goddamn loadie that was smokin' all my dope.... i still don't quite catch the groove on it... but i wouldn't trade it for anything... and i'd kill anyone who took it.  the she creatures of the hollywood hills... and a big ass smile on my face... and the first coke i've drunk in a month... and my unemployed existance with some neat toys await me........   end rant 4. rant 5 California Bleeding comin' up next....    A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles.  part 5 - California Bleeding  nothing new.... and then... iggy talkin' like dean martin. and then.... the noise.... the drums.... the blare.... the guitars... the sounds of your soul tearing through the mainstream music that you always wish you had. Iggy wishes he had a band... and he did... iggy wishes he were a lounge singer... and he soon realizes he can't have everything.... but soon... he does... and he puts together a lounge band... that's what this story is about... three great albums... where the greatest rock and roll band in the world... becomes the suckiest lounge band in the world.   That's just  the way iggy wants it you see... he wants to have a sucky ass lounge band to throw him into sharp relief.... so that all the people who went... wow... that's some pretty rockin' music... but the singer sucks... can see just how fucking awesome the stoogenator is....   i'm typing a little slower this review... i've hammered my way through the last few... this one... i'm just typing as fast as i can talk.... now... i can talk pretty fast... but that's not how i'm typing this one... i'm typing it... about the speed that iggy talks at the beginning of this record.... i said record... i know... it's a cd... but it's more... it's a recorded document of iggy's soul going to become what he always wanted to be. Perry Como.  Can you see iggy with his own tv show? cruising out with a cigareete and a bourbon and seven waiting for him back in his dressing room? i can... that's why all the appearances on miami vice.... jeopardy.... and every goddamn third rate movie the eighties produced...   the full moon shines in my window... and i feel myself changing.... i'm a werewolf... have always been... found out two years ago.... and there's nothin' i can do to stop it.... my jaw elongating... my snout craning outwards... my claws lengthening... and the hair on my ass... well... let's not get into that.  All i can tell you is it started a long time ago.... I found out that i was the only child of a crashed spaceman.... a big ole goddamn werewolf from planet xeuxes.... chased by intergalactic vampires who had destroyed his civilization... but not before he collapsed their galaxy... yes.... a giant collapsed galaxy of vampires.... or iggy... well.. i've been talking a lot about iggy lately... so... i think i'll tell you about the hunters.... they bred... and i was passed from womb to womb by psychic transporteleportationism.... they tried to chase me throughout the world... but here i am.... my father died... he was destroyed in the crash... but not before his massive love pheremones called a woman from the 15th century after us.... yes... time travel woman... and she came cuz she smelled his love... and then.. he impregnated her... and sent her embryo through the greatest wombs of history... from ten billion years in the past... to two hundred thousand million years in the future... and all their blood runs through my veins.... from womb to womb to womb.... and my blood runs through their veins... the werewolf strain of mankind... from me... courtesy of dad.... yup... big ugly hairy thing... and eventually i was dropped in the womb of a velvets fan (just to get even with iggy for not being true to his werewolf soul.. the werewolf soul of rock and roll... instead of the vampire soul of lounge.) and when i popped out... i was promptly seized by the vampire nurses and put into the arms of a loving sociopathic mother... who cares about me so much she saves me from the hells she puts me in.  my current hell? i'm single... 34... and stuck at my mom's house after kicking israel's ass silly for 4 years. want proof of that? search the web and the newsgroups for doc martian... it's there.  now... igster... he's crooning.... his werewolf soul is being called to my changed form... my silent eyes looking to hunt... but knowing the game i seek is not around.... lovely women in the coachella valley... some of the loveliest... but i seek a woman on the moors... a bogwitch... yes... i'm after siouxsie sioux... and all her legions of fans.... i love them... they make me twitch... just like i make israel twitch.... only not cuz i have my axe buried in their head.... but because it makes them laff to see me smile when i fart.  Ig's singing his heart out... higher then fuck.... the heroin is just scored... all you gotta do.. is say you're playing at the whisky and the balloons come out of thin air... and you can choose your grade... tonight... iggy chose the scaggy shit... cuz he likes the edge it gave him... even with some perfectly clean china white... he's got some cutdown indian bitch heroin that has like red shit in it.  The harmonica wails... i don't care who's playing it... never did... they either can play it.. or they can't.... Scott Thurston can.... and he is... he's the newest member of the band... and the guys have had him running out for sandwiches... pizza... and drugs all fucking day... and he's got the blues about it... that's ok.... he hocked a bloody loogie in the shit iggy shot into his arm... and he's smiling at iggy over the harp.... through the harp... his eyes glowing... cuz he's about to change... i have... my mom cages me in my room on the full moon nights... there've been too many times i come home drunk with some hot girl scared fucking shitless of my evil grin and crying to her... make him go away... he smells like sweat.... and i do... i can bathe all day and the sweat still doesn't go away... the pain that stinks through my pores.. the howling through endless nights... the wandering everywhere but the forest.... the desert... the oceanside.... the city... and i know she's around... the bogwitch... my heart and soul... my woman.... my love.... my angel... and she's reading this right now? is it you? come on over... i'm in indio... you know where it is.... it's where all the bands in the world come to pay homage to me.... cuz i kicked israel's ass....   ok... enough about me....  ig's singing open up and bleed.... and it's sounding like a million bucks... cheezy electric piano.... trainwreck on the keyboards.... john cage kinda crapola... only better... cuz ig is playing the toon he always wanted to play... he's already jumped forward to johanna in his head.. . he's already singing the greatest fucking lounge song that ever was.... and i still fucking love it... my rock and roll soul is goin'... bad lounge... bad.. bad... but his is still rock'nrollin.... and i can't stop... my fingers hurt... my soul bleeds for iggy... cuz i know what's coming next... the glass... and he cuts himself.... and he pretends it doesn't even happen... probably can't even feel it with all the morphine/heroin crapdoodle floating in his veins....   johanna.... said the magic word... the ultimate of sweet songs... the name of an ancient aunt of mine whose funeral i missed cuz i wanted to get loaded... even though she was the sweetest old lady in the world.... and iggy's singing... her name... but it touches my core within... and i remember all the family members i left behind in my quest for a rock n' roll lifestyle... i remember the pain i went through while trying to get back home only to have my family (mainly moms) screaming in my face.... and iggy starts in....   johanna... johanna.... i've been a fool but i'm comin' back to you.....  never can tell what it means... he's talkin' about his father... and what he learned from him... and the band plays on....  now... ig... or as i like to call him... the howling duhbeast.... something i know he's truly not.... people who are intelligent are very good at playing dumb.... keeps the kids in school from copying our homework.... iggy is confident in his soul.... so am i... confident to tell you that this is not about iggy... this whole rant is about my search for the bogwitch... the crazy lady who ruled my life forever... the woman who meant everything to me... but didn't want to see me.... cuz she thought i was like the guy that stalked her.... i wouldn't get up off my fat ass for her... much less stalk her.... but she didn't see that... and so... my wind and love continue to dance... dance in the cool night air.... kim... i still love you... it will never stop.... even if you act like a bitch to me....  now.... let me tell you all something.... my love for kim... is echoed in bowie's love for iggy.... he'll never be able to consumate it... he'll never be able to fulfill it... but it still burns within him... in spite of his other loves... in spite of his other mates... in spite of everything.... maybe someday i'll find myself with a woman... at home... and loving every second of peaceful country club living... but something in me had me cruising through the night in a third rate rural farm town... singing my heart out to kim... wishing like hell she were with me... in the daffodils... on the mountain.... climbing up the side of a hill so that when she or her friends went climbing in hemet after hiking every trail in joshua tree or palm springs... she'd not have oleander slapping at her... is that how i saw it.... nope... that's how i see it now....  and bowie? he smoothed the way for iggy by putting him into a kinder musical form... not the knifefighting angeldust ridden world of rock'n'roll circa 1973... but the sweet and simple lounge scene... the scene at which bowie excelled.... bowie on stage? bowie serenading people on drugs.... iggy in beer... nope... iggy shooting up to the bowie album... nodding off to starman.... saying he was ziggy iggy to friends... saying he was iggyziggy to lovers... and david bowie knowing it was all going on... psychically hooked to his groove cuz he loved him more then anything even though he knew he was basically just a rock'n'roll kid who was doin' the lawns... in blue jeans... and waiting to get home and get stoned.... bowie made iggy his daddy.... the daddy he always wanted... the loungesuited martini swilling artless but humane when in his cups daddy that iggy was to bowie....  now.... about kim... cuz her husband (yes... she's probably married with 2.4 kids and a kia) is all stressing at a psychic level.... i can't ever forget her... but i had to let her go a decade ago... i knew... she knew.... she couldn't contain my emotions... she couldn't contain my pain... my talking about the death of my brother... her thinking about going hiking.... at least she wasn't thinking about her nails... but i still loved her... and still do.... in spite of it all.  and now? i'm listening to 'head on' and the rhythm is nothing compared to the hard grinding wall that opened it... they aren't worried about sounding like anything anymore... just noise and then feedback... and then blues... and then love... and then the music again... and then... iggy in a goddamn set of panties falling down flopping on stage.... i care igster... you were a modern bluejeaned digger to me... the guy who managed to come back from hell to a sober mind.. then come to terms with his personal hells.... me? i don't sweat nothin... a little bit of this... a little bit of that... and my soul is clean.  I've finally vomited up the last of my love for a woman who nearly broke me until i realized she was in the pay of the enemy. Yup. A whore. A woman sent to make me crazy about her but then give up nothin' more then an innocent sweet kiss that meant nothin' to me cuz i wanted to mack on her for like a year.  I'm done... my heart has sold out the only woman i ever really loved... my cia buddies will bash her a bit... but mainly... they'll let her alone... cuz she missed out on the coolest guy that ever lived. namely? me.  end rant 5. tomorrow? rant 6 michigan palace.

Double Danger is one of those grungy background for a breakdown cd's that everyone wishes they had on hand..... you see... you've paid your admission.... you've heard the hype.... and now.... here you are at a stooges concert... and iggy's a drunken sot up on stage doin' his thing..... hammered with every drug known to man and god..... and the only thing in his head is... why isn't the music fast enough.... you see.... ig was tooled for the punk generation.... blazing fast guitars.... and the only way he could keep up with the sounds in his head was to have hammerin' pianos... blazing hippie guitars and a set of drums pounding..... he didn't know what was comin'... his idea of a hard band was KISS.... not that kiss isn't a wall of thunder in itself... but compare kiss to x and you've got it.... blitzkrieg fast music to get loaded to... versus music for loadies.  Now... ig's all broken up that his thang with bowie didn't take off right off the bat.... he got to meet the bloke... but he didn't get to meat him... if yah know what i'm saying... but... some bitches like to play hard to get.... bowie did..... iggy was going to have to go to fuckin' germany to get with the bowienator.... and to do so... he had to earn a little bit of cash along the way.... so here he was.... not wasted.... not loaded with groupies.... just fuckin' kinda buzzed and in a mean mood.... cuz he was gettin' ready to fuck david bowie in the butt for like 10 years.... head on? filled with the grudgefuckiness (is that a word? it'd make a great t-shirt word for japanese schoolgirls) and the piano and drums and everything are hammering away... pretending it's the good old days when iggy didn't have an ego and was just a big ole fuckin' idmonster pallin' with his buds.... now? he's more like if jim morrison was into a heavy metal thing and didn't know how to keep his dick in his pants. That paints a pretty ugly picture..... so let me give you a confidential cia debriefing..... Iggy stopped being a racist about 1973..... it was costing him boot...... and he knew that the indian and black and mexican and hebrew girls he'd get for NOT being racist would blow the tweaked out wp pussy away..... so... he still spewed some shit... but he got deep up the ass of some racist wp bastards and his fbi/cia/nsa/dea/batf tails (of which he'd had millions since detroit when he singlehandedly monopolized his neighborhood's drug deals with marijuana he bought with lawnmowing money) sure... i can sell you a joint fer a buck... led to ok... you want an ounce... that'll be twenny bucks.... and the feds showed up.... and so iggy had to hide out in rock and roll.... it was like a narcotic witness protection program... where the druglords of detroit kept iggy running from town to town so he wouldn't get bored and narc them off.... but the feds kept following him... from town to town... hoping that in the middle of one of his sexual marathons he'd give away the name of Bigguns D. Rambozo... the drug kingpin of the southside who was dealin' drugs from his mommy's stroller.... yup... the baby crimelord of corktown. he used to cut the shit with his formula.... nobody knew that the shit he was swillin' from the bottle was one hundred and fifty percent uncut china white mixed with a little bit of milk so he wouldn't get colicky.  Now... back to ig.... he's all singin' gimme danger..... his love song to BD Rambozo.... little stranger... gimme danger.... he didn't need to be protected... he didn't need groupies surrounding him every minute to make sure he didn't squeal... he needed bowie's ass... to sink his manmeat into and go... i'm ziggyiggy... iggyziggy ... ziggyiggy... iggyziggy.... ziggyiggy... iggyziggy... oooh yeah... ooh yeah.....  now onto led zeppelin.... those buttfuckers were running all over the u.s. givin' iggy's girls the clap. he'd had more shots of penicillin then the average korean war vet.... he was all ready to swell up like a mushroom from all the fungal byproducts injected into him.... and iggy was hot for them.... but with the laid back guys in his band (pussies...) he needed some muscle or bonham would tie him down and robert plant would spend a weekend slapping his dick in ig's face....   that's where kiss comes in.... iggy had to get away from his lounge act for a minute... he had his chops.... and knew where  while up the line (timecorp lingo) he'd be doin' a lounge album or two.... he had to put his detroit metal head back on so that when he met kiss they'd pal around with him for a weekend for some zepp stompin.... that's where iggy was at on 11/?/1973.

The Iguana Chronicles   part 7.2 - Double Danger - NYC Academy of Music 12/31/1973  Light up some incense ya'll.... cuz this is the hippie review you've all been waiting for.... can you say.... double album? i knew you could.  IGGY AND KISS ARE GOING TO BEAT UP LED ZEPPELIN!  IGGY AND KISS ARE GOING TO BEAT UP LED ZEPPELIN! That's what should be going through your head right now.... that's my neener neener neener to the rock critics of the world... cuz nobody! and i mean NOBODY! Not lester 'romilar' bangs, not lenny 'meff' kaye, not patty 'i wuv the trees' smith, not  that stinking asshole bob 'white power's half indian bitch' matheu, not dogshit eatin' christgau.... and especially not fucking jann 'pussy yuppie' wenner, could ever put KISS and iggy beatin' up led zeppelin into a single sentence. They are more concerned with this album has a series of tunes by the igster that in critical parlance are actually the spinoffs of bob wills sucking john lee hooker's dick.   So.... iggy is rockin' hard.... cuz he has just cut a deal with the boys from KISS... all he has to do... is slip them a couple groupies for the trip... and after this new year's eve show.... they'll all fly across the atlantic to BEAT THE LIVING SNOT OUTTA LED ZEPPELIN. Iggy has been gettin' syph from jimmy page's groupie pool..... and HE'S PISSED OFF AS ALL FUCK! Here's what happened to save your asses a bunch of worry and wonder and listening to me blabber while the drugs take effect. They do it... they fly across the channel.... BAP! robert plant get's knocked out with one shot from gene simmon's tongue.... peter criss and paul stanley take on bonham.... he puts up a fight.... but they got INTERSTELLAR FUCKIN' POWERS.... and he's had a few too many boilermakers..... one shot to the chest and then they sit on him and fart for like FIFTEEN FUCKING MINUTES.... john paul jones and ace frehley square off.... screaming bitch epithets at each other until ace gets pissed off and sticks his sparkler up jp's butt.... then he cops a tude and walks out on the whole deal ... sparkler flaring... jp thinking... man... they said they were bringin' some coke-caine... and the main event.  Iggy and Jimmy Page.... Jimmy's all quakin' in his snakeskin boots.... goin.... i promise igster... i'll use a condom next time.... i promise.... pleazzze don't beat me up..... iggy smiles.... straps the tubing around his arm.... shoots up the blue velvet laced Nixon and with the tubing still strapped about his arm loosely... starts swinging on page's head..... page ducks... bobs, weaves... and hides behind the fart reekin' bonham and kiss's version of the muscle shoals rhythm session giggling and passing a joint back and forth as they continue to flatulate all over the unconscious bonham. Iggy sees him hidin' (I SAW YA) and pulls his panties uptight.... cruises for a bruisin... only not his.... and while jimmy page tries to load his bow into the double string guitar to shoot at iggy.... iggy kicks a high flyin' field goal kick to his face smashing his pretty face (until the nights plastic surgery at londonderry hospital) to all hell.  Now.... i bet you want to know about the album.... I'm not going to tell you.... I'm just going to give you the list of songs they played... they... being the stooges. 1. Raw Power, 2. Rich Bitch, 3. Wet My Bed, 4. I Got Nothing, 5. Cock in my pocket, 6. Search & Destroy, 7. Gimme Danger, 8. Heavy Liquid.   The two cd's in this album (here starts my rant about cd's and lp's not being synonymous with album but merely the medium upon which albums are recorded) Ok.... now if someone told you... they just got led zeppelin's new album on 8 track....  would they be using imprecise language? i'd say not.... If they'd said I just got their new RECORD on 8-track... that would be a grammatical error.... but album is a term that goes back to the 78-rpm days... when a series of 78-rpm records would be in a package called an album... like a photo album.... the entire musical piece including liner notes and enclosed booklets was an album.... In the seventies... the album rock format took over... and the stupid fucking dj's (can you say guys named chuck that nobody could shut up in class ended up becoming djs so the psychic manipulating teachers could get them to drop out halfway through school) started thinking album's were lp's. I have a number of albums on cd... i also have albums on cassette... albums on lp... and even a couple of albums in mp3 format (plug for mike watt's fantastic 'corndogs.org' site of minutemen and mike watt stuff)...   ok... that said... this double-cd album (guys like mitch miller and dj's loaded up on coke started calling double-lp albums double-albums cuz they couldn't manage 3 term linguistic elements) is one of the best pieces that i ever listened to while huffing incense.  BEAT THAT YOU GODDAMN PUSSY ASS FUTURE ROCK CRITICS.  setting the standard in literature AND rock criticism for 5 years running!  Kevin Anderson   end rant 7.2. part 8? Kill City and how iggy's dreams were fulfilled and he went back to load up on scopolamine at the feeb factory.   A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles   part 8 Kill City   This album is the greatest. It stands up there with ANY stooges album.  Now, Iggy has spent 2 years dredging bottom.... whose bottom? Bowie's of course. He's kickin' it with a couple beers in him after playing hooky from rehab.... smiling.... lookin' at some chick from the Count Dracula Society.... wondering if those legs go all the way up. And his gals at the UCLA NEUROTOXIN WARD are going to be going apeshit..... Kill City rocks away.... scott thurston of the stooges and james williamson are pounding and flailing away at the keyboard and guitar respectively.... The music is gentler... less desperate... less drug fueled... like some crazed ass surf musicians sittin' back at the record store in their fifties doin' pipeline and chantay. The lyrics? profound.... about the wasted years.... about all the water under the bridge.... like lou reed's late seventies stuff.... not as into nihilism... more into a return to the craft of songwriting. It's infectious.... folks like jackson browne.... supertramp... and the black lips (cuz they're retarded retro-fools plugplugplugplugplugplug). Btw.... after all my rants about how much whitepower/racism suck.... It seems kind of odd for me to drop the black lips into a review... all i can say.... is they're more brainwashed then hatefilled.... like if a black guy walked up to them and started interacting with them at their level... i bet they'd react humanly.... Of course... you gotta realize... a lot of their family/friends are going to do everything (including psychic situational stuff) in their power to make sure that doesn't happen.... but that's beside the point... this is a stooges review.  Iggy's been listening to his leif garrett records.... he's got his tough stance down... he's been kickin' it with bowie.... and bowie did something to him that nobody has ever done before.... he put the igster down so it hurt. Catty little bitch. And now... ig's going through the most challenging days of his life.... dealing with real grown adults instead of his usual adolescent buddies. It's challenging.... his music has grown because of it.... he's thinking about things like social responsibility... the pain that he's been through.... how the drugs used to wipe him out..... that hasn't stopped his fans though.... the first side of this album is like play til' you nod out city.... kill city... sell your love... beyond the law... johanna (my personal favorite of maybe all stooges/ig tunes.) and then the second side.... that just doesn't measure up... but still has moments. My thought? all his fans.... nod off halfway through the album... and then the leif garrett record drops on it from the album changer. A little sidenote.... hunt and tony sales (sons of soupy) are playing bass on some of the tracks of this album.  Now... this opens up a chapter of music that i've never even explored before.... friends of bowie. Here's what tony has to say about bowie....   'They found me basically dead, not breathing, with the gearshift through my chest, and of all the people I'd known and played with, David [Bowie] was the only one who came to the hospital during all that time.' --Tony Sales  this happened AFTER this album was recorded.... tony and hunt spent a few years playing with a group called tony and the tigers... a semi soupy-spinoff band... but it taught them their chops.... and ig probably saw them while stoned and watching the tube back in detroit.... impressed by their musicianship... he brought them in.  Notice something.... I'm not ranting my fool head off on this one.... a couple of sly asides... but hardly the over the top lambast and footshufflin insanity that followed before.... that's because i'm not being driven insane by iggy's out of his mind drug state. He's calm.... I'm calmer.... a reflective pool of mercy.... thinking about how iggy can keep hisself from going full-on bonkers again (like that worked...). I also figure... how can you beat..... awww.. fuck... i'm not going to say it again.... IGGY AND KISS BEATING THE SHIT OUTTA LED ZEPPELIN!   Bowie.... has brought an element of calmness to iggy.... it lasts with him even today.... he's seen someone who has a natural stillness in their life (probably a psychic reaction to bowie's alcoholic mother) am i right about that? i've forgotten so much rock and roll literature i've read... had it blasted out of my mind by 5 years of hardcore political activism/work for the u.s. government.   It seems appropriate though.... after years of an alcoholic family member... usually the result is a measure of calm or a measure of escapism... and bowie has a healthy dose of both. This album isn't about bowie though.... It's about ig having interpersonal relationships that aren't vampiric.... and aren't about his fame or his money... just about his need as a human to relate.... the band seems kinda non-plussed.... expecting the wildman... and finding the shaman. Was ig always that inside? dunno... it'd explain a lot.... the shamanic trick of dragging his buds into the darkest place they've ever been... then bonking them on the head a couple of times with some magic tricks.... then showing them the way out.  Songs about sociopathy.... songs about humanity.... songs about being finished with the horrific drunken splendor of his woohoo younger days. And now? i'm going to lay back and listen to the man who's grown out of his pain.... and into his sanity.  end rant 8. part 9? Jesus Loves the Stooges... I love the 3D glasses.   A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles   part 9 Jesus Loves the Stooges  This is the first review of a rock album to be typed wearing 3d glasses. they came with the album.... some miniature 3d glasses that i have parked behind my specs. Iggy has done it.... made his lounge album.... and here he is doin' an after hours set.... consolation prizes... jesus loves the stooges... and johanna.... a late night groove to get everyone horny so they take home the trolls left at the bar who have been drinkin' their fiftieth bourbon.   I'd buy this album... it's one of the best mini singles of all time.... better then marky mark and the funky bunch... better then madonna's erotica.... better then 'have you seen your mother baby.... standin' in the shadows' better then anything by lesley west and mountain... better then your mom dressed up in the pumpkin suit again.... this album is a winner... and the three-d glasses rock... and iggy makin' david cassidy faces on the back cover rules... and the dead goat in 3d is the most gratuitous use of 3d in any album ever. jesus loves the stooges is playin' right now.... and it sounds like total dogshit.... iggy's voice in low croon... the piano playing a whorehouse grind.... no gitars in evidence. What more can you ask for in an album.... 3d glasses.... iggy doin' teen pinup shit.... and a great whorehouse lounge song.... for after everyone but the whores have gone home..... and he's sittin' there at the barstool singin' johanna.... figurin' he'll go see his girlfriend... for once not a junior high school prom queen.... but a hottie nurse back at the UCLA Medical Center Training Ground for Young Rehab Stars..... James has brought out a couple groupie trolls.... but his hottie back at the lockdown sounds sweet right now.... her roaming in with a pair of restraints and a couple of sedatives.... removing the nurses cap from her tightly clipped blonde locks.... and spreading her legs over iggy's restrained face.....   end rant 9. part 10? Year of the Iguana. and how i learned to love the bimbo.  A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles  part 10 Year of the Iguana  This album is a must-have for any stooges fan. I'd also recommend it for anyone interested in learning about the stooges.  Iggy is in fine form on all 11 tracks on this album.... not one of them sucks....   all i'm going to tell you about what went into making this album is one thing..... a year of mad drugs.   There is no part of this album that doesn't bear the stench of iggy.... rockin' hard as hell in i've got a right.... the edgiest single in a lifetime of edgy singles... the sweetest groove that the stooges have to offer in my book.... grind... loud.... deafeningly cool.... this buzztoned tune is one of those songs that leaves you quaking drenched in adrenalin sweat afterwards....   head on? a fantastic piece of crap... by a true master of schlock rock.... it's got strong moments... but it's not going to destroy your mind.... it's ok.... your mind has already been destroyed and this is just the goosh draining out your ears afterwards......  now.... i'm not going to go through every fuckin' song on this record and tell you what it means to me..... but those two and johanna deserve some special mention..... they are iggy at the height of his powers.... lowercase sex god for all the folks who thought david cassidy was prefab.... he was marketed as such.... created as such... and dumped in the dumpster as such when david's career ended in 1975 after his brother shaun turned out to be more marketable..... they are the same kind of pop fag tagteam that limp bizkit and korn were.... one for the culture... one for the counterculture.... keep your mind empty and your brain wasted and listen to our music... drink beer over here... smoke dope over here.... and then.... something happens... and they realize they were prefab.... so they start putting out music that defies explaining..... david cassidy doing kris kristofferson tunes.... iggy doing lounge music.... korn doing adidas commercials... limp bizkit on mtv acting like spuds mckenzie. They learn to revel in their relative emptiness but full on gonzo love for the medium that brought them into the limelight.... namely... music.  Ig is chanting monotonically into a microphone.... the sixties long behind him... the seventies splayed out in front of him like a train wreck.... is that the kind of stuff you want to hear? it's the kind of stuff the kids want to hear...... am i playing to my audience? you betcha.... you see... i'm the dark side of britney.... for the kids who just can't get into her poppy princess persona... i'm the dark psychic god that ate the world's soul and regurgitated back up a ton of meaningless garbage and hardcore political ranting. here... let me show you..... http://groups.google.com/groups?q=docmartian+israel+dogshit&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search see... i'm evil... i'm bad... i'm here to keep the israelis from slaughtering palestinian kids and dressing up in headscarves and killing israelis. What does that mean? dunno dude... just rock out... turn up the music till yer brains leak out your ears....   for the rest of you... realize.... i am the anti-pop... i am satan.... she is satin... and i love her forever... but i still think yer dumb!   end rant 10. part 11? Wild Love.... and how britney and iggy had the same psychic handler.   A real time odyssey into iggy's world circa 1970ish.  The Iguana Chronicles  part 11. Wild Love   Nothin' new. Just goin' crazy listenin' to another stooges album. That's what i'd tell my girlfriend if i had one... but i don't.... so i'm writing you morons. Now.... what do you think this whole passle means.... means 'grow up'. Maybe i'm telling myself that.... cept i'm feelin' pretty mature these days... taking an accounting class.... sober as fuck... except for an occasional pop of coca-cola or a bunch of hops..... i pound three pabst n/a or an o'douls... or something else to sate my hopsjunkie mind. Yup... you got it... I'm a hops junkie.... i get all twitchy if i don't have some tasty mind destroying non-alcoholic hops beverage to soothe my soul.... put me into a slow trance... and keep my mind flyin' cool with a sweet summer afternoon in a can. Grow up. it's what bowie told iggy.... and he pretty much did.... stopped running around all stupid trying to make people 'his bitch' and made people become a lot more mature in his circle.... workin' at the music... and playin' a great whorehouse boogie... Pin Point eyes.... another sound of the ancient stones forgot. they were concerned with the barrelhouse.... poundin' down a ton of rocky brews and thinkin' about how they can get some more money.... ig's trip? drinkin' weren't nothin.... the girls needed some... and he needed more girls.... and here comes the blues rant.... nothing is new in my world.... nothing is new in his world.... nothing is new in my soul.... nothing is new in his soul.... but somehow... iggy understands that i respect him now.... cuz he's got this fucking groove going on that just makes my soul swell with pride to be musically literate...... rock and roll was never like this... even though the instrumentation is vintage carl perkins..... the rest of it is fucking louis jourdan pissing on sidney bechet's head as they roll around in the dirt fighting over the last whore.   Pin Point Eyes. Listen to it... then shut the album off.... you'll never hear better.  The rest of this album? not bad... not great... but Pin Point Eyes. Worth every goddamn penny i didn't spend on it. Well i woke up this morning... and i was flat on my ass...... she looked into my pin point eyes.... she looked into my pin point eyes.... and all of jim morrison's desperation... jacking off in the bathroom of the roadhouse.... and mick jagger's peakin' through the window of the churchhouse with his electric guitar up his butt.... and lee michaels at the malt shop and bob wills at the minstrel show... and elvis checkin' out some chick gettin' boned to a charley patton record... and johnny cash watchin' his brother die after bein' tore up by a ripsaw... and me watching my brother die after being poisoned by israel with cancer drugs... and none of us knowing the blues the way iggy does... the workhorse of hard work... the mindless drudgery of 15 hours in front of an amplifier.... the torture of having his earplugs drain sweat onto his neckhole where he's been shooting some rotten shit that doesn't even deserve the name of scag.... and i have to smile.... because all of us... are steeped in the blues..... i am the legs of the blues... walking bandylegged for 15 miles stretches..... fleeing from my heart.... the heart that aches every time i see a dead palestinian kid... the heart that aches when i see israel funding some bitch militant puppet group to attack their kids so they have an excuse to keep leeching money off the u.s. the sadness eludes me... the pain is real..... a friend just told me she was loaded as fuck and had shot her boyfriend.... did she? i don't know... it was a psychic message.... i haven't a clue whether she could or not... but the sadness is beyond me.... it must be something like the rage and sadness of war.... but without the release.... i see the people die... but i can't fight back except one way.... with a giant fucking hammerblow to their economy.... ig did it differently.... he started running around with fuckers in nazi suits.... just to protest israel's 1967 and 1973 landgrabs..... and jessy? she does one thing i don't understand.... she puts a drug into her arm.... and then turns the world into a soulvibe..... i'll never understand.... i don't even lust for it.... but i know it's a weird hellmystery that i will never partake in.... it's just as strong and vital to her sanity as kicking israel's ass is to me... and probably just as likely to kill her.... i love her.... she's sane.... so am i... just different.... ig' is too.... his madness was in trying to play rock and roller instead of musician..... i think we all go through a schizophrenic state at some point in our lives where we try and live like someone else.... i tried to live like this crazy ass kid who was determined to prove his manhood by working as a mechanic instead of getting his rocks off with lasers (cuz he thought it made him wuss or something) but i don't understand him either.... i don't understand my moms.... burdened with a dead son and another son that few people even try to approach after his years of wild. Not that i'm a burden so much as finding my way.... it isn't work.... i've worked my ass to the bone.... come home with nuthin' it may be getting a degree..... it may be selling my work.... it may be pickin' up a guitar on the right day of the week.... but i guarantee you it isn't hanging my ass from a rope like i thought a few years ago.... yes.... i was dead a long time ago.... but now... i'm alive again.... jesus christ.  now. ig. is the groove that we all faced. when we thought that it was ok to jack off at anything that moved and call her a dynobot with a megabutt.... he's 12 years old inside.... i'm 15 years old inside... jess? is eternally 7... cuz that's about how old she was when she got raped. age doesn't matter... but our hearts do.... and mine is failing.... i don't know why.... just that there are levels of pain and compassion that are beyond us all that sometimes approach us..... i've had two such deep pain (deep rollers?)  people approach me lately..... terri schiavo and jessy drastic jessy hides her pain better... terri's is on the outside... and what am i going to do? explore it? nope. you can. I'm through with it... i love them... i can't help them... i can't help anyone.... i can't help britney getting ogled by her father naked at 9 years old... i can't help iggy getting fucked in the head by a whole bunch of goddamn crazies including me.... i can't help jessy... saner then anyone i've ever met on one hand.... but hammered out of her fucking mind with drugs till her heart stops or something deep in the heroin world..... and meanwhile.... to you... i just have this to say.... buy this album. it's a great document of the deep stillness and pain inside of us all.... even if it doesn't click right away.  b.d. rambozo.... the drunken sage that he is today... had one thing to say.... 'every man in his witness is witless' and i'd have to agree.  end rant.          ",3.351,4.749,4.176,0.575,0.604,83.704,10.433,0.054,0.892,0.055,6.115,7.68,4.0,2
"           Date: Monday, March 15, 2004  Hello everyone please read this when you can.  Take a break, grab a tissue and as always thanks in advance for ‘listening’.  Ok I’ve written Adrian’s Final Days as a prologue to Our Cancer Story.    It’s the section that's meant to give the most strength, but you might not get it without reading what’s to come, rather I should say ‘what happened 5 years ago’ when Adrian became a miracle cancer survivor.  These final days churned inside me yet it’s the hardest part to share.  But now on the 15th of March 2004, six months to the day and date Adrian died (where I can feel his death, and his love so clearly) it’s the ideal time for me to write of that inconceivable day where my beloved husband Adrian took his last peaceful breaths (thankful beyond belief for the peacefulness of the end).  The memories of the final hospital visit appear so clearly, as I listen to Coldplay sing (the disc that played continually in Adrian’s small hospital room and daily at home all spring during dinner).  “For me all the movements are starting to fade.”     How do you capture death?  It is a part of life, true (though fortunately we don’t see death that often).  From death life grows, well we do see that with the seasons (but give me a break!).  From death we learn (the hardest and deepest of life’s lessons) so much we didn’t want to know.  From death the earthquake ruptures continue for a lifetime (but surprisingly the love continues too grow too).    When the person you love stops breathing, albeit peacefully, when you are holding hands, and saying how deeply you love the person that’s dying, how could that not be intimately special?  How can that not also be terrifying, but it wasn’t, for some reason (though later it seemed too horrible to believe).    Was I a lucky person to be alive, to be holding the hand of my sweetheart rather than those poor families of Sept 11th who never got to say goodbye?  Those who had love taken so violently, well my peaceful goodbye felt oddly blissful only in comparison.     “Nobody said it was easy, it’s such a shame for us to part”  (that’s for sure) but  “nobody said it would be this hard”  (unbelievably difficult to say goodbye).  The lyrics again weave through my train of thought.  I hear Adrian talking to me, saying these exact words; I can even hear his voice.  I truly believe this music is Adrian’s spirit talking to me now from the ‘other side’.    Thinking back to Adrian right now on Monday the 15th at 11:30 am, serene as you can imagine (laying on the hospital bed, without the tubes to keep him alive).  Breathing as though he were snoring.   Snoring for his last occasion in his physical body.    His body that had crashed on him, which had completely let him down (though he continued to be such a pleasant man), that no longer allowed him to do things in life he enjoyed.  Adrian’s strong spirit and our deep love, kept him going longer than most people could’ve in a body that barely functioned.    There is one major thing I learned from 'Adrian' during those painful last moments (something that became clear, which I’ll share with you now, so you can easily disagree).    All living creatures are so much more than just a Body!    We are actually in a body combined with a Spirit (that's everlasting too) which inhabits that body.    In death our Spirit remains behind, 'crosses over to the other side' you could say, to borrow a John Edward term, and stays with our loved ones still here on Earth.  Of that there is comfort, just so much comfort when a loved one dies too young.    And I feel Adrian’s spirit and love alive with me 6 months later and ever so strong.  He just wouldn’t have made it these extra 5 miracle years in his body if it weren’t for his good nature, amazingly strong spirit and the love we shared.    And then I hear the lyrics  “come on in, my star is fading, I’m swerving out of control, I’ve got to get up out of this hole”  and I feel as though Adrian is talking to me about how he felt as he lay dying, as his spirit came free from his physical body.    I can feel him lying peacefully on the hospital bed, while I held his hand and stroked his forehead.  I hear him saying, though he couldn’t talk while he was in the final coma,  “Kathy, I’m at peace, take care of Rebecca, I know you will, I love you.  You’ve given me so much happiness and love.  And you must know that my spirit will be here with you and Rebecca always” .    And in my heart I know that was going through his mind.  Oh my love, my heart breaks for you, my heart aches for us, but that is a physical ache.  I now realize your spirit is here in our home and with me always.    But if the rational part of me could know that you are ok, could keep getting signs that your spirit is by my side, then I could be comfortable with the feeling that we are together forever.  And in my most connected moments I know our love is linked eternally (in my non-connected times I’m angry at you for leaving us).  The words (whose words?)  “Parting is such sweet sorrow”  so aptly describes saying goodbye to Adrian, the love of my life.  And now I understand the depths of those words, as though the words themselves are crying.  And again I hear Adrian talking to me in the lyrics,  “I miss you, I miss you”  and despite this being difficult to write, it’s also cathartic for my distraught system.    Trying to deal with reality, trying to learn a new way to live, missing an essential limb, but learning to tune into the Spirit.  And then the lyrics that talk to me most, making me think of that small hospital room  “come on in, I've got to tell you what a state I'm in...”  and I vividly feel those last moments (it’s happening now, isn’t it?).  To understand the loss, and the surprising peacefulness that Adrian’s death brought, you must peek with me into the 12-day Virginia Mason hospital experience.  Please stop and grab a cup of decaf (or whatever you drink) and take a break from your daily life.  It would be important to me if you please (while your reading and living) make an extra effort to appreciate your loved ones.    On a warm fall Thursday afternoon in early September, Adrian in horrible condition was transferred from Group Health Eastside (GH, where he'd been for 3 days, getting quickly worse) to Virginia Mason (VM, that had more specialty care).    This would turn out to be his last ambulance ride.  The terrific doctor on duty (the end of a weekly rotation), a strong middle-aged woman, eager to get information from me that she couldn’t read in the lengthy reports sent from GH.  But Adrian, in a ghastly state when he arrived around 1 pm, didn’t even know what was happening; he had retreated to an altered consciousness that happens when your body is experiencing too much continued pain.    The nurses said that his feverish condition, his excruciating pain, bruised body, and toxic blood were the worst they’d seen in a middle-aged patient (and these were well-trained older nurses).  To simplify it was beyond terrifying to see Adrian’s awful circumstances.    The memory is so scary (yet strangely comforting as it was the last days of Adrian’s life), and very difficult to put to words.  The situation seemed so terrible and to make matters worse Adrian was having trouble breathing (gasping and gulping for air), and horribly his mouth (and his whole body) was bleeding.    But it was so difficult because we couldn’t give him water (the likelihood of needing the respirator later in the night).  That period before the respirator is so horrendous with the discomfort and continual gasping for oxygen.  That was by far the 'worst' of the final days.  In addition to his full body bruising and bleeding mouth, he couldn’t bear to be touched (because of the bruises and the not yet diagnosed cancer). I’ve never in my life been so scared (having a gun held to my head in college, nothing!).  Seeing my most beloved suffering like that was like an 7.5 earthquake shaking below my feet and destroying the very ground I ‘barely’ stood on (literally it often felt as if the floor itself were caving in).  I can still remember the doctor getting tears in her eyes (how often does that happen?) while we looked at the x-rays and planned a battery of tests and treatment plan.  I felt brave, we had done this 5 years ago, and a person had to be stronger after 5 wonderful years, right?  (Well if I felt so brave, why was I desperately holding onto my reeling sides?).  Besides if I didn’t try to isolate the facts, and make sure things were being done right for Adrian, well then I would’ve ended up collapsing to the ground and falling apart like a hysterical person.  And there were just too many details to keep straight, that it really wasn’t an option for me to become a screaming banshee, not even late at night or in traffic.    ‘My’ treatment plan was to stay as calm as possible and make sure everything was being done right on behalf of Adrian (and hence our life together).   Certainly my calm attitude was a major change from 5 years ago, one of many positive changes that happened as a result of being a cancer survivor (but who needs that kind of shit to be strong, I could be strong with out it).  Well that first Thursday night after I got the call around 8 pm requesting permission to put Adrian on the breathing tube, I felt an enormous relief (which is a treasured feeling when the world is spinning out of control).  I mean the poor guy couldn’t breathe and was so uncomfortable; anything to sedate him, I knew would make him happy, even if it would hurt and make it harder to swallow later.  I also took solace in the fact that he had survived life support 5 years ago; I told myself “he can easily survive this hurdle again.”  I innocently believed recovering from the breathing tube was something he had conquered once and could do again.   Especially since he just lived through the extra 5 really good years after battling cancer and he had a fantastic relationship with Rebecca, how could he not have the ability to fight back?  Didn’t all the love we shared give him additional strength to do the impossible a second time?  Little did I know that his body had fought longer than most humans could have, he was really at the end, and his body was completely used up.  Friday moved along slowly with Adrian sedated on the breathing tube and I felt gratefully calm, as though there was a chance to recover, to breathe and rest.  Over the weekend Adrian showed some steady improvement while he remained thankfully under a golden haze of powerful drugs.   On Monday as they tried waking him up from the heavy medications (in order to get the breathing tube out), they encountered problems.  He skidded downhill quickly with sweaty high fevers and increasingly toxic blood.    Tuesday was our 14th anniversary (even then I felt grateful to be reminded of that special day and our love so true), and Adrian slowly woke from sedation in horrible pain and confusion.  It was so unfair to him (and honestly me too), I can now stomp my feet on the ground like an angry 6-year-old.    Remembering talking to Adrian, letting him hear my voice and calm him, but it seemed so futile, though my voice did steady the beeping monitor somewhat.  Adrian was so highly agitated it was stomach-churning scary; I kept gripping my sides as though I could squeeze away the fear (and assure myself of this awful reality).  Yet he showed me his true strength then, and I learned from him too as I had through all of our 14 married years together.  Thankfully Tuesday night the doctors agreed to put him back on “long term” sedation, and at the same time he slipped into a coma.  Again I felt relief wash over me at the thought of Adrian’s body being peaceful again.  How could you not separate from your body, when it was so flaking?     The coma, the only state Adrian could be in from that point forward, (his state of suspended relief) I could sense a greater peace about him.  This peace and feeling of love settled over his body, the energy so apparent upon entering the room.  He had given up on the most worthwhile fight of his life, and I believe he felt complete and peaceful for living a good life.  That energy I could feel from my home and upon entering his room.  And through the last tumultuous days I somehow stayed glued together, for Rebecca, to cope with the massive amount of information, to drive the 20 miles across the bridge to and from the hospital.  What if I had fallen apart and cried, hysterically like I probably needed to?  Then I would’ve missed so much about the care being given to Adrian but also I don’t think I would’ve heard what was in my heart.    Well somehow, though I did not think it possible, I found strength when I needed it most.  I mean who would have imagined me 20 years ago handling something like this with dare I say grace or dignity?  (I don't know about that?)  But somehow I stayed calm.  On the other side of the pendulum my eternal question has become: “How much did Adrian hear while in his coma?”  Since sound is the last sense to go, in my heart I believe (and hope more than anything) at some level Adrian heard me say how much I love him.    I do believe his spirit was present too giving us strength as he crossed over (just an unbearable situation). “Yes” some far more certain part of me shouts, “his spirit is still here with us”.  And somehow his spirit communicated the “I need to be free” feeling that was so powerful upon entering his room.    And it was that final Thursday I dramatically realized Adrian’s body would not make it, that this wasn’t an ordinary hospital visit.  After talking to Dr Lewis, and then the nurses, I realized that the newly diagnosed level of cancer  (T-cell Lymphoma) added an even greater complexity to an already enormous burden.  Despite the peaceful feeling in Adrian’s room, it slowly started dawning on me as I drove to the fitness center, worked out, and had a mini-meltdown in the parking lot (I started crying when someone pulled close to my car).    It dawned on me that we had to be realistic; there was no way on this earth, no miracle that would allow Adrian to survive this trauma to his body again (strong as I believe his spirit).  He was going to die very soon, I wrote in one of the last email updates, which prompted Martyn’s (Adrian’s brother) 6,000-mile flight to Seattle.    Most importantly I needed to find a way to make this easier for 6-year-old Rebecca.  Her and daddy were ever so close and had so much fun together.  I talked as much as she would listen about Daddy’s spirit being strong, but his body giving out.  She absorbed a lot really, kids are so intuitive, and my favorite comment became “so that means Daddy’s Spirit is on the school bus and at school with me?”  By his final Friday, Adrian’s body had completely crashed; overridden with cancer, he couldn’t tolerate dialysis (which can be pretty rough—all your blood essentially flowing out, through a machine and back in can do a number even on healthy people).  His body went into heart aneurysms when they tried to do anything to ‘help’ him.  There was a ‘do not resuscitate’ order, his doctors agreed that if his heart went, then the strongest part of his body had finally given out, it was time to let him go.    Friday night Dad and Nancy drove me to the hospital.  A second visit seemed like another chance to say my final private goodbyes.  The situation was so confusing; we thought he would die early that evening, then that night, then over the weekend, but he hung on. That Friday night at the hospital, I didn’t know if I should stay or go.  In hindsight it is one of the only times I wish I had stayed (I don’t wish for much these days, that’s a survival sort of thing).    At that exhausting and confusing time, I felt as though Adrian’s spirit had already separated from his body, and there was nothing I could do for his body by staying there, and after 30 some odd minutes of changing point of views, I decided it was best to leave (oh but part of me says why didn’t I stay there with your body, it was your body after all, and hold your hand, and listen to music with you, it was your body, just full of tubes and wires).   Somehow I needed to be strong and stay together during this uncertain period.  Martyn was arriving Saturday night (making the situation all to real) leaving his home Friday morning.  He traveled 6,000 miles from Guernsey to be there by Adrian’s side.   Martyn didn’t know what happened on Friday and how close to the end it was for Adrian, and I worried, actually I was one big knot.  I threw myself into therapeutically cleaning our house for a visitor (hadn’t been cleaned for over a month, before we left for Guernsey, a lifetime ago) and stepped away from the email updates.  Where once they were so helpful, at the end of Adrian’s life I had to be quiet and turn inward.  Well Adrian stayed alive for another sunrise, he knew really, always had an excellent sense of timing.  Sunday was the most emotional of all the hospital days.  How do I begin to convey the sense of solemn enormity?  We had a “family meeting” at noon planned with Dr Lewis (the oncologist was supposed to be there but the cancer was so far gone he didn’t show up).    In a solace room, with myself, Martyn, Sandi and Jeff there too thankfully.  The lights were low, the atmosphere thick with troubled and heavy hearts.  Determined to stay calm (maybe it was the book, Wrong Rooms, I’d just finished about someone who hysterically fell apart as soon as their loved one died?  I just could not let myself become a blathering fool, as I never would have stopped crying, but it was a natural sort of thing too).  My total focus was staying calm.    The doctors told Martyn that Adrian’s body had given out; a T-cell lymphatic cancer so severe over rode his system, it would be an injustice to even biopsy; there was no treatment, he was very close to death.  The fact that he couldn’t breathe, his organs didn’t work, his highly toxic blood was killing him, made keeping him alive inhumane.  What did Martyn want to do?  But Martyn had seen Adrian fight from the brink before and he had more unrealistic hope.  Really the question was posed to me, I “knew Adrian best, what would he want, what did he want?”   All eyes were turned to me, what did I say?  Gulp.  Well I knew the answer; Adrian did not want to live like a vegetable, which was one of those deep things we thankfully talked about over the years.  I believed he wanted us to continue on without him.  I knew he didn’t want to fight a cancer battle, with protracted time in the hospital and being sick.  He wanted quality of life, which we blissfully had for five years after his last cancer recovery.  He didn’t want to fight a battle that there was no chance of winning.  Better to have us all remember him as healthy and with us, rather than remember the last years as hospitals and sickness.  He had even recently pleaded, one night before the hospital experience started, after he had thrown up for the umpteenth time “please let me die” and he repeated this phrase.  At the time I thought he was being dramatic (he’d been through a lot over the years and never made that claim before), but no, this was his last wish.    I knew in my heart there was no way for his body to continue (though part of me desperately wanted a miracle turn around such as five years ago).  Yet I also knew Martyn was in shock, day seemed like night, he had traveled an exhausting rate.  I looked in Martyn’s eyes, and with as much kindness as I could muster, asked what he wanted to do with Adrian.  Everyone kept steering the question back to me, “it’s what you want Kathy, you know what Adrian would want”.  And because Adrian was such a pleasant and tolerant man, I knew we needed to give Martyn time, and give Adrian’s dying body one more try, hopeless as that seemed.  I authorized a ‘gentle’ dialysis run with a ‘do not resuscitate’ order (maybe his body would tolerate the needles, the shock, maybe his blood could get clean and maybe pigs could fly?).  I mean getting Adrian set up for a dialysis run seemed stupidity and cruelty at its finest.    That last Sunday, the thought of needlessly prolonging Adrian’s pain tore me up, very simply.  I was devastated, I felt horrified that I’d betrayed him.  I felt like we’d kept him alive beyond what was humane and far beyond anything he would want.  The thought of him lying wasted in the hospital room, totally connected to tubes, being kept alive by machines, just ripped me apart.  I was the most agitated I’d been in years, totally torn up.  The recent miracle five years evaporated like water in a desert.   “Come up to meet you, tell you I’m sorry, you don’t know how lovely you are”   is playing now, and I’m there on that Sunday.  The small hospital room (with ugly cream walls and a tiny window facing another complex; no amount of pictures and cards could warm the room) that housed Adrian’s body, so close to death, you could feel it from the hallway.    In the corridor, I sought out Dr Lewis and frantically told him   “I will not be there when it’s time to pull the breathing tube.  I want nothing more to do with this.  It’s just so horrible, and how can Adrian continue like this?  We are being so cruel to put Adrian’s body through another dialysis run when it won’t even do him any good.  Adrian’s suffering so and I don’t want him too and I won’t be there when he dies!”     To Dr Lewis’s credit he stayed calm, listened, and patiently told me what it would be like when we pulled Adrian’s breathing tube and let him die.  He talked to me calmly and in a comforting fashion.  There was to be a great deal of uncertainty, he emphasized we didn’t know ‘how’ things would happen or the ‘timing’.    Hospital time felt like a week for every minute and I felt as though time was moving in slow motion, with the minutes stretching through eternity.  Every minute seemed like interminable long days, time stood still, frozen.  I felt like I occupied some surreal place and time, where minutes stretched and filled with internal elongated horrible sobs.   “Come on in, I’ve got to tell you what a state I’m in”  and that’s what Adrian was trying to tell Martyn that long intense Sunday before Adrian died.  It’s what I’d heard Adrian saying to me over the last weeks at home and even on our trip to Guernsey.  It’s what I hear day after day as I listen to Adrian on this CD, talking to me through the music of Coldplay.    Sunday evening Martyn and I talked for hours as though we had some control about when Adrian would die, and what would be most humane treatment for someone you love who is already as good as dead.  We talked about what Adrian would want; I really think I had to convince Martyn of the right path, because Martyn had seen Adrian recover before.  But sadly Martyn had not been with us 5 years ago when Adrian learned to walk again and had to battle the ravaging effects of chemo on a body that already had 2 transplanted organs.  It was a tough battle, one that in my heart I knew Adrian did once, and that was enough.  We talked about things I hope you never have to discuss.  To make these decisions when it’s nature that has to flow its course is beyond ridiculous.  Yet somehow I found the strength to plow through the tidal waves of painful emotions.  I went to bed that Sunday so purely upset, feeling like someone was continually punching my gut.  The hours before Adrian’s death were such an awful and chilling time.  I awoke Monday morning with my period and some renewed inner strength. How was this possible given the intense situation?  Could period onset be this dramatic (never such a swift change from PMS to calm)?  By some means I felt the combination of Adrian’s and my spirit making me feel strong and capable.  Yes my hormones felt evened out, I felt level and able to deal with the death of my most beloved husband (though who is really ever able to deal with that day, what a sad joke!).  Yet as I woke, I clearly heard Adrian saying  “Kathy, set me free, I need you to set me free, I’m almost free of this body, I’ll be able to soar, and I’ll always be with you.”    And from somewhere, I have no idea where, I got strength to get up with my 6 am alarm that last day, shower (do all those things we take for granted that seemed a surreal effort) and speak out loud to the doctor my decision to  “remove Adrian’s breathing tube, remove him from life support” .  Intensely focused on calmly saying goodbye, that took an unbelievable amount of energy.  Very narrowly focused like a racehorse about to run her most important event.  If I allowed myself to wander, my thoughts would start  “it’s only 2 weeks since he entered the hospital and before our life seemed normal, not like it would end so quickly”.   Too terrifying to go there.  That mild Monday we arrived at the hospital around 11 am with such heavy hearts and a sense of the surreal.  The newly rotated doctor (who I didn’t have an easy familiarity with or any respect yet) walked us through “the procedure” again.  Very kind and gentle.  Lots of morphine.  They could not say how long Adrian would survive (hours or doubtfully days).  We left the room while the specialist took out Adrian’s breathing tube.    Time stopped (how could life be moving in the hallway when my love was on his death bed?) and I stood there uncontrollably shaking. I observed and tried to write in my notebook (I needed to ‘document’ the moment, I needed to ‘survive’ the moment and writing helped me somehow cope).  We got the word to come back into Adrian’s room.  I felt those stomach punches going insistently.  The nurse gave Adrian another morphine shot, and took the rest of his IV’s out.  It was the first time in 2 weeks (what seemed like 2 years in slow motion hospital time) that I’d seen Adrian without tubes in his body.  This was finally the Adrian I knew and loved, well the body of the man I loved, with his spirit hovering.  And he peacefully slept.  He snored, I held his hand, the music played, time stopped, I stroked his head, I told him how much I loved him.  The moments were intimately poignant.  Martyn was saying something I didn’t feel right about, “you’ll be ok” but it didn’t matter as long as I could hold Adrian’s hand and tell him I loved him.  When Martyn left the room to give us time, you could literally feel the bliss of our wonderful lives together.  And what I felt most strongly was the love, the love that we shared, and the love that could never die (I never knew love doesn’t die, that’s something else I’ve learned).  From 11:30 am when I stopped writing to 12:30 pm, I held Adrian’s hand, stroked his head, and told him how much I loved him.   That hour in the hospital was equivalent to a year in real life.  I didn’t break down, I didn’t scream “please don’t leave me, I can’t live without you”.  And do you know what, I didn’t consciously think of ‘not crying’ or ‘not getting hysterical’.    I suppose I could’ve screamed and gotten frantic, but I didn’t (which was out of character if I’m to be honest).  In retrospect I went in there with all I had, to be present in the moment, and ‘loosing it’ would’ve distracted me from being with Adrian.  And in looking back I’m so grateful that I didn’t fall apart, and I’ve the feeling that Adrian is eternally thankful too.  I repeated to Adrian, “I love you, I’ll always love you”.  I felt his peacefulness; I can still feel that peace about him months later.  Despite our bleak surroundings, I felt like all the mornings we had lain together, the mornings I had woken in his comforting arms, the many mornings we had intimately talked.  It felt like he was just sleeping (sans the beard that was shaved to make the vent easier) and we would be together for eternity (oh that comfortable good feeling I used to experience daily).    In reality his body had been letting go, but surprisingly I felt our souls would be together forever, I could feel that clear as day.  His last breaths were so peaceful; I could honestly sense his quiet loving spirit filling the room.  The part of me that thankfully surfaced days later, yelled “don’t go, Adrian I love you, please don’t go, I can’t live with out you!”    And by the time he took his last breath on earth in this life, we knew.  His heart rate had slowed to almost nothing, then gradually stopped.  I kissed Adrian’s lips one last time, then Martyn came to my side of the bed and we hugged and shed more tears.   My beloved husband had been such a pillar of strength, despite a body that repeatedly gave out, and such a remarkable man.  Once Adrian died, I did not want to be in the room anymore.  Lying there in the bed wasn’t the Adrian I knew, though it was his body (I’ve since learned of people who could not leave the room and their loved one’s body).  But his body was without life, without the essence of Adrian.  Adrian’s spirit though embraced us and moved us gently out the door.   I still needed to leave 7th floor CCU, but the business of disposing of a body takes effort and work and people.  As we stood in the hallway waiting to sign papers, why didn’t I go back in the room to hug Adrian’s body one more time?  One of my many unanswered questions.  The rest of the day was surreal, making phone calls, telling Rebecca (a whole other full story).  I loved Adrian so much, and this too I learned: Love keeps growing, despite the death of a body.  And there is comfort in this.    And simply I could feel Adrian’s Spirit finally free from his body, and his spirit was free to live on and be in our hearts and memories, forever.  If you listen to your heart, you might feel the spirits that are guiding you too.  We all have them with us.  If you are fortunate, one especially strong spirit is the love of your life, as mine is.  My husband Adrian was such a remarkable man, my light and my love and my inspiration.  I remain the luckiest woman alive to have been there and shared the last full 16 years of his life.    And I suppose in the process of one of the worst experiences of my life, it was all part of the plan.  Everything that happened makes sense and fits.  I even managed to develop some respect for myself for surviving in a calm and dignified manner (believe me, I never thought that possible).    And now I realize death is only the end of a life, not the end of a connection.  The spirit of our loved ones is here forever.  Listen and you can hear and see the signs.    To end with a laugh, as Adrian would want, hmmmm, that’s for you Adrian my love (I finally get to be as corny as I want, and don’t need to wash the bathroom rugs as much).  Life can be good again but I’ll always have a huge hole in my heart for you.  But you gave me so many gifts, our love keeps growing.  The gifts, remember and think of the memories.  Thanks so much for letting me share, helpful beyond belief. Thanks for reading.  Any feedback would help me in my healing.  What did you feel after reading this?

"             Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.  I must know at least six women named Debbie.  In my life, certain names seem to re-emerge again and again;  Robert, Kathy, Tracy to name a few.  But Debbie, though the name constantly recurs in my life with new introductions, was one of a kind.  'Kids meet your new step-mom,' my dad announced when I walked in from a hard day in 8th grade.  I was shocked to see him home on a weekday before 7 p.m.  But shock was soon replaced by amazement when my baby blues beheld the long brown haired twenty something woman straddling his lap in one of our two kitchen chairs.  Her jeans were tight and I noticed she wasn't wearing a bra under her tank top.  That particular fact really irked me because I had to beg my dad into buying me a bra a few days before.  All the girls were wearing them at school.  The boys were running their hands up our backs to see if they could snap them.  I was humiliated when one of the most popular boys in 8th grade, Bryant Heflin, tried to pop my bra only to find I wasn't wearing one.  The only thing worse than having your bra snapped by a popular boy, was everyone laughing when he announced you didn't wear one.  I made up a story about how bras slow you down when you run.  I was on the track team that year and didn't want to be slowed down by a bra.  But after much badgering I talked my dad into taking me to Rinks.  The bras were beside the fabric cutting station.  The lady cutting fabric figured out our dilemma when dad bellowed...'Just pick one!' He was uncomfortable.  Neither of us had any idea what size I wore or even how to find out my size.  The fabric cutting lady took out her measuring tape and put it around my rib cage and figured out what I needed.  Dad never shopped for bras with me again.  While I was taking in the newlyweds I couldn't help but notice the fresh smell in the air.  The asbestos tile was white and actually shining.  Our tan pleather sofa, the only piece of furniture in the living room, was now its sole occupant.  The large black amplifiers, speakers, guitar cases, and keyboard were gone.  There was clean laundry nicely folded sitting on the sofa.  And I smelled something cooking.  I knew all the changes were her doing, and I was pleased.  I rushed to my room after a quick hello to see if the changes encompassed the entire trailer.  The double bed was made and there weren't any clothes or trash on the floor beside the bed.  I quickly fell to my knees and looked under the bed.  The true test.  'I counted over 16 bags,' came the female voice behind me.  'You and your brother must really like Doritos,' she said again.  My dad was towering behind her when I turned around.  'I've never seen such a mess,' he said.  'You should be ashamed letting things get like this.'  I knew he was only saying that for her benefit.  He never said anything about the trailer before.  In fact he joined us on the few occasions he didn't have a gig.  Slipping the empty Dorito bag under the bed to keep from making a trip into the kitchen, a whole three steps.  We ate shrimp and corn bread that night.  It was the first time I ever ate shrimp.  Debbie fried it on top of the stove.  The neighborhood cats sat at the kitchen door and meowed the entire time she was cooking.  Since we only had two kitchen chairs, she and dad ate on the brown pleather sofa.  Jay and I ate at the round table in the kitchen.  When Jay and I went to bed that night (on clean sheets) I thought, now this is going to be great.  I think I even offered up a little prayer for dad and his new wife.  I can't say when her tension and anger began exactly.  Just that it started shortly after the wedding vows.  Dad continued his factory job and commute during the week and played music on the weekends.  Debbie moved her things into the bathroom and my things out.  She made a big fuss when she found a jar of vinegar in the bathroom cupboard.  She wanted to know why it was in there.  I lied. Telling her I tried to clean the tub with it.  She looked skeptical because the tub had obviously never been cleaned.  Really, I was pouring that vinegar over Jay's head while he stood in the tub not a week before trying to get rid of his lice.  He was sent home from school with lice and one of my friends told me  vinegar killed it.  So I made him stand in the tub while I poured it into his hair.  He screamed and cried because it burned his eyes.  I told him to shut up and take it.  Dad came home and asked what was cooking because it sure smelled good.  When Jay would bring home notes from his teachers or his report card, I signed them.  When Jay had problems with bullies, and we were trailer court kids, we had lots of bullies...I defended him.  So when Jay came home with lice I (in all my 12 years of wisdom) got out the vinegar.  But I wasn't about to tell Debbie that.  Little things started appearing in the trailer.  A color tv, though used, was one of the best purchases.  We watched 'Battle Star Galactica' on it the first night.  Dad's musical equipment wasn't gone, just relocated to his bedroom.  The amps were so big Debbie had dad put their mattress on top of them.  They called it their nest.  The double bed Jay and I shared was replaced with heavy wooden bunk beds.  I always believed my dad was poor.  Partly because every year before school when we were at Rinks buying clothes he'd tell me Jay and I were too expensive.  And because whenever I needed money for something at school, like having my last name put on my gym shirt, he'd get angry and say he didn't have the money.  But Debbie made my dad spend money on making our home life better.  She didn't think my dad was going to be famous but she knew exactly how much money he made and had no problem spending it.  It wasn't very long before we moved into a trailer across the street.  Jay and I got our own bedrooms (or closets as we called them).  Dad sawed the bunk beds apart.  With the bed in place there was exactly 14 inches of space to move around in each bedroom.  Shortly after the move to the bigger trailer, Debbie stopped going with dad to his gigs.  I don't know what happened in their relationship exactly but Debbie became bitter and angry all the time.  Since dad wasn't around much she chose to take it out on Jay and I with Jay getting the brunt of it.  No more shrimp and corn bread.  Her cooking degenerated to a piece of meat in the crock pot.  She sat in a newly acquired living room chair smoking cigarettes, drinking Pepsi, popping pink hearts (speed) and swinging her leg while wearing her tank top and no bra.  At first she started taking things away from us.  For Jay it was sweets, for me just starting high school it was anything social.  I was no longer allowed to play basketball, run track or go to any games or dances.  She sat in the trailer and expected us to do the same.  Jay would beg for Pepsi and she'd gleefully tell him no while sipping at the one beside her.  I began to hate her.  I tried to talk to my dad about her cruelty because it was increasing and was irrational.  He told me Jay and I were 'heathens' who resented having someone put limits on us.  He said we finally have someone to take care of us and look how we complain.  I realized something very important.  My dad wasn't watching out for us.  Debbie was our jailer and seemed to be intoxicated with the idea of having authority over two other people.  Debbie also realized something very important.  My dad married her to be a babysitter.  She struggled with it, but ultimately accepted it.  She couldn't decide if she wanted to play cool step-mom or evil step-moster.  One day she'd keep me up all night on a school night moving furniture.  Give me a little pink heart for energy and send me off to school.  And the next day she'd be trying to bend me to her will by hitting me with a wire hanger on the back of the legs until they bled.  Her physical violence toward me happened twice.  The first time was with the wire hanger.  I stood completely still and when she was done I turned around to face her.  I was wearing shorts and I could feel the warm blood oozing down my legs.  I reached back and wiped at the blood with my hand, then wiped my face leaving a hot trail a blood splashed across it.  I told her if she ever touched me again I'd kill her.  The second time she hit me was the last time she saw me.  But that comes later.  Debbie was threatened by Linda living a few blocks away.  Linda moved on and was dating another man named Charlie.  Before Debbie became too harsh I was allowed to go out and play with a girl friend named Doty every day.  Except there was no Doty.  I was lying about a make believe friend so I could get out of our trailer and go see Linda.  I spent many hours with Linda, Charlie, Dondie, and Charlie's children.  I longed for dad to get back together with Linda.  She was working at the new Honda plant and making decent money.  She bought a new Firebird, a brand new big as I'd ever seen trailer, and Dondie had an Atari.  We left Marysville toward the end of my freshman year.  Debbie found a trailer court out in the country in another town.  So we moved to Plain City Ohio and I started at Jonathan Alder High School.  I didn't get to say good bye to Linda and I missed my friends in Marysville.  Debbie degenerated into a raving bitter lunatic in the country.  I never liked the way Debbie treated Jay.  Even when she was new and trying to make a good impression, she treated him like an after thought.  After defending him and looking after him for so long, I thought she was too mean to him.  I was a scrapper, I'd fight pretty much anytime anywhere (there is a certain amount of infamy in a fighter and any attention was better than none).  But I was afraid of Debbie for the most part.  So I watched her make Jay sit in his room with his bedroom windows closed in mid summer as punishment for some imagined crime.  I watched as she hit him with belts for using one of her writing pens.  I watched and did nothing but burn inside.    By the beginning of my 10th grade year I knew things had gone too far.  Debbie was not just screaming at us anymore, she was screaming at my dad.  So he wasn't home but a few hours total during the week.  Little things would set her off and Jay was throwing his arm up and cowering every time she raised her voice around him.  I made new friends at Jonathan Alder High School.  They were mostly throw away kids.  Kids whose parents were non-existent or abusive.  The kind of friends who never questioned why I wasn't allowed to go to dances, or ball games, or any school functions.  I was loyal to my friends.  The way I saw it, I didn't have anyone else.  I continued with my stories and was happy when I was away from Debbie and knew Jay was as well.  When we came home from school and walked in the door, Debbie would be waiting.  Sitting in her chair, Pepsi beside her, swinging her leg smoking a cigarette, wearing her tank and no bra.  She'd point to a laundry basket.  We had a washer but no dryer.  So Jay and I would lug the wet clothes to the laundry mat in front of the trailer court 3 blocks away.  I didn't mind the laundry mat.  It got us out of the house.  I'd let Jay go play out front while I did the clothes.  It was right next to the pool so sometimes we'd go out and sit there.  We'd carry the laundry back and go straight to our separate rooms.  They were bigger because the trailer my dad bought was brand new.  My room was a typical teenagers room with a poster of Michael Jackson's Thriller Album on my wall.  Jay's room was stripped of everything but a bed and chair.  No toys or books.  Jay had to sit in his chair until he was called for supper.  Then after supper back to his chair.  Everyday.  If he broke the rules in any way she beat him.  Jay and I took a paper route just to get out of the trailer.  I started getting involved in drinking before school with a girl down the street named Samantha Studebaker.  It was the only time I wasn't under Debbie's thumb.  I can't really say how much honest drinking we did.  We drank mixer for a long time thinking there was alcohol in it.  And instead of taking the bus to school a few guys we knew would swing by and pick us up.  The boys would drive fast and recklessly as Sam and I hung out the windows yelling, 'Cool breeze,' and 'woo hoo.'  Those stolen moments were exhilarating and I wanted more of them.  One day when I rode the bus I mouthed off to the bus driver.  She gave me detention.  The high school was a long way from our trailer court.  And when you had after school detention you missed the bus.  The year before dad bought Debbie a clunker beige four door pontiac.  It had rust around the bottom so he spray painted the bottom of the car black to help disguise it.  Debbie was just learning to drive and listened to Daryl Hall and John Oats on the 8 track.  Since I had detention for a week, I had to find a ride home.  I found a ride for every day except one.  I stood at the pay phone and called every person I knew with a vehicle but no one could come pick me up.  A thunderstorm broke loose just as I decided to walk home, even though it was a 45 minute drive.  I didn't have any choice.  When I walked out the front door of the school building, now long deserted except for the janitor, I saw the Pontiac sitting in front.  I didn't know Debbie was waiting for me, all the longer because I spent at least twenty minutes on the phone trying to find a ride.  I could tell by the way Jay was crouching in the back seat Debbie was in a rant.  I started to open the passenger's side door.  She jerked her arm up and pointed with her thumb to the back seat.  I got in beside Jay.  His eyes were red from crying.  Debbie peeled out and began screaming about how long she'd been waiting.  She was beating her fists against the steering wheel.  'I'm sick of this shit,' she screamed pounding the steering wheel. 'I waited for thirty minutes!'  I didn't say a word.  What was the point?  'You and your brother are worthless!' More screaming.  'Especially you!  You are done!  Do you hear me?  DONE!  You won't step a foot outside our trailer again until you are 18!'  My eyes narrowed.  Three years seemed a lifetime away.  'After the crap you pulled last week, now you do this!'  She was referring to an incident with Tracy DeWalt.  Tracy was a bad girl.  She was chubby, smoked pot, and was pretty tough.  She was one of the girls in my group.  Tracy spent the night with me one weekend.  I never was allowed to have friends over so I should have known something was wrong when Debbie suggested it.  Debbie took her back to the master bedroom.  They smoked pot together on the waterbed and then Debbie pumped Tracy for information.  Tracy told everything.  She told how much I hated Debbie.  How I couldn't wait to leave.  How I wished my dad would divorce her.  And most of all she told about my stories.  The stories I told in Home Economics class about slapping Debbie.  They were stories I wove.  They all centered on me smacking Debbie and telling her off.  A fantasy of mine, something I wanted to do since shortly after meeting her.  No one in the class, which consisted of my group of friends, believed it.  Our teacher, Ms. Bell, just ignored it and everyone seemed to have a story or fantasy of their own.  I remember Ms. Bell teaching us about sewing, cooking, and how to go on a job interview.  She was all of twenty-three, twenty-five at most.  I remember thinking she was incredibly naive and optimistic for one so old.  When Tracy in a stoned stupor told Debbie everything, it was the beginning of the end.  Debbie forced my dad to get off work early and come to the school.  The office pulled me out of class and said the guidance counselor wanted to see me.  It was an ambush.  I walked in and there was my dad sitting in his red jacket just like Burt Reynold's jacket in 'Smokey and the Bandit.' His said Honda on the sleeve.  Debbie was sitting beside him looking like the cat who ate the canary.  She was actually wearing a bra.  I knew then things were bad.  She spent the next hour saying things like, 'You're gonna tell this man and that class you never touched me.  Admit it, admit you never slapped me.'  I didn't say a word but just stared at her.  I wasn't admitting anything.  When my dad saw the mutiny look in my eyes he used his this-is-your-last-chance-before-I-spank-you-voice, 'Admit it!'  I looked at the guidance counselor who was looking ill.  He was the voice on the intercom cracking jokes every morning.  He was always quick with a smile and hug.  He was in over his head.  I knew it and he knew I knew it.  He excused himself after a few moments and returned with Ms. Bell.  Ms. Bell was scared.  I could see the fear on her face.  She was worried about losing her job.  She let us talk in class and now that talking had come back to haunt her.  I wanted to comfort her but humiliation choked off the words.  Only sarcasm remained.  'Can you believe they came all this way because she is worried a bunch of teenagers might think I beat her up?'  I asked in a tone that would have gotten my face slapped at home.  Ms. Bell said, 'It doesn't matter.  No one really listened or believed it.  I didn't believe it.'  Debbie snorted.  She saw the immaculately dressed Ms. Bell and despised her.  Debbie believed in being tuff.  She talked about whipping this woman or that woman, how she rode with the hell's angels and learned to fight there.    Her stories made me afraid.  Afraid to defend Jay.  Afraid to stand up against her alone.  But I could feel inside my gut that one day we'd have a blow out.  She must have sensed it too because she always said, 'When you feel froggy...leap.'  The day I wiped blood on my face and told her never to touch me again was a beginning of sorts for me.  The second time I stood up to her was in the guidance counselor's office.  So after detention a few weeks later, in that two toned Pontiac, on the way back to the trailer court in the pouring rain, I listened to her rant, threaten, and pound the steering wheel with her fist.  Some little voice inside me said, 'It's time.'  By the time we got back to the trailer the storm was in full force.  I was wearing Sam's Lee pin stripped baggy pants.  Dad and Debbie weren't shopping at Rinks anymore, but I still wasn't allowed to go pick out my own clothes.  Debbie did it.  And sometimes she picked to humiliate.  So I borrowed a lot from Sam.  I walked back to my room and Jay to his.  I was leaving.  I picked up the pictures of my friends and put them in my coat pocket along with me Billy Squire cassette tape.  I went to Jay's door right next to mine and looked at him sitting in his chair.  'Get your coat on,' I said.  'We're leaving.'  Debbie heard us talking and came stomping down the hall with cigarette in hand.  'What are you doing?' She demanded.  'Leaving,' I said.  'I'm taking Jay and going to find my mom.  She has got to better than you.'  'You're not going anywhere,' she said.  'Get back in your room.'  'No,' I said.  She held her cigarette out to Jay.  'Hold this Jay,' she said.  I looked at Jay.  'Don't hold it Jay.  You don't have to do what she says anymore.  Today's liberation day.'  She flicked the cigarette in my face and came toward me.  I swung and hit her full force in the face knocking her glasses off.  We scuffled.  She pulled my hair and scratched my face but I just kept punching her face.  All the years of taking her abuse, watching her abuse my brother, my dad.  It all came out.  I raged.  I beat her ass.  She ran into Jay's room.  He ran from her and huddled on his bed.  She screamed, 'You can go.  You can go.  But Jay stays here!'  'Jay goes with me!' I screamed and knocked her to the floor.  Jay got his coat and we left her there, on the floor in his room.  I threw open the screen door on the trailer.  The wind caught it and broke the chain.  It slammed against the side of the trailer as the wind and rain hit me full in the face.  The paper truck was just dropping off our newspapers for delivery when we walked out.  We walked right past the pile of papers and headed for the highway.  Common sense hit me two blocks later.  We were at the edge of the trailer court closest to the highway.  I had no idea where my mom lived.  I didn't even know if she still lived in the state.  I knew we would be reported as run aways.  But I didn't think that was right.  We didn't run away.  We were forced out.  I saw Drachel's trailer.  Drachel and her sister Stephanie were upper crust in our trailer court.  Their parents were still married and they dressed well.  They took piano lessons and their mom was classy because she spoke respectfully to everyone.  I went to the door and asked her if I could use the phone.  She didn't want to let me in at first, soaking wet.  But I was persistent until her dad came to the door.  He told us to come in.  Crying and laughing alternately I told them what happened.  Crying for leaving my dad, and laughing to finally be free.  They didn't know what to do so I suggested they call Children's Services.  I gave them a number I had hidden in the protective cover of my wallet.  A couple months before liberation day, I skipped school for the first time ever.  A good friend of mine moved to Columbus.  She called our group and said she was feeling blue, suicidal.  We all skipped to go see her.  I made the arrangements and told the lie to get a woman who befriended me to drive us there and pick us up later that day.  I didn't know the school called when you were absent.  Debbie took the call and immediately called the police.  She wanted me arrested for being truant.    They were all waiting for me when I came home.  I saw my dad's car out front and knew I was busted before I ever stepped inside the trailer.  The police talked to her and then to me.  They'd spent a good hour or more with her before I arrived.  They pulled me outside at one point so she couldn't hear.  One of the cops handed me the number to a social worker.  He said, 'I can see things aren't right here.  Your step-mom is a little high strung.  If you ever need anything or things get crazy here call this number.'  That one officer gave me something my dad denied me.  Validation.  After only a few short minutes in her presence he knew she was twisted.  Despite skipping school he was on my side.  I took the number and hid it.  That is the number I pulled out and gave to Drachel's dad.  He called it reluctantly, not wanting to get involved.  The police and social services arrived an hour later.   The police took pictures of my face.  Debbie scratched it and tore my clothes.  Some of my hair was missing.  Then the social worker, an obese man in a suit, took me and Jay to a half way house in another town.  It was a house like any house you might see in the country.  Except it was new and had industrial size windows.  We sat down at the kitchen table.  I looked around at the big house at my reflection in the dark glass windows.  I saw a boy about my age peeking around a corner at me.  He didn't come out and was cautious not to be caught.  Jay was twelve but scared.  He sat close beside me.  I didn't know what was going to happen to us.  I did know that it was a beginning.  We were free.    A short round man with red hair and beard came and talked to us briefly.  He took Jay to the boys wing where a few other boys, all teenagers, were sleeping.  I was taken to the girls wing.  There were no other girls there.  The industrial bathrooms were large and clean.  I didn't have a toothbrush or anything else.  Just the pictures of my friends and Billy Squire.  I went to bed and the next morning awakened to sunlight streaming across the bed.  It was quiet.  No one was yelling and it felt good.  I got up and went to look for Jay.  In the large kitchen I discovered you had to earn your food.  They explained a point system to me, but I didn't listen.  This was just a pit stop and I wanted to see Jay.  They showed me around and finally brought Jay out.  I met three other boys.  The one who was peeking at me from around the corner the night before.  And two older boys.  The social worker came to take us back to his office.  My dad was meeting us there.  He was alone when he arrived.  The social worker asked, 'Where is Debbie?'  'She's tired.  She was up all night after the kids ran away worrying.'  Dad said.  I rolled my eyes.  I knew she called the police as soon as we left the trailer.  But to hear my dad take her side before he even talked to us was typical.  'We're all tired,' the social worker said.  'But that isn't a very good reason to miss something this important.  I am deciding today if you will get your children back.'  'I'm not going back,' I said.  'I didn't leave to go back.'  'Can you keep your wife and daughter from fighting?'  The social worker asked dad.  'When I am home,' dad said.  'And just how much is that?'  Dad adjusted his seat and smiled in the way adults do when they are uncomfortable but about to tell you something you should already know.  'Not much.'  'If you send me back,' I said.  'I will leave again.  But this time on my own.  I won't come for help.'  'Shut up,' my dad growled.  'Haven't you done enough?  Debbie told me all about what happened.'  'I bet she did dad,' I said.  'I tried to talk to you about her but you never wanted to hear it.'  'What's to hear?'  He spat.  'You want your own way and when an adult tells you no, you don't like it.'  'I don't like it when its always no dad,' I said.  'Debbie is crazy.  You don't want to admit it because it's easier to just let her kill us.'  'There is the issue of Debbie striking your daughter,' the social worker cut in.  'She left scratches on her face.'  'That is from restraining her!' Dad said.  'Do you think my daughter would be able to walk out if my wife was fighting her?  She'd be hurt a lot worse if Debbie was fighting.'  I knew my dad was choosing the easy way when he didn't respond to my pleas about Debbie.  Somehow that was easier to stomach than the alternative.  But I finally had to face the truth in that stuffy little social worker's office.  My dad was choosing Debbie, not just the easy way, over me and my brother.  Choosing her and clinging to her like a dying man in need of water.  I wasn't about to sacrifice my life for his illusions.  'Mr. Thomas,' the social worker said.  'Debbie is an adult and should know better than to fight with a minor.  She chose to fight.  That's called child abuse, even if the child fights back or initiates.  The adult can always walk away.  The adult is supposed to use better judgment.'  Dad shook his head.  Not even the social worker would convince him Debbie was wrong.  At the end of the meeting the social worker determined dad couldn't protect me so the state of Ohio took custody.  When Jay was asked what he wanted to do dad insisted he go back home.  I looked at Jay and he nodded.  I couldn't believe it.  I wondered if something happened at the half way house to make Jay want to go back to Debbie instead of spending another night there.  The social worker warned me that the twelve girls in the group home I'd live in were a 'rough' lot.  What he didn't know about me was that I could fight, and was pretty good at it.  I doubted they were any rougher than the crowd I belonged to at school.  I was willing to risk it.  Since Jay was going back to dad's house I could always leave if I didn't like it.  But I kept that to myself.  At the end of the meeting a court date was discussed.  Jay went and stood by dad.  I hugged Jay good bye and shook my dad's hand.  That was the end of his parental role in my life.  A week later I got to get up in open court and tell about everything Debbie ever did to me and Jay.  She sat there scowling at me with my diary open in front of her.  She believed the judge would give her a chance to speak, to humiliate me by reading my diary in front of the court.  She miscalculated.  The judge never allowed her to speak.  I spoke on record and then Drachel's dad got up and gave his testimony.  He was scared and uncomfortable because he didn't want to be involved.  They moved from the trailer court shortly after the trial.  The most satisfaction I received was when the social worker got up and testified that Debbie was irrational and immature.  He said she wasn't suitable to raise children and the court needed to direct her to parenting classes.  I wanted to jump for joy when the judge looked at her and said in his harshest voice,'Mam you are lucky this isn't a criminal proceeding or you'd be on your way to jail right now.'  She actually started to speak.  He held up his hand and yelled, 'Don't say a word.  I don't want to hear anything you have to say.  Hitting a child and leaving this, he held up a picture of me taken from that night (and I looked really bad because it was raining and my hair was wet and clothes in disarray) is a criminal act.  I don't care what you think this child did.  She didn't make you raise a hand to her.  You could have let her go and then this would have been a situation for the youth authorities.  But your bad judgment proves you are not fit to raise children.'  I smiled inside and finally after three years felt the light in my soul start to shine again.  The judge continued.  'The only reason I am not taking the boy out of the home is because he wants to stay and I believe this incident will make the father more attentive.  However, the social worker assigned to this case will be making unannounced visits to check on Jay for at least the next year.  I will review the case and report in twelve months to determine if further action is necessary.'  It was over.  I was free.  Jay wasn't with me, but the social worker was going to make sure he wasn't abused anymore.  I won.  The judge ordered my dad to pack my things and have them ready for pick up the next day.  My clothes were in black garbage bags, shredded, the next day when my social worker took me to pick them up.  She destroyed everything else, including all the short stories and poems I'd written over the years.  The social worker drove me out to Sedalia, or Midway Ohio depending on when you lived there before of after the name change.  Sunrise house, a group home for girls.  The girls who would become my world for the next year....but that is another story.           ",3.252,4.581,4.015,0.492,0.558,86.911,11.583,0.076,0.868,0.056,5.941,8.17,3.863,2
"           I am not certain of the original source for this article. I could not find any  definitive  original version of it online. I believe the attribution is correct. I think that what Prof. Harari says is very important which is why I am re-printing the transcript of his talk here.    A View from the Eye of the Storm  talk delivered by Haim Harari at a   meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national   corporation, April, 2004.   Professor HAIM HARARI, a theoretical physicist, is the Chair, Davidson Institute of Science Education, and Former President, from 1988 to 2001, of the Weizmann Institute of Science.  During his years as President of the Institute, it entered numerous new scientific fields and projects, built 47 new buildings, raised one Billion Dollars in philanthropic money, hired more than half of its current tenured Professors and became one of the highest royalty-earning academic organizations in the world.  Throughout all his adult life, he has made major contributions to three different fields: Particle Physics Research on the international scene, Science Education in the Israeli school system and Science Administration and Policy Making.   As you know, I usually provide the scientific and technological 'entertainment' in our meetings, but, on this occasion, our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come. I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information. My perspective is entirely based on what I see, on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years. You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver, which you are supposed to question, when you visit a country.  I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli-Arab conflict. However, I will touch upon it only in passing. I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events. I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco, which is predominantly Arab, predominantly Moslem, but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities.  Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood? Because Israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region. Yes, there is a 100 year-old Israeli-Arab conflict, but it is not where the main show is. The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel. The mass murder happening right now in Sudan, where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens, has nothing to do with Israel. The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilian in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel. Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait, endangered Saudi Arabia and butchered his own people because of Israel. Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel. Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel. The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel. The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on.  The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel would have joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine would have existed for 100 years. The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion. They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe. These 22 countries, with all their oil and natural resources, have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone. Within this meager GDP, the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business, but by being corrupt rulers. The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago. Human rights are below any reasonable standard, in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission. According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates. The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis. Birth rates in the region are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and the cultural decline. And all of this is happening in a region, which only 30 years ago, was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world, and in a Moslem area, which developed, at some point in history, one of the most advanced cultures in the world.  It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline. It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves.  Do I say all of this with the satisfaction of someone discussing the failings of his enemies? On the contrary, I firmly believe that the world would have been a much better place and my own neighborhood would have been much more pleasant and peaceful, if things were different.  I should also say a word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families. They are double victims of an outside world, which now develops Islamophobia and of their own environment, which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional. The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and of the incitement but they also do not stand up against it. They become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others. Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong, but are afraid to express their views.  The events of the last few years have amplified four issues, which have always existed, but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region. These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as 'the undeclared World War III'. I have no better name for the present situation. A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already well into it.  The first element is the suicide murder. Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately. Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon. It is a very potent psychological weapon. Its real direct impact is relatively minor. The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents. September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes. More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started. Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.  So what is all the fuss about suicide killings? It creates headlines. It is spectacular. It is frightening. It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded. It is always shown on television in great detail. One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.  But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer. This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World. The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one. We may arrange for the best airport security in the world.. But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people. Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector? How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period? Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses. Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals. Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves. You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way. And it is a war!  What is behind the suicide murders? Money, power and cold-blooded murderous incitement, nothing else. It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs. No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up. No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself. No relative of anyone influential has done it. Wouldn't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk  their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor? Aren't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven? Instead, they send outcast women, naïve children, retarded people and young incited hotheads. They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead.  Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair. The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa. It never happens there. There are numerous desperate people in the world, in different cultures, countries and continents. Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives, reconnaissance and transportation. There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq then in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself. A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power.  The only way to fight this new 'popular' weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way. Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid. You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer in the street corner. You must go after the head of the 'Family'.  If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism. The United States understands this now, after September 11. Russia is beginning to understand it. Turkey understands it well. I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it. Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders will arrive in Europe in a big way. In my humble opinion, this will definitely happen. The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning. The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable. Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.  The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies. Words can be lethal. They kill people. It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life. But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about. An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a Jewish plot.  You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad. Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic. But to stand, day after day, and to make such preposterous statements, known to everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your own milieu, can only happen in this region. Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time. It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars. After all, if you want to be an antisemite, there are subtle ways of doing it. You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed. But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case. When these same leaders make other statements, the Western media report them as if they could be true.  It is a daily occurrence that the same people, who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them. It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world. Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything. Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows. I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time. You will not believe your own eyes.  But words also work in other ways, more subtle. A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a 'peace demonstration'. You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much. A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill. She then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant. She is called 'martyr' by several Arab leaders and 'activist' by the European press. Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows.  There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called 'the military wing', the one who pays him, equips him and sends him is now called 'the political wing' and the head of the operation is called the 'spiritual leader'. There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media. These words are much more dangerous than many people realize. They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities. It was Joseph Goebels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. He is now being outperformed by his successors.  The third aspect is money. Huge amounts of money, which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world, are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder. In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves. The money funds their travel, explosives, hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets. They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by serving as terror infrastructure. Finally, we find the third circle of so-called religious, educational and welfare organizations, which actually do some good, feed the hungry and provide some schooling, but brainwash a new generation with hatred, lies and ignorance. This circle operates mostly through mosques, madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media. It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal. It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world, for the miseries of the region.  Figuratively speaking, this outer circle is the guardian, which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement, rather than to the world outside. Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from, or blackmail by, the inner circles. The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate. Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20, the most receptive age to incitement, guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred.  Of the three circles described above, the inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes. These states, as well as the Palestinian Authority, are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors. The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations  of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle. The Saudi regime, of course, will be the next victim of major terror, when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle. The Saudis are beginning to understand it, but they fight the inner circles, while still financing the  infrastructure at the outer circle.  Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot. You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers. The Jihad 'soldiers' join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland. Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her daughter, receives tens of thousands Dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, for performing murders at the retail level.  The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws. The civilized world believes in democracy, the rule of law, including international law, human rights, free speech and free press, among other liberties. There are naïve old-fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols, not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war, avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs. Never in history, not even in the Nazi period, was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now. Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy. Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations. Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him? Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers? Does free speech protects you when you shout 'fire' in a crowded theater? Should there be death penalty, for deliberate multiple murders? These are the old-fashioned dilemmas. But now we have an entire new set.  Do you raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage? Do you return fire, if you are attacked from a hospital? Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages? Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets? Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly? Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you, standing deliberately behind a group of children? Do you raid terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital? Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another, always surrounded by children? All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas. What do you do? Well, you do not want to face the dilemma. But it cannot be avoided.  Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would openly stay in a well-known address in Teheran, hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary. I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done, in such a situation.  The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment. It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice-skater into the rink or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player. In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister, because such an act is unthinkable, international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals, mosques and ambulances, while being protected by their Government or society. International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government. International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country, which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him. The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law and define all those who attack them as war criminals, with some Western media repeating the allegations. The good news is that all of this is temporary, because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality. The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder, not during and not after. After every world war, the rules of international law have changed and the same will happen after the present one. But during the twilight zone, a lot of harm can be done.  The picture I described here is not pretty. What can we do about it? In the short run, only fight and win. In the long run ? only educate the next generation and open it to the world. The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force. The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force. Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to women, more education, counter propaganda, boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media, internet and the international scene. Above all, we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil.  Allow me, for a moment, to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science. When you have a malignant tumor, you may remove the tumor itself surgically. You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body, thereby preventing new 'supplies' from expanding the tumor. If you want to be sure, it is best to do both.  But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take Europe a few more years. In order to win, it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people. I do not want to comment here on whether  the American-led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia. Now that Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a Syrian colony. Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list. As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them. Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union. Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel. This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries. It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq. I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the resulting situation.  In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime. It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions. It has an ideology, which claims supremacy over Western culture. It is ruthless. It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using Iranian Embassies.. It is clearly trying to develop Nuclear Weapons. Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the 'good-cop versus bad-cop' game. Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hizbulla and, through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekhistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq. Nevertheless, most European countries still trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals.  In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate. It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaida and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hizbulla, Sadr and other Iranian inspired enterprises. When it serves their business needs, all of them collaborate beautifully.  It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of terror. It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations, to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism. It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or ignorance.  Above all, never surrender to terror. No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result, if not for the train bombings a few days earlier. But it really does not matter. What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq. The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq. In the long run, Spain itself will pay even more.  Is the solution a democratic Arab world? If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to women, free international travel, exposure to international media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, democracy is the solution. If democracy is just free elections, it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory. We have seen it already in Algeria and, to a certain extent, in Turkey. It will happen again, if the ground is not prepared very carefully. On the other hand, a certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China.  I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail. But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be. Europe, more than any other region, is the key. Its understandable recoil from wars, following the horrors of World War II, may cost thousands of additional innocent lives, before the tide will turn.   Food for thought.

"       Scene 1   Opens on a busy dining room of a restaurant on TeagueRoad in Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland. The center of the room is dominated by two large oval teak dining tables, while the cream—colored stone walls are lined with smaller mahogany tables for couples. In an alcove to the rear are four black vinyl booths lit dimly by false candle fixtures mounted on the wall above each booth. To the left of the alcove is a small window looking out on a darkening courtyard. The central area is well lit by three chandeliers and the glowing embers in a huge green marble fireplace on the left wall. On the right wall is an open doorway leading to the front rooms of the restaurant. Antique pale rose trim wraps the top edge of the walls, and is offset by a plush crimson carpet.The tables are filled with patrons enjoying themselves, both farmers and businessmen alike. Several waitresses hover about the tables, while a very attractive slender woman, named Anne Marie, acts as hostess and seats newcomers while supervising the waitresses. She is of medium height and in her early twenties with an classically angular face., Anne Marie’s complexion is a pale white enhanced by a healthy blush on her cheeks, and is contrasted sharply by her short black hair and startling blue eyes. She is casually dressed in brown corduroy slacks and a white sweater with a brown and green pattern about the collar and cuffs, and is wearing white sneakers. A long thick gold chain is draped about her neck. As she makes small talk with the customers, she is approached from the doorway by a robust young woman who is tall with auburn hair. She is named Marie and is slightly younger than Anne Marie. Dressed in a heavy grey turtleneck and jeans with a clean white chef’s apron she moves with Anne Marie to the right side to speak undisturbed.   Marie: ( with a heavy brogue ) I’ll be needing more peppers, as well as white sausage for tomorrow’s breakfast. What we have on hand won’t be near enough.   Anne Marie: ( with a lighter accent ) All right, I’ll run out now before the market closes. ( Marie turns away to go back to the kitchen ) Oh, and Marie, would you stoke the fire, please. ( Marie does a roundabout heading for the hearth while Anne Marie finishes her conversation with the customers, and glances out a window near the fireplace. Seeing the twilight gathering, she then goes to the dimmer switch by the window and raises the lights in the alcove. This illuminates The Poet who is seated in a booth. He is above average in height and slender to medium in build and looks to be in his late twenties to early thirties. His complexion is sun—burnt, and he has curly short brown hair, brown eyes and a beard. Wearing dress jeans and a dark blue wool dress jacket, beneath which is a beige Hudson Bay blazer, he has dark brown wing tips and is sporting gold rim glasses. The Poet watches Anne Marie intently, apparently captivated by her. As she goes to exit, he leans forward. )   The Poet: ( amiably ) How ya doing? ( Anne Marie nods absentmindedly to The Poet and exits through the doorway as he sits back and sips his coffee reflectively. When Marie passes he leans forward to speak with her. ) The Poet: Excuse me, miss. That woman that just left, I’d like to give hersome poetry, is she married?   Marie: Who, Anne Marie?   The Poet: Damn, I didn’t want to know her name.   Marie: ( does a double take ) What? Uh, no. No, she’s not. ( gives him a cold but bewildered glance, then leaves. The Poet rises with a slight smile, leaving his coffee unfinished, and exits with a distant look on face. )   Scene 2   7 :45 PM. Opens on the Alice in Wonderland exhibit, Central Park, Manhattan. It is dusk in late August, and very humid, with dark clouds moving fast across the horizon. Center to the stage are the bronze statues, the largest of which is Alice sitting Indian-style on a giant mushroom, the Cheshire Cat crouching before her. The White Rabbit stands to the left, holding his pocket-watch up. On the right are the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Doormouse atop a smaller mushroom. A slight wind gently scatters bits of litter across the cement surrounding the statues. Enter The Pointless One stage right. Although he is average in height, his frame is large and muscular. Approximately sixty years old, he is a Negro of the darkest persuasion, with short gray-white hair, brown eyes, and an unshaven gray stubble. Dressed in a ragged blue flannel shirt and brown polyester pants which are heavily soiled and hang tattered down to his bare feet, he is toothless, and is sporting a bottle of Thunderbird. Babbling as he walks, he moves to center stage shuffling his feet, coming to rest directly in front of the Mad Hatter.   The Pointless One: I’m alright now! All I needed was a couple of days to mourn the passing away of my soul! ( throws his head back and laughs idiotically, with great exaggeration slaps his knee ) I’ve reorientated, ( turns to stare White Rabbit statue in the face ) focusing in on the physical-material aspects, and have thrown that useless energy of emotion to the ground. ( spits at rabbit’s feet in gesture, looks up to Alice, then back to rabbit ) You know… that spontaneous rose or poem, when I would rather have died then to be rejected,( sobs loudly with one hand covering his eyes as if to hide his tears ) when fire burned in my heart, and I would look away to hide the passion… ( stares blankly to the right stage for a moment, then turns puppy-eyed to the Cheshire Cat ) or maybe you never noticed? No matter! ( hobbles in a circle then comes back to lean a hip on the Doormouse’s mushroom ) Y’know, today I bought an oil company. Yea-ah! ( overly emphasized ) I was lounging around in my cardboard sidewalk palace, contemplating all the luxurious things I own, ( mumbles sarcastically ) my box, these hard luck shoes, ( holds his foot up so the rabbit can see his bare foot ) my shorts, ( pulls a yellowed edge to his shorts through a rip in his pants ) my shirt. ( pats his chest with both hands repeatedly, like a gorilla ) I decided a fortune still awaited me in the oil industry, so-o-o, I played my trump card( produces a bunch of Monopoly cards and red plastic hotels from his shirt pocket and throws them over his shoulder towards the bushes ) and I won Boardwalk!!! ( with a wave of his hand holds out the Boardwalk card between his two fingers and then slides it in his right back pocket ) After all, isn’t life an extra-large game of Monopoly? ( moves from side to side, staring the rabbit in the face, then turns smiling to Alice ) Gotta dollar?- my cash flow is short, ( holds out hand at waist-level indicating short ) and I need my medicine. ( spins the cap off of the bottle, downing it with a big swig, then throws it empty into the bushes ) Ya know how it is, don’t ya? ( addressed at the walkway as if someone was approaching ) Oh Jesus, I almost forgot! ( to all ) My dog Peuter got a go-directly-to-jail card, and I haf’ta go bail him out. He’s a real pain in the ass, but he gives great stock market tips. ( to the cat ) Gotta run! ( bows like a prince to Alice, then bows to the rest with great flourish ) Now where’d I park that limo, ( turns both ways ) or did I have the jet today? ( sounds of feet on the pathway come from right stage. Hearing this The Pointless One exits quickly left stage. Enter Leslie Blackwater and Ketcham Collean Orelse right stage. Leslie, who is on the tall side for a woman, has a voluptuous hourglass figure. In her early thirties, she has wavy auburn hair cut slightly below the ears, soft features and soft blue eyes with a light and freckled complexion. She is wearing a two-piece gray women’s business suit with a white shirt fringed around the collar and gray pumps with big silver buckles. Ketcham, who is about five foot six, and just over a hundred pounds, is in her early twenties. With a rosy white complexion and long flowing black hair, she has sharp attractive features with piercing dark eyes. She is wearing a black oriental robe/dress that ends just below the knees, which is low-cut but with a closed collar, and black ballet type slippers. Ketcham saunters to center stage while Leslie follows reluctantly.)   Leslie: (with a noticeable Southern accent) Listen, Ketch, don’t you think we should be going? It’s getting dark and it looks like it’s going to pour.   Ketcham: (with a light Irish accent) Come on, Leslie, I haven’t felt a breeze all day, and now that it’s getting nice, you want to leave and spend an hour and a half on a hot smelly train. Relax a minute and rest your feet. (leans her back against the White Rabbit)   Leslie: (pacing anxiously) I know- I’m sorry, but I want to get home and check my answering machine to see if Richard got back from Chicago yet. I miss him!   Ketcham: (disgustedly) I don’t understand why you let your life revolve around him, he’s a slob when it comes down to it… besides, you can do better. (a spotlight illuminates The Poet who has been hidden in the shadows left stage. He is wearing a Pink Puppy RCA t-shirt, torn blue jeans with grease stains, and grimy old work boots which are half-laced. Writing furiously on a brown paper bag, he occasionally glances at the two.) Ketcham: (nods towards The Poet) Take him for instance! He might be interesting. You need some new blood in your life.   Leslie: (repulsed, she whispers harshly) What are you crazy- He’s probably a maniac or something! Look at his eyes- they’re creepy! He’s dressed like a bum, I’ll bet he lives here. Oh shit, he’s coming towards us! (she fidgets nervously as The Poet moves slowly across the clearing with one hand concealed behind his back. Path lights go on in the background.)  Ketcham: (to Leslie in regards to her fidgeting) Cut it out! He’ll think you’re nervous!   The Poet: (timidly stepping up as Ketcham moves to her feet) Excuse me, ladies- I wrote you each a poem. I’d be honored if you’d accept them. ( Ketcham and Leslie turn to each other somewhat baffled as The Poet extends the poetry. Hesitantly, Ketcham accepts first, then Leslie does as well.) The Poet: (encouraged by their acceptance) I’d also like to present you with these, (stepping back, he hands each a red rose, which were what he had hidden in his left hand.) as it is a custom in my profession to give flowers with poetry.   Ketcham: ( regarding him indifferently as Leslie moves behind her fearfully ) Thanks, should we read them now?   The Poet: ( stares Ketcham in the eyes lovingly ) Please wait until I leave, I’m real shy and would surely become embarrassed. ( moves away dejectedly ) Thanks a lot, have a nice night, ladies. ( disappears behind bush )   Leslie: ( stepping forward bravely to face Ketcham ) Was that weird or what? The way he looked, I thought he was going to rob us or something.   Ketcham:  (she unfolds the pager bag and reads the poem once silently, and then aloud) Check it out. It’s called-Deja Vu   Where have you seen me, on TV, just in the air Like a billion other people, on the streets, I’m everywhere In a car, a truck that’s passing, on a bench, inside the park Down a long and lonely alley, by a light post in the dark Was it early in the morning, I came jogging past your house Or on vacation in Europe, I’m the one with the pet mouse Was I cranking on a trumpet, or just banging on a drum Had an accident with you once, you were calling me a scum Where you work I wash the windows, and at home deliver mail I was lying on a sidewalk, close to death, my face was pale I have heard you in confession, and have mugged you for a joy Shot your brother or your neighbor, gave your children Christmas toys I went off on the space shuttle, time to conquer a new world Trying hard to hypnotize you, my gold watch, you watched, it twirled I was captain on a steamer, and the president of France Dropped a bomb on Hiroshima, at the disco saw you dance I had served you chocolate pudding, the dry cleaner with your clothes I am standing here beside you, sold you tickets at the show I was there when you were married, came of age, I helped you vote Gave you money on your birthday, own the mansion with the moat I ‘m a leper, bum, a wino, the old lady with the bags Made that fancy quilted blanket, cried to you when I was sad I was lost in snowy mountains with no chance of me to find I was locked inside a padded room, having cut loose of my mind I’m the guy you thought you once loved, but it proved of no avail I’m the soul left broken-hearted  feeling shocked on the third rail...   ( pauses to catch her breath and leans back on the mushroom )   Deja Vu means having seen something before, in French, doesn’t it? You know, like a premonition.   Leslie: (addressed to where The Poet disappeared ) That guy is strange. Here, read mine. ( hands over paper bag )   Ketcham: ( takes the poem and reads it aloud )   Inept...   The heart that pumps an ice cold bloodwas tempered deep in hell So putrid is its purposeas eyes with tears they swell Unwanted and unwanting unable and unknown The soul, it shrinks in uselessness And mind is wasted ….blown.   (hands the poem back to Leslie)   Leslie: (holding the poem cautiously) They both sound suicidal to me. What’s his problem?   Ketcham: (slightly annoyed) I think they’re sad, you can see it in his eyes. It’s like he’s hiding a lot of pain.   Leslie:(sarcastically) He’s not in pain, he’s insane. We’re lucky he didn’t kill us or something. ( looks at the rose in her hand) He probably put poison on the thorns, or acid on the paper. (throws the rose and the poem to the ground ) Come on, let’s go now! (she grabs Ketcham by the hand as Ketcham glances down at the rose and poem and is led away. The Poet slowly walks back on stage and picks up his spurned gifts, one in each hand.)   The Poet: (soberly) If you only knew the pains of hope, (a tear rolls down his cheek as he raises the rose in his clenched hand before him and squeezes it until blood trickles down his wrist, and then throws it violently away ) if only you knew....   Scene 3   9:00 PM. Opens aboard a Long Island Railroad train.Leslie and Ketcham are in a coach that is in rundown condition, on their way to Leslie’s apartment. Graffiti mars the seats, walls, and advertisements. Leslie and Ketcham are seated in the middle of the car on the right side. To the left rear are eight Hispanic-looking teenage boys and one mullato girl. Three of the boys are standing, goofing around loudly with each other, while the girl is ignoring her companions and drawing a “Kilroy was here” doodle on the window in black marker. Towards the front are two businessmen and an old couple who appear oblivious to the rowdiness behind them.   Ketcham: ( twirls the rose in her hand ) I like his poem, it says a lot— kinda like the ones Walter used to give me. I wish he had signed his name.   Leslie: ( sneers down her nose at Ketcham ) Will you forget about him He’s probably out raping someone as we speak. And he was a whole different kind of crazy.   Ketcham: ( gazes out window briefly ) Give me a break, Les.. Why do you always have to be so negative about everything.( exasperated, she mocks Leslie’s sneer ) I’m sure he’s a really nice guy— just a little mysterious.   Leslie: ( angered by Ketcham’s exaggerated expression ) Nice guy- huh… Well, he can finish last as far as I’m concerned.   Ketcham: ( loudly ) God! You can be such a bitch sometimes! ( just then a strung-out hippie type in fatigues walks towards the rear of car carrying a poster of the ad “This is your brain on drugs”. He approaches the two women and holds up the sign. )   Hippie: ( in a Halcion daze ) Hey, babes, ya wanna make a donation to the war on drugs?   Leslie: ( antagonistically ) No! On which side are you? ( the hippie shrugs and exits through the rear of the car. Leslie stares down the aisle angrily as Ketcham settles back with a frustrated sigh. )   Scene 4   10:00 PM. Opens on the shoulder of the Long Island Expressway. It is not raining now but puddles line the shoulder of the roadway from a previous downpour. Marvelous Marvin is trying to break the lug nuts free on the front left tire of a Mazda pickup truck. At a mere five foot five, he does not have a muscular build for a man in his late twenties. With a dark tan complexion and short straight blond hair, he has peculiarly shamrock green eyes. Dressed in a navy blue three-piece pinstripe suit, he has a lime green shirt, a forest green tie, and black dress shoes with green and blue argyle socks. Richland Logico is sitting in the passenger seat of the truck with his eyes closed and head back, feigning sleep. Also in his late twenties, he is close to six feet in height and chubby. His complexion is light, aside from a bright red nose which is somewhat flattened. His hair, short and brown with a large bald spot, and a reddish beard contrasts his gray-green eyes. We can see he is dressed in a yellow and white polo shirt. As the lug wrench slips, Marv falls off balance onto his posterior with a splash.   Marv: ( grabbing the wrench and leaping to his feet, he raises it above his head. ) You mutha! ( angrily throws the wrench down which rebounds into his shin. He grabs his leg and hops on one foot ) Shit! Shit! Shiiit! ( it starts to drizzle ) Richland: ( rolls down his window and asks coyly ) Are you going to be able to fix it, or shall we find a phone and call a taxi?   Marv: No way I’m gonna leave my truck on the side of the Expressway! ( a car speeds by, horn blaring, and douses Marv with a sheet of water. Enraged, he yells after the car ) Muthafuckah, I’ll kick your goddamn ass! ( turns back wiping face futilely with sleeve ) Son of a bitch! ( shaking his head amused, Richland rolls the window up and leans back again. Marv, hearing the roar of a large vehicle approaching, starts to jump up and down waving his arms. A 1951 Jaguar Mark IX skids to a halt in front of the Mazda. It is two-tone, John Deere green over forest green, and stands over eight feet high on all wheel drive. With dual tires in the rear, the chrome running boards have small white lights that face up illuminating the body of the car. Dim green lights highlight the custom license plate, which reads “UNIQUE I”. The Poet jumps out. )   The Poet: ( nearing Marv ) Need a hand?!   Marv: ( resignedly ) Yeah, I’d appreciate it. I got a flat and can’t break the nuts loose.   The Poet: ( bending over to inspect the tire, he yanks a nail from a tread ) Here’s your problem, you picked up a nail. ( holds it up to show Marv, then tosses it with disregard into the bushes ) I’ve got just the thing to fix it though. ( returns to the Jaguar and opens it’s trunk. He digs for a moment, then pulls out an air hose and a small wooden box and returns to the Mazda trailing the hose ) Camel patches! ( holds open the box to Marv ) They work great, especially if you’re four wheeling someplace where no one can tow you, even if they could find you! ( plugs in a patch where the nail was, then fills the tire with air and checks for leaks with puddle water. Marv approaches the Jaguar as The Poet coils the air hose and puts it and the box away. )   Marv: ( astonished ) That’s amazing! You even have an air compressor in there! This car is fantastic. Where did you get it? You build it yourself?   The Poet: ( closes the trunk and caresses the car lovingly ) Sure did! It took three and a half years, and lots of energy, but I finally did it. This is my prototype for ‘Toys For The Rich, Unlimited’, a business venture of mine. ( he moves around the car to the driver’s door and opens it. Marv follows him and peers inside. )   Marv: ( impressed ) Wow, this is really great! ( then speaks hesitantly ) Oh, uh- can I offer you anything for helping me? Ur,I’m Marv by the way, ( holds out his hand to be shaken )   The Poet: ( shakes Marv’s hand while holding the other out, palm up ) That’ll be seventy five dollars for roadside service if you please. ( Marv’s jaw drops as he pulls his hand back in shock ) Relax, I’m only kidding! Actually, I enjoy playing the Good Samaritan. Strangers shouldn’t be afraid to help out one another, don’t you think. Considering we all share the same planet, how can we truly be strangers?... ( he climbs into the Jag and starts the engine, staring out the windshield ) Anyway... I don’t know.... ( shakes his head and looks down to Marv ) Hey, do you like to read by the way?   Marv: ( shrugs ) Ur,yeah,sure.. Why?   The Poet: ( reaches into the glove box, pulls out a poem and hands it to Marv ) A little gift from a maniac. I gotta go! Have a nice night, and remember, they’re called camel patches. ( revs the motor nurturingly ) Take it easy! ( closes his door and drives off, giving a short toot on his air horns )   Marv: ( faintly ) Bye. ( opens the poem and reads the first line in an odd tone ) You’re one eye ( his recitation is overshadowed by The Poet’s voice-over ) and I’m the other We share of the same brain but still we can’t agree upon the objects at which we strain For I see close and you see far instead of eye to eye And what becomes of all this mess is enough to make me cry...   Scene 5   11:15 PM. Opens in Leslie’s bedroom. Central is a large bed with a pink satin coverlet and a white lace canopy above it. The walls are painted a creamy white and soft lighting is provided by a Miss Piggy lamp on a bedside table to the left on the back wall. To the right rear, a rack stereo system and a collection of cassettes and CD’s climb to the ceiling on white-painted shelves. Next to that, on the right wall, is a pink enamel vanity with a large mirror surrounded by unlit rose-shaded bulbs, and a white padded stool . A princess telephone with an answering machine rests on top of the vanity amid a litter of various cosmetic bottles. Right forefront is a plain white door with a Southern Comfort calendar hanging on it.. Dominating the left wall is a life-size photo-poster of Richland hung on a closet door, next to which is a pink enamel bureau. The room has numerous dolls arranged around, the largest of which is a three foot Raggedy Ann sitting against the bed’s headboard. Turning on the mirror lights, Leslie stands before the vanity, primping. Ketcham lies across the bed on her left side, with her head supported by one hand, the other holding the poem “Deja Vu” before her and the rose is on the bed in front of her. Leslie reaches down to play back the answering machine, then continues primping.   Richland:( voice-over from answering machine ) Hi, hon! I’m back from the Windy City. Listen, I spoke with George and he told me there’s going to be a Viking funeral for Walter at the Cold Spring Basin. Something about a last request that we should all be together. ( chuckles ) They’re going to sail his ashes into eternity. That’s Walter for you! Anyway, it starts at midnight. We have to leave from Club Mud. Marvin is going to drive me, so will you meet me there? Luv’ya, bye.   Leslie: ( shutting off machine ) A Viking funeral? I thought he was an American. ( laughs vicariously )   Ketcham: ( rolls onto her stomach ) Leslie, do you know how Walter died? No one seems to know. Walter’s brother, George, won’t even tell me. ( pushes the poem away from her )   Leslie: ( sits down and adjusts her make-up ) Well, I can’t say I know anything for sure, but I think Walter had been depressed ever since the two of you broke up.   Ketcham: ( bolting to her feet she knocks the rose to the floor ) Oh, come on, that was years ago! ( she bends to pick up the rose ) Wait a minute! ( flinches and pulls a thorn from her fingertip ) You don’t mean he...? ( droppping the thorn in a small garbage pail beneath the bedside table, she sucks blood from her finger )   Leslie: ( continuing to primp, she eyes Ketcham’s reaction in the mirror ) Like I said, I don’t know anything, But Walter as never the same since then. Three years, and he never got over it.   Ketcham: ( defensively ) I never went out with him! We were just friends. I told him that! Besides, I can’t be held responsible for whatever he may have done.   Leslie: Cut it out, Ketch. Face it, Walter weirded out, he stopped hanging around with everyone at Club Mud, and when he was there, he was always quiet and withdrawn. I swear the guy never laughed anymore.   Ketcham: ( exclamatory, nearing anger ) He was obsessed with me! I had to get away from him! He even proposed to me when we met in France, and I’d only known him a couple of days. That’s why I moved to the city, and he still tried to find me. He’d leave flowers under my windshield wiper whenever I’d visit my parents, he’d send me poetry like this. ( she picks up “Deja Vu”, waves it in the air, then throws it down onto the foot of the bed )   Leslie: ( checking the time on her watch, she stands hurriedly ) I don’t want to talk about this anymore. I’m already late to meet Richland. I have to leave.( turns off the vanity lights and moves towards door, speaking over her shoulder ) Care to come along? Walter held a torch for you in life, maybe you can hold it for him in death.   Ketcham: ( with a sour face ) Real funny! ( calming down somewhat ) I might as well! I haven’t seen anyone from Club Mud in a while.   Leslie: ( walks to the closet and takes out a black trench coat ) Do you want to borrow a raincoat? It’s wet out.   Ketcham: ( moves towards her ) Sure. ( Leslie gives the coat to Ketcham ) Thanks... Did Rich say Marvelous Marv was going to be there?   Leslie: ( pulling a gray raincoat out for herself ) Probably, he’s driving Richland there. Why?   Ketcham: ( as they leave ) I never could stand that geek.   Scene 6  12:15 AM. Opens on Club Mud marina, Huntington, Long Island. The rain has stopped, but wind gusts cause masts to ping in the background. Laid out in a large T, the main dock has fingers extending for each pair of boats. For the most part, the boats are weathered wooden wrecks, but an occasional fiberglass speedboat stands out amid these sore thumbs. Pagoda lights line the sagging and twisted docks. On the main dock, which runs across the stage, Richland and Marv sit on coolers drinking Heineken from cans. We can now see Richland is wearing dirty white baker’s pants and old leather thong sandals, as well as the polo shirt. Behind them is a large black and tan barge that has been converted to a houseboat with camouflage colored sails. From up in the hills, off to the right, a woman is practicing an aria with unnerving ability. Occasional low laughter from the various dock residents can also be heard.   Richland: ( in a sullen tone ) Women ( crushes his can reflexively ) Can’t live with’em, can’t shoot them when you’re done. ( he throws the empty can into the water in front of him, making a faint splash, then reaches into his cooler and gets another beer )   Marv: ( amused ) Sexist pig! ( snickering, he raises his can in cheers ) I like it! ( they both drink as Richland peers down the dock to the right )   Richland: ( indignantly ) Where the hell is she?!   Marv: ( conciliatory ) Do you want to try calling her again?   Richland ( petulantly ) I’m not going to waste another quarter! I spend too much on her as it is! Half my life I’ve been waiting on her. She’s got five more minutes, then we’re leavin’ without her. ( enter The Poet stage right, striding hurriedly. )   Marv: ( surprised to see The Poet, he stands quickly ) Hey, check out who it is, it’s the poet, the guy with the monster Jag!   The Poet: ( stopping, he shakes Marv’s hand, and looks to Richland who doesn’t react ) The Poet— now that has a nice ring to it! ( chuckles ) What are you guys doing here?   Marv: ( boasts ) We’re going to a Viking funeral at the Sand Hole, you know, the Cold Spring Basin. ( nods in Richland’s direction ) Just waiting for his girlfriend. ( the sounds of women approaching can be heard from stage right )   The Poet: ( casts his eyes rightward, then quickly back to Marv ) I’m looking for Myron the dock master. Do you know where his boat is?   Richland: ( waves vaguely left stage ) Straight down the main dock, make a right at the end, Myron’s is the last boat on the left, the Black Cloud.   The Poet: ( amicably ) Thanks, take it easy. ( moves down the dock, exiting stage left as Leslie and Ketcham enter stage right )   Marv: ( excitedly ) Hey, Rich, here she is. Who’s that with her?   Richland: ( recognizing Ketcham ) Holy shit( jumps up ) blast from the past! Oh, what a Ketch! ( steps forward to give Ketcham a big hug and a kiss, then holding her at arm’s length he eyes her leeringly up and down ) Damn, you’re looking good! How long has it been anyway?   Ketcham: ( stepping back, she shakes her head ) Not long enough.   Marv: ( sheepishly ) Same old Ketch, um... how’s city life?   Leslie: ( insinuates herself under Richland’s arm, holding him possessively) Where’s my hello?   Richland: ( pecks her on the cheek ) Hi, hon. You’re late. What took you so long?   Ketcham: ( apologetically ) It was my fault. I got out of work late, so we missed the early train.   Leslie: ( examines the area ) Where is everyone? Are we the only ones who came?   Richland: ( obsequiously ) No, most everyone already went to the Sand Hole, but Myron left me the keys to the launch because we had to wait for you.   Marv: ( anxiously ) We should get going!   Richland ( grabs Leslie’s arm gently and glances at her watch ) Yeah, you’re right. Let’s go. Leslie, grab an end of this. ( Richland and Leslie pick up one cooler, exiting stage left as Marv grabs one handle of the second cooler and looks expectantly towards Ketcham. She returns his look, crosses her arms, and exits stage left, leaving Marv standing alone appearing dumbfounded. )   Scene 7   1:00 AM. Opens on Long Island Sound. The wind has picked up drastically, causing white caps to break over the gunnels of a whale-bellied World’s Fair launch, within which are Richland, Leslie, Marv and Ketcham. Richland is at the helm when the motor is heard to sputter and stall. Cursing and gesticulating, Richland attempts to restart the motor without success. The others start to bail the swamping boat as it rocks furiously. All have to shout to be heard over the howling wind.   Richland: ( slams his fist onto the console and yells ) Alamatta Pingga!!! Twice in a day breaking down! This is too much. Let’s try to paddle our way to shore. ( All start to paddle with various boat accoutrements, but no one seems to know which direction to go. Stopping, they appear confused and search around)   Ketcham: ( points to port side ) Over there! Is that land? I see a light!   Marv: ( all-knowingly ) No! That’s a buoy. It’s blinking. Land should be that way. ( points to starboard as the launch grinds to a halt in the sand. Marv falls face first into Ketcham’s chest, tumbles over, and spills the cooler onto Leslie’s feet. Marv scrambles up quickly, bumping into Richland and almost knocking him overboard. ) Oh, shit! I’m sorry!   Ketcham: ( scornfully ) Tell me I’m wrong! ( moves to the bow away from Marv ) Get lost!   Richland: ( helping Leslie to replace the cans into the cooler ) ASSHOLE!   Leslie: ( shaking off her feet ) He is! ( Ketcham removes her slippers and slides off the bow to find herself standing on a beach with waves crashing over her feet. Taking the anchor from the forward deck, she plants it firmly in the sand above the tide line)   Richland: ( commandingly ) Let’s go see what that light is. ( moves to the bow ) Leslie: ( whiningly ) Do you think we should? It’s private property, isn’t it?   Marv: ( opens a beer and gulps from it repeatedly ) Would you rather stay out here all night?! ( jumping over the port gunnel, he lands waist deep in water, then splashes to the shore )   Leslie: ( assesses the situation ) I guess not. ( moves to the bow and gets out aided by Richland. All exit stage left as the rain again begins to fall )   Scene 8   1:30 AM. Opens in front of L’Abbaye de Flavigny, which is on a hill overlooking the Long Island Sound. The rain continues as lightning silhouettes the monolithic structure. A stone stairway center stage leads to large arched wooden doors. To the right of the stair’ are windows through one of which can be seen the blue flickering light of a television. The rest of the building is shrouded in darkness. Richland, Leslie, Marv and Ketcham enter stage right.   Richland: ( peering up at the building as lightning flashes ) Kinda eerie, hunh? ( the group stops at the foot of the stairs hesitantly, then Ketcham steps forward and climbs the stairs to knock on the door firmly. Protectively Richland sprints up the steps and gently pulls Ketcham aside as floodlights illuminate the face of a cut-stone three story building which is constructed in a peculiar architectural style with a red flat tile roof. The first and third floor windows are tall and wide with arched tops, while those on the second floor are small and oval. The Butler opens the right hand door and steps out. He is short, frail and aged with a greenish complexion, short white hair, and piercing blue eyes. Dressed in a black butler’s uniform with a red velvet liner to his vest, his shirt and gloves are a spotless white, contrasting his polished black shoes. )   The Butler: ( speaks with a paused deliberateness, but politely ) May I help you?   Ketcham: ( stepping forward again ) Excuse me, sir, we’re sorry to bother you so late but our boat broke down on your beach, and we saw your TV set.. ( points to the glow in the window ) We were hoping maybe we could use your telephone. We’d really appreciate it.   Marv: ( interjecting ) It would only be a local call.   The Butler: ( examines the group suspiciously ) The master is out at the moment, and doesn’t believe in phones. However, if you will follow me, I will gladly let you use my private phone. ( ushers all inside and closes the door )   Scene 9  1:40 AM. Opens on the same group standing in the parlour. To the right is a wide flight of cut interlocking stone stairs with no railings, climbing to a landing with large arched stained glass windows in the background. From here another flight of stone stairs rises to the foreground on the left side, above which is a tremendous cathedral ceiling. Beneath the left stairs, a hallway with many etched glass doors extends to rear stage and the courtyard beyond. The floor is checkered black-and-white marble and the walls are of a whitewashed cut stone. Eight suits of armour line each side of the room and there is a carved oak doorway on the right. The lighting is flaming torches set into the walls at strategic intervals. All four players look about astonished while The Butler waits for their attention patiently.   Richland: ( impassioned, he waves his arm indicating the decor ) Can you believe this place. This is the life!   Leslie: ( with shrill excitement ) I didn’t know anything like this existed on Long Island!   Ketcham: ( perplexed, she chews her fingernail in deep thought ) This place seems familiar. I could swear I’ve been here before. The layout is exactly like a monastery I visited in the middle of France, ( turns to the others ) where I met Walter.   The Butler: Flavigny sur Ozerain, perhaps? In Burgundy? This is the Abbey of Flavigny, it was moved stone by stone in 1987, and modified to be somewhat more luxurious than what the monks were accustomed to.   Ketcham: ( reminiscing with wondrous eyes ) My God! This is it! ( with pain in her voice ) This is where Walter proposed to me.   Marv and Richland: ( both astonished, speaking simultaneously ) Walter proposed to you?!   The Butler: ( breaks in with a quizzical expression on his face ) This way, if you please, to the phone. I hope you don’t mind the untidiness. ( The Butler leads the group through the carved oak door stage right )   Scene 10   The Butler’s bedroom is spacious with lofty ceilings. To the right foreground is a king-size bed with an elaborately carved headboard, behind which is a lacquered wooden chest of drawers with an ornamental brass lamp and an assortment of bottles and candles on top of it. Against the left wall, fore-front, is a set of shelves with a collection of animal skulls and fossils. The door leading to the parlour is between it and a large metal cabinet in the back left corner which is eight feet tall, four feet wide, painted a dark green, and covered with a variety of automotive stickers. Next to the cabinet, on the back wall, is a grey steel office desk with a green glass student lamp, a black electric typewriter, and a wide screen TV which is covered with static snow, the sound of which fills the room. On the walls are posters and mementoes from around the world. In the center of the back wall is a short wide bureau which matches the chest of drawers. Upon it stands a four foot tall plaster angel with bare feet and spread golden wings. She is clad in a pearlescent sky—blue robe, bound about the waist with a braided golden rope. In her right hand she holds a lit torchiere, in her left is a bottle of Perrier held close to her body with a blue and white bandanna draped over her forearm. She has wavy blond hair with green and yellow leis appearing to hold her hair back from her face. Her mystical blue eyes are made of glass and seem almost human. At her feet is the phone which the Butler gestures towards. As Richland picks it up and dials, the Butler turns off the television.   The Butler: ( stands with his arms behind his back ) The storm must have knocked out the cable. ( Richland speaks on the phone indistinguishably, while the others curiously observe the contents of the room )   Leslie: ( sits on the edge of the bed ) This is an, umm, interesting room.   Marv: ( poking the angel in the eye curiously ) Definitely! You must have done a lot of travelling?   The Butler: ( uncomfortably ) I did in my younger days, but now I only travel with the master.   Ketcham: ( approaches the Butler ) Who is the master anyway? What does he do for a living?   The Butler: ( resuming his calculated manner ) Out of respect for his privacy, I can not tell you his name; I will tell you he is a recluse and has no need to work for a living.   Richland: ( hangs up the phone and interrupts ) No one can come get us until tomorrow morning. Would it be alright if we slept in the boat on your beach?   The Butler: ( steps towards the door ) That is fine. I regret I can not invite you to stay here without the master’s permission. He prefers solitude, and has been quite moody of late. If, when he returns ( glancing at his watch, he opens the door ) he says it is acceptable, I will come find you and bring you up. Do you need blankets, or anything else?   Marv: ( nonchantly ) We’ll be okay. We’re really grateful for your help. It’s no problem sleeping on the boat.   The Butler: ( gestures to the exit ) Let me see you to the door.   Scene 11   3:00 AM.. Opens back at the launch which is sitting in the mud because the tide has gone partially out. The players busy themselves setting up camp. Richland pulls a canvas from a compartment in the stern of the launch, and spreads it out with the help of Marv over the bow, leaving one corner through which access may be had. Leslie tries to block the fierce wind from blowing out a small fire she and Ketcham have made, as the latter wanders in search of wood for the fire. Richland and Marv finish the shelter and lean against the side of the launch, watching the woman work.   Richland: ( condescendingly ) I don’t know why you two are making a fire, it won’t keep us dry in the boat. ( the rain starts to come down in buckets, causing the fire to sizzle out, as Ketcham drops an armful of wood to run to the shelter of the launch. All four climb in and pull the canvas shut behind them. Shortly thereafter Leslie is heard to moan... )   Leslie: We’ll be fine. No bother to sleep on the boat! What do you think we are... DUCKS!   Richland: ( grumpily ) I don’t know why I bothered to come, never liked Walter anyway. ( several moments pass, then headlights flash across the boat, and a rumble from a motor can be heard, when suddenly The Poet’s Jaguar floats airborne from over a dune, lands sideways, and slides to a stop about five feet away from the launch )   Richland: ( paws at the canvas trying to find an edge ) WHAT THE... ( he flips back the canvas exposing everyone within, who stand as The Poet opens his door and climbs down )   The Poet: ( pleasantly surprised ) There you people are, everyone at the Sand Hole was worried about you. What happened?   Marv: The damn boat broke down. Not my night I guess.   Ketcham: ( holds a boat cushion over her head to keep herself from getting wet ) Hey, I know you! You’re the poet, aren’t you? We met in the park today.   Leslie: ( moving behind Richland ) You’re right, it’s him! ( Richland and Marv share a mistrustful glance )   Richland: ( indignantly ) What is it with this guy, he’s everywhere I go today?   The Poet: ( offended ) What’s your problem, you’re on my beach, I live here! If you want to sleep somewhere warmer than under a wet canvas, you’d better learn some manners. If you’d rather, I’ll leave you to fend for yourself! ( Richland begins to respond hostilely, but is stopped when Ketcham gives him a sharp elbow to the stomach )   Ketcham: ( apologetically ) I’m sorry. We’d really appreciate your hospitality. It’s miserable out here.   The Poet: ( smiles at Ketcham ) Grab your stuff and hop in the back seat. ( he opens the back door and folds down a step which has been tucked beneath the running board) I’ll drive you up to the house.   Marv: ( seeming pleased ) Cool!!! ( they all gather their possessions, step from the launch and pile into the back seat of the Jaguar. The Poet pulls himself into the driver’s seat, starts the engine, and drives away aggressively leaving the launch unattended with the canvas hanging half off. )   Scene 12   3:45 AM. Opens in the dining room of the Abbey.Lengthwise to center stage is a table made of heavy oak timbers which is thirty feet long and nine feet wide. The room’s dimensions are a massive sixty by forty with a thirty foot ceiling which, from a central point directly over the table, arches in many different directions. From this point hangs a huge crystal chandelier with well over one hundred candles providing light for dining; placed strategically throughout the room are torches in floor stands. Two cow-roasting size fireplaces are at a full blaze, and are situated to either side of the ends of the table along the back wall; between them is a set of stained glass windows which are fifteen feet high by five feet wide. The window on the left depicts a blazing sun and a lone dead tree in a barren valley with vultures circling above. The window on the right depicts the same location, but with a golden quarter moon high over a meadow within which stands the silhouette of a healthy tree. The walls are panelled with intricately carved ebony. To the left is a doorway with etched glass doors in the open position; on the right is a bar with smoked mirrors lining the wall behind it. Shelves are mounted the face of each mirror, upon which are many different liquors. The bar is of the same material as the table, and has a line of beer taps on one end and a line of ice buckets on the other. Knick knacks are spread between them with a small crystal vase holding a single red rose in the center. Around the table are a number of heavy wooden chairs, but the one center stage, backside of the table, is closer to a throne than the rest and is twice as large. Of a polished white marble, the floors reflect the firelight. Enter The Poet and the players with two burly Irish wolfhounds, one white and the other silver, trailing them. The dogs stroll over to the left fireplace and lounge to bask in the heat as the players dry themselves with beach towels.   The Poet: ( motions for all to sit along the back edge of the table ) Please be seated. ( takes Ketcham by the hand and leads her to the throne-like chair ) You can be the queen! ( he seats her and plops down beside her on the right. Leslie sits immediately to the left of Ketcham, with Richland beside her and Marv takes the seat next to him. The Butler enters and collects the towels, then walks over to whisper something into The Poet’s ear. The Poet smiles at Ketcham, yet has a troubled expression on his face. Exit the Butler. )   Ketcham: ( examines the room, then The Poet ) So you must have known Walter, you did say you went to the funeral, didn’t you?   The Poet:Sure I knew Walter. This was his home until recently. Walter left me in charge of his estate on his deathbed!   Leslie and Ketcham: ( in unison turn to each other ) Walter’s!!!   Leslie: ( mind-boggled ) Walter never said anything about this house!   Richland ( accusingly ) C’mon, where would Walter have gotten money for a place this big?!   Marv: ( disbelievingly ) Walter worked doing demolition, he drove a ratty old car! Are you sure we’re talking about the same person? ( the white wolfhound rises and lollops over to The Poet and forces it’s head beneath his right hand, demanding attention )   The Poet: ( scratching the hound’s ear ) Walter De Zorzi, right? He was a very unique person if you got to know him, then again, none of you ever took the time, did you? Walter was a much different person then he may have led you to believe. ( firmly pushes the dog away and rests his folded hands on the table ) He was always rich, ever since his parents died when he was eight and left him half of the De Zorzi oil fortune. He never told people that because it would have affected how people treated him. Walter wanted to be loved for who he was, not for his money.   Ketcham: ( reaches out and latches onto the dog’s collar, pulling it near and scratching it’s chest as it sits ) I don’t understand all this, why would Walter have thought it could possibly make a difference to us? We were his friends, weren’t we? ( pauses briefly from complying with the hound’s demands ) And what about the old boat, the “Sans Souci”, I thought he lived there?   The Poet:The “Sans Souci” was mine until it sank, he just borrowed it so you wouldn’t know the truth about where he lived. That boat was in my family for over thirty years.... ( shaking his head, he leans forward to speak to the others ) You all may have known Walter in one way or another, but I’ll bet none of you knew when was his birthday, what his favourite color was, or how he felt about life. I probably know more about each of you, and I’m what you might call a perfect stranger, than what all of you combined really knew about Walter. Take you for instance, ( leans further over to see Richland eye-to-eye ) you always treated Walter like a God-damned idiot, never having a nice thing to say, doing things to hurt him behind his back. Did you really think you were so much smarter...did you think he didn’t see?   Richland: ( stands with clenched fists ) What in the hell do you know! ( the silver hound leaps to its feet and growls menacingly at Richland as Marv pulls him quickly back into his chair )   The Poet: ( confronts Leslie ) And you! You would have killed Walter rather than to let the truth come out about the night you seduced him on the Black Cloud. Do you have any idea how much that hurt him, and helped to further isolate him? You took from him his pride. You and your stupid sheep jokes. ( Leslie sobs and cries as Richland gives her a disgusted glare )   Marv: ( realizes he is next ) I never did a thing to him, so don’t blame me!   The Poet: ( vehemently ) You never did a thing! Walter trusted you with his friendship, and you betrayed him and ignored him. You were the only person that Walter even considered telling the truth to regarding his wealth. ( Marv starts to protest but is cut short by Ketcham )   Ketcham:I already know how I hurt Walter, you don’t have to get into it!   The Poet: ( changing to a sweeter disposition ) To the contrary, you’re the only hope Walter ever found in life. You gave him something to dream of, to believe in. Walter never stopped loving you, not even on his deathbed. ( enter the Butler )   The Butler: ( bows subserviently ) Dinner is ready, sir. Shall I have it brought in?   The Poet: ( searches his guests’ faces ) If no one objects? ( nods yes to the Butler who then exits )   Ketcham: ( placing a hand on The Poet’s elbow ) Would you mind telling me what Walter died of?   The Poet: ( putting his hand on hers ) It’s simple. Ironic though it may seem, Walter died from the strain and pain of hope. He no longer could bear living in what he knew was a lie, so he just gave up! ( the white dog shoves between them, separating their hands and resting it’s noble head on the table)   Ketcham: ( patting the dog ) Are you saying he just willed himself to death- I don’t believe it’s possible. ( enter the Butler followed by six servants with platters filled with food, dishes and various other things. The Butler oversees as the servants set the table with silverware, napkins, flowers, assorted dishes, wines, and water. Three servants exit, the remaining three, who are female, take positions behind Ketcham, as the Butler serves soup. The Poet abstains with a wave of his hand.)   Richland: ( shoving his soup away, he declares ) If Walter felt that way towards us, why did he even bother to hang around Club Mud? What, was he a glutton for punishment? ( The Poet signals over the Butler and whispers briefly into his ear. As the Butler exits, The Poet directs his attention to Richland. )   The Poet: ( trying to maintain his composure ) Do you have any idea what it’s like to have no friends, and almost no family? Walter was happy even to be abused by you, at least it was an acknowledgement that he was alive!!   Marv: ( sloppily spooning his soup ) Hey, if Walter was such a loser that he couldn’t make friends, why should any one of us be responsible for that?   The Poet: ( emotionally ) You think he didn’t try to make friends? Walter was no loser, you people are the losers! You couldn’t see beyond money and fame, that the only thing that really counts in life is love. Walter knew, he never forgot it! ( enter four servants with the second course. They serve the food, clear the soup dishes, then leave.) You may think it was just bad luck that brought us all together tonight, but you’re wrong. The boat breaking down and your landing here was pure coincidence, as was our meeting on the expressway, but I must confess, Ketcham, I followed you to the park. I wanted to try to justify Walter’s obsession with you. The Viking funeral is where Walter wanted his will to be read... and all of you are in his will! ( the Butler enters with the will in hand ) Richland: ( incredulously ) Why would he leave anything to us? We all treated him like shit, didn’t we?   The Poet: ( taking the will from the Butler ) Not all of you. ( looks to Ketcham ) Yet Walter didn’t, unlike me, hold it against you anyway. He never expected any of you to be more than human, and if you really knew Walter, you would know he loved all mankind despite those obvious flaws you seem to be such good examples of.   Richland: ( standing up angrily, he sits quickly at the prompting of the both wolfhounds, who move over to sit behind his chair ) What the heck makes you so good that you can put us down like this!   The Poet: ( reddening in the face ) Nothing makes me any better or worse. I at least am willing to admit my flaws, and I, like Walter, have tried to do something about it....   Marv: ( demandingly ) Well, what have you done?   Leslie: ( peevishly ) Yeah! So far all you are is a troublemaker and a big mouth! ( gulps down a big glass of wine which one of the servants behind Ketcham immediately refills )   The Poet: ( skims over the first few pages of the will briefly ) As to what I have tried to do about it, I have written poetry to tens of thousands of people just like all of you. Maybe no one ever understood what I was trying to communicate, how truly important love really is, yet at the very least I have tried. Can any of you make such a claim?( all try to avoid The Poet’s eyes as he gazes into each one’s face. The next course is brought in and served, then The Poet makes a motion with his hand and all servants as well as the Butler exit. The Poet begins to read from the will. )   And to Miss Leslie Blackwater, I leave my country estates in France, along with all incomes produced by said properties. To Mr. Richland Logico, I leave Castle No-Surrender in Castleiney, Ireland. To Mr. Marvelous Marvin, I leave my collection of vintage cars, housed on my brother’s estate in the Florida Keys, along with a lifetime yearly income of two hundred thousand dollars. ( pauses then continues in a softer voice ) And to Ms.. Ketcham Colleen Orelse, I leave the remainder of my assets, valued at one billion, two hundred and seventy eight thousand dollars on the one condition that she accept from my dearest friend, and the executor of my estate, the full collection of poetry, written to her and on which he has labored so hard. I also wish to apologize to her for not actually having been the author of the poems she has received throughout the years. ( The Poet puts down the will and waits for a response to what he has just read )   Ketcham: ( confused ) You mean it was you all these years who wrote the poems?   Marv: ( jumping around ecstatically ) I’m rich, I can’t believe it, I’m RICH!   Leslie: ( tears pour down her cheeks as she wipes her eyes and leans back dreamily in her seat )In France. I always wanted to go to France, how could this possibly be...   Richland: ( walks bravely over to The Poet and snatches the will from the table, flipping through the pages furiously ) There’s got to be some sort of a catch! What is this, a joke?! And what do you get from all this?   The Poet: ( smugly ) Aside from the satisfaction of watching you act like animals- nothing- nor do I want anything!   Ketcham: ( raises eyes to heaven as if talking to God ) Oh Walter, it didn’t have to be this way.... ( The Poet rises, walks over behind the bar, produces a leather bound book of poetry, and snatches the rose from the vase, both of which he then hands to Ketcham )   The Poet:It couldn’t have been any other way, nor can for me it be any other way. You deserve what Walter gave you! ( takes Ketcham’s hand and kisses it lightly ) I, like Walter, believe in love, In its power and its pains, and like Walter, love for me is only from afar. All those years of writing poems to that ultimate love in my imagination, and finally here you are… a goddess, a devil. My hope, yet hope can only exist in dreams, for a dream come true is suddenly no more than a reality. ( a single tear glides down his cheek, exit The Poet, followed by both dogs )   Scene 13   Opens on the Alice-in-Wonderland exhibit in the dead of night. There is a full moon shining brightly in the background, yet the statues’ surroundings are shrouded in a hazy darkness. The Pointless One, unchanged, stands facing Alice.   The Pointless One: ( with great sorrow ) What I would like from you... ( The Poet’s voice joins in simultaneously ) is the chance to hear you sing And the time to make you smile simple, basic types of things To stand laughing in the rain watch the rainbow when it ends Hold your hand beneath the moon share the special love of friends Talk of life and what it means how we two can make it last What is new and every day capture memories of the past Touch the fiber of your heart knowing there I have a place That your ear will always hear not in shame tomorrow face To be able to express without fear of you so dear Just how strong I truly care in my arms I want you near With a purpose to exist me for you and you for me Where we both can grow in joy This too much to ask for free...   ( turning to the audience with a tear in his eye, The Pointless One pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots himself in the heart, dropping to the ground. )   Scene 14   Opens outside the closed entrance gates to the Abbey; it is a crisp winter day. The twin gates are fifteen feet high and made of iron bars painted green. To either side, supporting them, are twelve foot gray granite pillars topped with green marble griffins. Bordering the road in the foreground are ten foot red brick walls extending from the pillars. Through the gates can be seen a blue stone driveway stretching a quarter-mile back to the Abbey which is framed by a clear sky. The driveway is edged in cobblestones and the gardens to either side are blanketed with snow. Between the pillars and the road is a wide cement apron. Mounted on the pillar to the right is an ornamental brass letter box. On the shoulder of the road to the left, The Poet’s Jaguar is parked with the motor running. To the rear of the Jag stands The Poet dressed in work boots, blue jeans and a white T-shirt with a caricature of a blue-green Earth, below which in large black letters is printed “Don’t Blow It”. The Poet paces with his arms crossed and shoulders hunched against the cold wind, and a cigarette dangles from his lips. Enter the Butler, dressed in “uniform” with a Navy-blue topcoat, gray rubber boots, and a gray fur Homburg. The Butler opens the right gate, sees The Poet and moves towards him with an expression of paternal concern.   The Butler: ( with uncharacteristic warmth ) Good morning, sir, how was your night?   The Poet: ( removes the cigarette from his mouth ) Laboured... not much time for sleep. You know me. ( glides to the driver’s door as the Butler follows) How’bout you? ( opening the door, he takes a manila folder from the front seat )   The Butler: ( scratches himself behind the ear ) Miss Ketcham was up late.   The Poet :( takes a last draw from his cigarette then flicks it away ) How did she react to “Yesterdays”?   The Butler: ( adjusts coat against the cold ) As she always has. Not being able to respond troubles her deeply. If I may, I’ve always felt the best way to resolve a dilemma is to face it. ( pauses thoughtfully, then speaks in a guarded tone ) I think the time has come for you to speak with her. It has been over two years.   The Poet: ( kicking slush from beneath his feet, he makes a spot to stand in ) I can’t. You know I can’t. To be rejected would end my illusions of hope, and without hope I can not dream.   The Butler: ( with alarm ) I’m sorry, but I saw what dreaming did to Walter; it killed him. ( reflectively ) A dream must be moved towards an end in reality, or it consumes the dreamer. I can see no other way.   The Poet: ( with conviction ) The life of a poet is the dream. God has plagued me with this heart, the tragedy being it is all I am. I’ve always valued your advice before but I can not follow it now. And I can see no other way.   The Butler: ( at a loss ) I don’t know what to say.   The Poet: ( looks at the folder then hands it to the Butler reluctantly ) There is nothing to say. ( sighs ) Well, I gotta go. See you later. ( climbs into the Jaguar and drives off, leaving theButler looking after him. The Butler turns and picks up the mail from the box, goes inside the gate and closes it behind him. )   Scene 15   Opens in the Abbey’s dining room the same morning. Ketcham sits alone in the throne-like chair dressed in a black silk robe and barefoot, sipping slowly at a cup of coffee. The lighting is provided by sunlight through the stained glass and the glowing embers of the fireplace to the right. The other fireplace has been stacked with kindling but is not lit. Enter a maid, dressed as such, with a large vase full of red roses.   Maid: ( with a heavy French accent ) Pardon, mademoiselle. Where is it you would like me to these put?   Ketcham: ( puts down her coffee cup ) Put these... Marie Isabelle, put these. ( shrugs noncommittally ) Oh, I don’t know, anywhere will do. ( the maid places the vase onto the right side of the table then exits. Enter Marv dressed in a black tuxedo with a bright yellow bow-tie and yellowish shoes. )   Marv: ( resting his elbows on the chair back to Ketcham’s left ) How’ya doin’, Ketch?   Ketcham: ( turning up from her coffee with an annoyed face ) All right, Marv.   Marv: ( nods in the direction of the roses ) I see the madman hasn’t given up yet. ( sits to Ketcham’s right )   Ketcham: ( tenaciously ) Marv, I really wish you would stop referring to him as a madman. He is eccentric, I’ll grant you that, but at least he isn’t a geek.   Marv: ( appearing offended, he fidgets nervously ) C’mon, Ketch, the guy sends you flowers and poetry but won’t let you know where he lives, or even talk to you face to face. You gonna tell me he isn’t just slightly off his rocker.. Jesus, he only met you twice and he thinks he’s madly in love with you. What about that poem you showed me, Day—jah View”, do you think you met him in another life?   Ketcham: ( picking up her cup, she peers into it and speaks softly ) I don’t know.., maybe. You wouldn’t understand, you couldn’t, you’re exactly the opposite of him. ( drinks some coffee, then speaks firmly ) You probably represent everything in man he hates!   Marv: ( stands huffily ) Yeah- I have money and he has nothing. It’s no wonder he hates me when I represent everything he can’t have. ( he reaches over and breaks a rose from its stem and sticks it into his lapel)   Ketcham: ( stridently ) Everything he didn’t want! ( Marv walks behind the bar, mixes a Bloody Mary in a large glass, and downs half of it in one gulp. Enter the Butler, sans outerwear, who hands Ketcham the mail, and then the manila folder he received earlier. )   The Butler: ( in his customary manner ) This arrived with the morning mail, miss.   Ketcham: ( points at the roses ) When did the roses come?   The Butler: ( at ease with his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes forward ) Late last night, miss. I discovered them on the veranda. If I may, Miss Ketcham, the fundraiser for the homeless of New York City is at noon today; should I bring cash again? If so, how much, and at what time would you like to depart? ( stepping back from the table with a slight bow, he moves to light the left fireplace )   Ketcham: ( following his movement with her head ) Bring cash... I don’t know... do you think fifty thousand is enough, or should it be more?   Marv: ( drops his glass, which shatters at his feet, and leans across the bar, bug-eyed ) You’re INSANE !!! How long do you think your money will last if you keep wasting it on bums and degenerates?   Ketcham ( glares at Marv with great distaste ) I don’t care what you think! ( sitting straight in her chair, she picks up the folder and looks at it, speaking almost to herself ) I would give it all away if my lawyers would let me. ( faces the Butler ) Have the car out front at ten. I want to stop in Central Park for a while before it starts.   The Butler: Thank you, miss. ( the Butler, seeing the fire is lit, rises and exits )   Marv: ( insultingly ) That damned poet went and poisoned your brain, You’re getting to be as crazy as he is!( Ketcham pushes away her coffee, stands and as she exits the room with the folder, she speaks over her shoulder )   Ketcham: Fuck you too, Marv.   Marv: ( moves from behind the bar, crunching glass under-foot, and sits in the throne ) If she wasn’t so rich, I’d probably hate her.   Scene 16   Opens on the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, same day, late morning. The Poet crawls groggily from under a bush left stage. He is dressed the same as earlier, but now has draped over his shoulders a beige blanket with Aqueduct Raceway stencilled across it in blue. Snow covers the ground with the exception of the pathways which have been shovelled. It is sunny yet very windy. The Poet watches scraps of paper scattering before the gusts, and joins the dancing litter holding the blanket as a sail. The wind carries him as he light-footedly skips to center stage, coming to a halt before Alice and bowing with a cavalier sweep of the blanket.   The Poet: ( brushes the top of the giant mushroom clear of snow and climbs up to have a seat )Mornin’, Princess- and how is everyone? What’ll it be today? ( directed at Alice ) A love poem declaring unending passion, ( to the Mad Hatter ) a poem about that nameless misery? ( pulling a small pad and pen from his back pocket, he flips to the last page ) I know, a poem about new shoes ( turns to the White Rabbit as if it had spoken ) You don’t think so, do you? Too materialistic? ( back to Alice ) How about this? ( writes one line and then reads it aloud ) To the victor goes the spoils and the loser toils long, ( asks Alice ) OK? ( then to rabbit ) OK ( he writes furiously for two minutes or so, then holds the pad up and continues reciting unemotionally) With the empty hearted earnings, not the love to form a song You can take away my smile, never know what joy I’ve had Chain me up or dig a graveyard, whip this spirit till it’s sad But you’ll never start comparing, for my purpose far from hell Way beyond just rhyme or reason, there’s a heaven, I can tell Not one tear of mine is useless, if it only does remind Shows the way for those behind me, opens eyes of humankind While the angel you may capture, as a devil standing doomed You are lost and simply winning, from the murk will emerge gloom It will shade you, overshadow, take your garden to a wilt Cast to shit the dreams of living, Break each brick that you have built…   ( looks to Alice ) “The Poet’s Lament” ( writes this down appearing pleased ) Yeah, that’s the title I would have chosen. ( asks the Cheshire Cat ) Work for you? ( with a slight laugh ) Ah, you’re a pushover anyway! ( hops off the mushroom as he closes the pad, then speaks to the Mad Hatter ) Here, this is for you. You’re probably the only one who’d understand it anyway. ( scrounging in the snow, he finds an empty Thunderbird bottle and weighs down the pad with it atop Alice’s mushroom in front of the hatter. The Poet then wanders elfishly away with a big smile on his face, disappearing into bushes left stage. Several minutes pass. Enter Ketcham with the manila folder in hand, dressed in blue jeans, white sneakers and a light blue down ski jacket which is zippered up to her chin. Leaning against the larger mushroom with a reminiscent look in her eyes, she searches the area where she first saw The Poet. She then pulls a poem from the folder and longingly reads it aloud. )   Ketcham: ‘Lingering Shy” ( she pauses, scanning the sheet, then continues ) If I love you though regardless of the fact you here won’t stay Let meander my emotions into heaven’s path and way Felt a simple fleeting moment I had touched upon your heart Made a difference, so substantial, being someone from the start Would you blame me, try to tame me, turn as cold and walk away Never notice, find me bogus- lost my mind and gone astray And I dreaming, short of screaming, what is it that I may do Catch a hold upon sweet angel- with my soul I yearn for you In that radiance, that glowing, in your eyes and in your smile Gentle voice, a song compelling, then there’s me-in fear, a child Who is praying- night and day been, for a miracle to come You could feel my love as joyous and return to me just some.   ( putting the poem back into the folder, a tear rolls down her cheek ) How can I when you won’t let me.... ( leaning further back onto the mushroom, she knocks the bottle and pad off into the snow. She picks up the pad and opens it, flipping through the pages, then searches the area hopefully ) Oh, why me! ( frustrated, she sighs ) Why me? ( starts to walk away but stops, pats down her pockets and finds a pen. Tearing the back cover off of the folder, she scribbles a note, then places it beneath the bottle on the mushroom, casting her eyes upward ) Please, God, if you’re out there let him find this… ( she glances at Alice reflectively, then walks off slowly, searchingly, exiting right stage. The Poet immediately re-enters left stage with an apprehensive expression, and approaches the note. Lifting the note from under the bottle as if it were a delicate flower, he reads it aloud. )   The Poet: ( tenderly ) My dearest poet, I don’t know what else to call you by, but please don’t be so sad. Give me a chance to get to know you. I’ll be here tomorrow at noon, and I really need to speak with you. There’s no reason to fear me, I’m not as bad as you may think. ( holds the note to his heart beneath the blanket ) Oh, sweet Ketch, it’s not you I fear, ( casting a saddened face to the ground ) It’s me....   Scene 17   Opens on the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, the next day at noon-time. A letter sits beneath a stone atop the mushroom, along with a red rose. Overcast and foggy, most of the snow has turned to gray slush. Enter Ketcham from right stage dressed in a black raincoat and designer-ripped blue jeans tucked into knee-high black leather boots; a white scarf is covering her hair. She paces anxiously for several minutes then sees the letter and picks it up. Opening it, she reads it aloud.   Ketcham: ( reading mechanically at first, then, as she progresses, a quaver enters her voice ) My dearest Ketcham, I hope someday you may forgive me, I know I can never forgive myself and will always regret this, but do this I must. Deep down in my heart, or maybe it goes beyond that, I feel I can’t bring you the love I so want to give. It is not that you do not inspire such love in me, I just can’t seem to love myself and believe I will always be inadequate. This goes so far beyond my even trying to explain it brings tears to my eyes. Having been a literal love-sick puppy since the very first time I saw you, I followed you, dreamt of you, and consumed my every moment in thoughts of you. Yet no matter how I feel, when the nightfall comes, so does my darkness of spirit. There is no more I can say that would make sense at all except that I love you and feel I have loved you forever. I will be gone before you receive this letter and pray you will accept me as having been just another screwed-up person whom you are better off not having gotten to know. Although I will never give up hope, for then I would be as good as dead, my faith falters and my soul, it cries. Please respect this, the only thing I have ever asked of you- don’t try to find me. Love forever, Hugh. ( Ketcham cries as she folds the letter and picks up the rose shakily ) Oh Hugh, dear Hugh, I never deserved even a moment of your love. ( scene fades to black as Ketcham stands weeping )   Scene 18   Opens in the Hermitage, The Poet’s home in Burgundy, France. It is a single room, ten foot by ten foot, with stone walls. The once-polished stone floors have had their lustre replaced by the grimy buffing of centuries of wear. The ceiling is low, and crumbling white plaster hangs in patches. To the right side of the room is a fireplace with a beautiful grey marble mantelpiece. Recesses to either side support rough-cut wooden shelves filled with home grown foods, home-made stone bowls, and other primitive household items. The left side of the room has a small single mattress with one blanket on a wooden frame. Central to the back wall is a three-by-five rough opening with a grey wooden shutter that has two diamond shapes cut into it for light. Hanging above this is a walnut crucifix with a mother-of-pearl inlay and a bronze figure of Christ. Before the shutter is an old rusty card table set up as a writing desk, upon which burns a candle and a section of log is set on end next to it as a seat. The Poet is before the fireplace trying to light the kindling, but he strikes one as being frustrated in his attempts. Dressed in a dirty beige flannel shirt, he has torn jeans and his feet are bare. His hair is longer and unruly, with streaks of grey. An old ratty pair of work boots are drying atop the mantelpiece.   The Poet: ( lifting his eyes towards the heavens ) Just once I wish this damned fire would keep lit all night. What do you want me to freeze to death?! I gave up the woman of my dreams, I devoted my life to helping the needy, I’ve written countless poems in your name, and I live like a monk with barely enough food. And what do I get- bad weather, rats that are to fast for me to catch, and this a suicide fire that would rather die than burn your sacred wood. SHIT’... That’s what I get! ( throws an entire box of matches at the smouldering fire, then flops down on the log seat in bewilderment ) Forgive me, God.... ( as if magically, the kind suddenly blazes ) Oh, I get it! Be humble, grovel a little! ( picks up a pen and swings his legs under the table ) Well, what’ll it be today...? I know- “Midnight Madness”! ( starts to write as he recites out loud ) Savage calmed by soothing bell- inside his cage still all’s not well Bewitching hour growing near- he can not rage nor rant his fear Evolving on an endless tide- by night he floods, by day he’s dried Surviving, thriving, pressed apart- he splits in two He’s soul, he’s heart...   ( puts down the pen and looks up at the crucifix ) Not good enough- I know! Jesus, just once, I beg you, let me have a nightmare. I can’t take this dreaming of Ketch. Last night she was pregnant, glowing like one of yours, and you wake me from such ecstatic heaven to this cold and lonely hell. When I’m awake, it’s misery, but I could learn to live with that, if I’d only stop dreaming of what could have been! ( cranes his neck about as if to see if someone is there ) Oh, boy- I’m losing it, aren’t I? ( sighs and rests his head in his hand for a moment, then picks up the pen and continues to write, reading aloud ) When the heart becomes a monster of a love so all alone It can tear the flesh of millions, rip a mountain to the bone Make a happy man depressive, take the meaning from a life Leave the fullest of them empty with the sharpness of a knife Shoot dear God down from the heavens   ( eyes the crucifix warily, then writes on )   knock the stars out of the sky It can breed a burning hatred, teach a statue how to cry Just may twist and bend a spirit to a lost and useless soul Kill that greatest form of beauty,dig a grave- sweet laughter’s hole When a love becomes a poison, all the pain and ill that’s born could become so over bearing that I dread to wake each morn...   Scene 19   Opens on the front room of the Tarafin Restaurant in the midst of serving the midday meal. To the right is a U-shaped counter. The front portion is made of brown wood-grained formica with a chalkboard describing the day’s lunch specials above which is a stainless steel cash register. The left side of the “U” is a glass case containing samples of gourmet cheeses, meats and pastries. The right counter, set against the wall, supports a soda fountain and a coffee machine, and contains beneath it dishes, utensils and other restaurant supplies neatly sorted on white formica shelves. In the background behind the counter is a wall painted white with a pine bat-wing door leading into the kitchen. In front of the counter on the right wall is a glass entrance door. To the left are two small tables, with two chairs each, set against a half-wall separating the entrance area from a room with a dozen booths. The floor is covered with linoleum tiles in a red-and-white diagonal pattern, and the ceilings are painted white with fluorescent lighting. Ketcham is behind the counter. Her hair is cut much shorter. She is dressed in blue jeans, a white sweater with green and brown patterns about the collar and cuffs, white sneakers, and a long thick gold chain around her neck. Looking much happier then we have seen her as of yet, she is adding up a check for an older gentleman when Leslie and Richland enter. Leslie, whom seems to have aged ten years, is dressed in a purple satin two-piece suit with matching shoes, adorned heavily with jewellery, and totes a black trunk of a purse. Richland is dressed in a grey three-piece pinstripe with grey vinyl shoes and a dark green tie. Realizing who they are, Ketcham is obviously taken aback. Richland, noticing her, stares for a few seconds then nudges Leslie in the side with his elbow and nods in Ketcham’s direction.   Leslie: ( exaggerating her drawl ) Well look who it is, Little Miss Bleedin’ Heart.... ( the older gentleman exits with a puzzled expression )   Richland: ( patting Leslie’s shoulder ) Now be nice, it’s not her fault if she’s insane.   Ketcham: ( shaking her head from side to side, a smile comes back to her face ) I can see you two have improved with fame and fortune!   Leslie: ( mockingly ) Tell me, Ketcham, honey- how’s it feel to have had it all and given it away? You must love that humble pie!   Ketcham: ( sincerely ) To tell you the truth, Les, I don’t miss it in the least. I never dreamt I’d be able to help so many people in so many ways. ( she hands two menus over the counter to Richland )   Richland: ( lowers his voice ) You know, I never could figure you out. What made you do it, Ketch? You had the world in the palm of your hand.   Ketcham: ( righteously ) You really want to know?! It was people like you two and Marv, who did it. I watched you abuse people. I read about you putting people out on the street homeless, so you could build parking garages. There’s no end to the amount of evil things you have done- and all the while I knew you were nothing but trash! ( Leslie, taking the menus from Richland’s hand, tosses them over the counter onto the floor in a fit of childish pique )   Leslie: ( loses drawl somewhat ) Come on, Richland-honey. This place is too common and sleazy for the likes of us.   Richland: ( antagonistically ) Wait, before we go- tell me Ketch, was it really us, or did ( snickers under his breath ) the poet do this to you?   Ketcham: ( picking up the menus off the floor ) You know, Rich, he was more of a loving human being than a hundred of you could ever be. The only thing you have ever loved has been money.   Richland: ( with a growl ) Yeah, well, from what I hear, he’s living in a hut near where the abbey used to be, and he’s gone stark raving mad. What kind of human being locks himself away from society to live with sheep and farmers? ( Ketcham’s smile disappears )   Leslie: ( pulls Richland out the door by the belt buckle ) Let’s get out of here. This bitch is probably just as crazy!   Ketcham: ( walking around the counter, she closes the door which was left open ) Dear God, what have you done…?   Scene 20   Opens in the Hermitage, some time after midnight. A savage wind howls outside, blowing snow through the diamond shaped holes in the shutter. The fire is out and one candle is burning on the mantelpiece. Lying under a thin blanket, troubled by his dreams, The Poet shivers fiercely and kicks and pulls at his covering. A moment passes, and as his body settles down, he murmurs in his sleep.   The Poet: ( happily ) Sweet, sweet Ketch.... ( a low tortured moan is heard, then the dragging of feet. Enter The Pointless One as an apparition encircled by a violet- blue glow. His pallor is a deathly grey, and dried blood stains his chest and back. The visible portions of his flesh are in an advanced state of decomposition. Bone shows on his face and hands, and his feet are worn to the skeleton, tatters of flesh hanging at his ankles. His hair has fallen out in patches, the remainder hanging in clumps and his fingernails have become twisted claws. Waking up groggily, The Poet sees The Pointless One and sits up horrified. Panicking, he flings himself against the left wall pulling the blanket with him as if it were a shield. )   The Poet: ( shrieks hoarsly ) Oh, Lord, what be you! ( The Poet tries to push himself up the wall to a standing position, but his legs fold nervelessly beneath him as The Pointless One stops in the center of the room and appears to hover from side to side )   The Pointless One: ( in almost a whisper ) Lost to oblivion the golden of heart When none have an interest the tarnishing starts ( in total fear The Poet throws the blanket at The Pointless One who then disappears with a flash )   The Poet: ( shaking so violently he’s ready to jump out of his skin ) Oh, God, help me.... ( sliding along the back wall, he knocks over the table, grabs a lantern from the shelf and lights it as quickly as possible. He then takes a box of candles from the shelf and proceeds cautiously around the room, placing lit candles everywhere possible until the room is fully aglow. Picking up the table and setting it back in place, he then kneels down in front of the crucifix and begins to pray fervently. )   Scene 21   Opens again in the Hermitage, later the same night. Most of the candles have burnt out, and the fire, having been relit, smolders dimly. Putting out the lantern and the remaining candles, The Poet stokes the fire and crawls into his bed with the blanket wrapped tightly around himself.   The Poet: Please, please, please, tell me I was dreaming.... ( suddenly the fire flares then dies to a flicker. The Poet gives a startled cry, then a sorrowed whimper. Re-enter The Pointless One, with a flash, exactly where he was last seen. )   The Pointless One: ( louder than last we heard him ) No gleaming or glowing no light to reflect As cracks form and flourish the beauty is wrecked An ornament- useless completely unknown Not felt- it is foolish turns dust of my bones   ( The Poet sits up very slowly, his back to the wall )   With wind dissipating spreads joy far away Where no one can find it love wastes fast- won’t stay...   ( The glow around The Pointless One changes to a brilliant blue-white that increases in intensity until The Poet is totally blinded, abruptly all goes black. )   Scene 22   Opens on the main kitchen of Castle No Surrender, home of Richland Logico, in Castleiney, County Tipperary, Ireland. The kitchen is huge, and has a row of tinted bay windows along the back wall looking out into a small valley through which there is a fast running river. The sun is shining brightly just over the horizon and the sky is clear. Inside the kitchen are two white double-door freezers and two beige double-door refrigerators lining the right wall. On the left wall’s front edge are two large oak sixteen pane French doors with crystal doorknobs. Just beyond that is a beige cooker as long and as wide as a Volkswagen, and then another set of French doors. Matching oak cabinets line beneath the bay windows and antique pots and pans made of copper are set in a horizontal half moon above the windows. The floors are black and white marble, the ceiling is cathedral and covered in white plaster. Lighting is provided by two electric chandeliers balanced to either side of a black marble table in the center of the room. Around the table are six wooden chairs matching the rest of the woodwork. Richland, Leslie and Marv are sitting at the table upon which are a silver coffee pot, cups, saucers, a napkin holder, and a tray of cookies. Richland is clothed in crimson silk pajamas with a burgundy robe, Leslie, a lavender dressing gown, and Marv is wearing a dingy white T-shirt and grey sweatpants. Richland pours each of them a cup of coffee as Marv paws through the cookies looking for something he likes.   Leslie: ( pours cream into her coffee ) I still can’t get over the nerve of her. Where does she come off thinking she’s better than us!   Marv: ( drops a shortbread cookie into his cup ) Ah, just forget about her, she’s just another loser-   Richland: ( interrupts rudely ) To tell you the truth, I thought she looked better for it all. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her look so happy— that is— until Imentioned the poet. Did you see the look on her face when I said he went crazy? ( looks to Leslie ) I thought she was going to cry.   Leslie: ( sips delicately, then speaks ) I expected her to start throwing things when we were on our way out the door. She’s always been moody anyway and now that she has to ( sneeringly ) work for a living!...For her parents no less!   Marv: ( gulps down coffee, spilling some onto the front of his shirt ) I just can’t understand why people like her and the poet give it all up. Nobody cares about them, why should they care about anybody else? She had the chance of a lifetime, compliments of our dear benefactor Walter-   Leslie: ( cuts in ) The nut case!   Marv: ( continues loudly ) And she totally blew it as if money wasn’t important. Go figure. . .   Richland: ( stands and pulls a napkin from the holder on the far side of the table ) I really think that poet is the one to blame! He brainwashed Ketcham with those scribblings of his, and he mooched off Walter till the day he died!   Marv: ( dabs at his shirt with a napkin ) Well, when I spoke with George De Zorzi, he said Walter bought the abbey from the poet. I don’t think he’d need to freeload with that kind of money.   Leslie: ( emphatically ) What a hypocrite! It’s like my daddy always says- “Damned liberals will be the downfall of society!”   Marv: ( finishes his coffee and pours another ) I’ve heard him say that about Republicans and Democrats too.   Leslie: ( sticks her tongue at Marv ) Well, you know what he means.   Richland: ( refuses with a wave of his hand when Marv offers him the tray of cookies ) How is your father anyway?   Leslie: ( with irritation ) You know, the same as always, keeps complaining about never having enough money, but won’t go out and work. Jesus, he’s only seventy two, I don’t see what the big deal is. He acts like I should support him or something.   Scene 23   Opens in the Hermitage, all is dark. We can barely make out the silhouette of The Poet crouched in a corner and we hear cascading water in the distance.   The Poet:Last of the hopeless romantics ( laughs softly, a gentle madman ) I cry helplessly to the winds of time,mine having come and gone. ( pauses ) Love remains only a memoryin a world todays and tomorrows ( pauses, them continues in a slightly louder voice ) No direction left for turning,no gods to fulfill my dreams ( pauses, continues softer ) I wither-useless in the strength so long cherished and nurtured ( pauses, raises voice again ) What of the heart- saintly in intentions? Could this truly be the destiny given? ( continues but raises voice even higher ) I close my eyes ( softer ) Picturing the vivid rainbow of past joys ( pauses, continues again loud ) Not enough-faith falters at the incessant nipping of reality ( stops for two or three minutes, continues in a whisper ) The plug is pulled-I drown in the air of life...   Scene 24   Opens on the narrow wooden bridge crossing the murky green moat of Castle No Surrender. It is a sunny summer day with very few clouds in the sky. To the left is the steep stone facade of the gate keep, rising forty feet and topped by massive crenulations. On the right is a paved road leading from the bridge to woods in the distance. The metallic clicking of gears can be heard as the huge iron-bound portcullis slowly lifts open. Richland steps out, dressed in a white cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled to just below his elbows, black chinos, and brown cowboy boots. Holding a cellular phone to his right ear, he paces and waves a .44 Magnum long-barrel pistol with his left hand.   Richland: ( yells into the phone ) Fuckin’ bitch, nobody forced you to invest all your money. Idon’t owe you a dime ... You think so, huh! You come ‘roundhere and I’ll kill you ... I mean it, I’ll kill you! ( enter Leslie’s bright red 450 SL Mercedes right stage, bursting out of the woods at a high speed. Dropping the phone, Richland assumes a two-handed shooter’s stance and begins firing off rounds at the approaching vehicle. ) I warned you, slut!!! ( emptying the pistol, Richland scrabbles in his pocket for shells to reload. As she reaches the bridge, Leslie accelerates madly, careening the car off the railings erratically. Richland finishing reloading, tries to aim again, but seeing the proximity of the car, attempts to jump out of the way as Leslie steers into his motion and splatters him and the car into the wall. Accordioning, the car tips to the side and does a firey back flip into the moat. )   Scene 25   Opens on Ketcham alone in the restaurant. Dressed in a white T-shirt upon which neon orange and pink letters spell out “Pinstripe”, she has on blue jeans and white sneakers. She is sitting at a table with an unopened letter in her hands. Looking at the return address nervously, she opens it and slowly reads it aloud.   Ketcham:Dear Miss Orelse, It is with a saddened heart that I must now inform you of the deaths of your companions Mr. Richland Logico and Miss Leslie Blackwater. It would appear that upon the fall of the European Common Market this Thursday past, they decided they preferred death to poverty. Yesterday morning their bodies were discovered at Castle No Surrender by a maid returning from a weekend of liberty. Due to the nature of their deaths, no wake will be held and the internment service will be on Friday forthcoming at 11 AM in Thurles. I regret to be the bearer of such unwelcome tidings and offer to you my sincerest condolences. Cordially, George De Zorzi.( she puts down the letter with an empty expression on her face )I don’t know if you deserve it, but may God forgive you both!   Scene 26   Opens on Thurles Cemetery, County Tipperary, Ireland. It is cold, overcast and drizzling. A priest, dressed as such, stands at the head of two cheap plywood coffins reciting quickly the memorial rites in Latin. Ketcham, wearing a knee-length black dress with black spike heels and a brimless black and white hat, stands alongside Marv, who is dressed in a grey three-piece suit with black patent-leather shoes. He is swaying back and forth, obviously drunk, and barely able to hold himself up. The priest, seeing this, finishes abruptly and the coffins are lowered one by one into the ground by two workmen who have been standing off to the side. As the priest and the workmen exit stage left, Marv teeters and starts to fall into an open grave as Ketcham grabs hold of him, pulling him back to his feet.   Ketcham: ( seeming worried ) Come on, Marv. Let me bring you back to the restaurant. You look like you need a cup of coffee.( Marv stands fully erect collecting himself, and pulls a pint bottle of Irish Mist from his inner jacket pocket )   Marv : I don’t need your help! I don’t need nobody’s help. I got all I need right here. ( opens the bottle, and polishes it off, then throws the empty bottle into a grave with a crash )   Ketcham: ( tugs at his sleeve ) Don’t be a jerk, Marv. You’re drunk and I’m not going to let you drive like this! Where are you staying, I’ll take you home?   Marv: ( pushes her away, sounding like a little kid ) You’re not going to tell me you don’t know... are you?   Ketcham: ( warily ) I don’t know what, Marv?   Marv: ( coughing in violent spasms, he spits out blood) I lost everything, I spent it all! I owe more than I’ll ever get... I don’t even have a place to live anymore!   Ketcham: ( tries to latch onto Marv’s arm to keep him from falling ) It’s not important, Marv. I’ll fix you up, I can help. ( pushing away from Ketcham, Marv falls into a grave with a thud. She gives him a hand out, but he almost pulls her in while she does so. )   Marv: ( self-pityingly ) I don’t deserve your help. ( drops to his knees crying ) I’m a bastard and you’ve always known it.   Ketcham ( consolingly ) You’ve never been that, you’re just sometimes hard to take.   Marv: ( wipes his nose on his sleeve ) He was right. I never thought I’d admit it. The only person I ever loved was myself. And my friends, you see what happened to them. ( gestures towards the open graves ) They were just like me.   Ketcham: ( stands next to Marv and puts a comforting hand on his shoulder ) It’s not too late to change. I can help you find a job and a place to stay.   Marv: ( yells shrilly ) Just leave me the fuck alone!   Ketcham: ( steps back as Marv takes a feeble swing at her ) Think about it, you know where to find me when you’re ready. ( she starts to back away as Marv reaches into his vest and pulls out a gun. Seeing it, Ketcham screams desperately and lunges at him, trying to take it away ) No! ( she is too late as he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. He falls forward and twitches violently for a moment then stops. Ketcham, on her knees, pounds him on the back three times with her fist screaming ) No! No! No! NO! ( turning him on his side, she pulls him into her arms crying hysterically as the priest, the workmen and several others come running ) You fool, you poor, poor fool!   Scene 27   Opens in the Hermitage. The shutters are open revealing to us, across a valley, the lit bell tower of Flavigny framed by a star-filled spring sky. The fireplace being unlit, lighting is provided by the lantern on the table. Standing between it and the bed, The Poet is dressed the same as before, except now his shoes are on and his clothes are torn and filthy. His hair is knotted and wild-looking and he appears sickly, as if he hasn’t eaten in weeks. With a pale color, he has large blue-black bags under the eyes from sleep deprivation.   The Poet: ( ardently ) Heart of woe- I do implore,my soul release through heaven’s door Too much the pain- just can’t exist when love won’t stay- does cease, desist Takes all I have- both good and bad away from me- to drive past mad Until remains only a stain  where true should be a joyous gain Oh heart, oh heart- no longer bear this life please end if none do care.   ( The Poet punches the stone wall near the rough opening, first softly then with increasing strength until blood spatters on the wall. Kicking the bed, he goes into a wild frenzy, swiping shelves clear, knocking over the table and the lantern, and thus setting the entire front of the stage ablaze. As a curtain of flame shoots towards the ceiling, obscuring The Poet, we see the bed frame heaved above the mantelpiece, and then the crucifix falls from the wall. The scene ends in a raging fire. )   Scene 28   Opens in front of the Hermitage, it is a sunny autumn morning. In ruins, the walls are partially fallen and nothing remains of the roof but a few charred timbers. Dew covered vines have overgrown everything, and foliage obscures the valley in the background. Ketcham stands before the entrance dressed in a Navy blue trench coat, blue jeans and suede hiking boots. She appears to have aged slightly around the eyes and her hair has grayed a bit. Kicking around some of the debris, deep in thought, she notices some charcoal writing on the outside wall to the left of the doorway. Pulling the vines aside, she steps back exposing a poem to the audience.   “The Waking”   As a fire I burn- feeling unfulfilled I yearn By the masses I am spurned Oh dear God, what have I earned Was the evil overpowering that you’d send my soul away Cast my spirit down from heaven deep in hell that I must stay Are there prayers still remaining- may the good I repossess Could I beg you or implore you to your love, my life address It too late for my redemption- giving time that I may sweat Now I tell you in all honestyI truly do regret Oh dear God, please don’t forsake me-I’m in need another chance Try my best- my very hardest Leave me not to circumstance.   ( Ketcham reads the poem thoughtfully, then hesitantlypulls the vines from the right side of the doorway, exposing another poem )   “Ketch”   I won’t run if you should chase me But would meet with open arms the embrace of your affection with a love to keep you warm Not the lust of earthly body from the soul- a spirit free That will last beyond a lifetime Till the end- eternity...   Scene 29   Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, it is a sunny mild day. Enter The Poet left stage and Ketcham right stage. The Poet is dressed in an RCA Pink Puppy T-shirt, new blue jeans, new work boots, and his hair and beard are neatly trimmed. Ketcham is wearing her black oriental robe/dress, and black ballet slippers. Both move to center stage in front of Alice, staring each other lovingly in the eyes. The Poet takes Ketcham’s hands in his.   The Poet:Hold tight the thought! Ketcham:The feel? The Poet:It’s free my love! Ketcham:Not fake? The Poet: But real! Ketcham: Unlike a dream? The Poet: Has sustenance! Ketcham: Is always there? The Poet: Makes so much sense! Ketcham: Not bought? The Poet: Not sold! Both: Just made for you! Ketcham: Inside my heart! The Poet: And always true!   ( close scene as they gently embrace )   Scene 30   Opens in the front room of the Tarafin. Ketcham is dressed in brown corduroy pants, a white silk blouse, and white low-heel shoes. She is in the process of closing out the register as the last three patrons file out the door. Enter The Poet dressed in his dark blue wool dress jacket and beige Hudson Bay blazer. He has on dark brown shoes and dress jeans, and is wearing his gold- rimmed glasses.   Ketcham: ( acknowledges him with a faint smile upon her face) Hello.   The Poet: ( stretches across the counter to give her a shy kiss on the cheek ) How was it today, busy?   Ketcham ( looks back down at cash register as she counts the day’s till ) It’s always busy right before Christmas. I guess people are so busy shopping they don’t feel like cooking when they get home.   The Poet: ( leans against the counter watching Ketcham with a saddened face ) Any news from your brother in New York yet? Did they have the baby?   Ketcham: ( still counting, she speaks quickly ) No, but I think my parents are going to see him when the baby does come. I wanted to go, but someone has to mind the restaurant, and I was the last one to see him, so it’s their turn.   The Poet: ( pulls a poem from the inside pocket of his jacket ) Here’s your poem for the day. I wrote it last night after I took you home. It took me quite a long time to write you something happy and upbeat. ( he hands the poem over to Ketcham who slides it into her pocket nonchalantly )   Ketcham: ( wraps a rubber band around the bills ) Thanks, I’ll read it later. I have to close up fast, Friends are picking me up and I’m going to Dublin tonight. I’ll be spending the weekend.   The Poet: ( standing, he shuffles his feet nervously ) I’ll be leaving in a few hours for Limerick. My plane takes off tomorrow at twelve fifteen, but I have to check in around eight thirty.   Ketcham: ( places the till into a black cloth bag and puts the stack of receipts away under the counter ) Well, I guess I’ll see you sometime in March, but I have to leave the twenty first for Lourdes. I’m going there for two weeks.   The Poet: ( takes off his glasses and dabs at the corner of his left eye while Ketcham is turned ) I wish so much I wasn’t leaving, I’m going to miss you terribly!   Ketcham: ( walks around the counter, picking up a small red purse and her ski jacket from a nearby table, still holding the till bag ) I’ll keep in touch, I have your address... ( The Poet gently pulls Ketcham to him and gives her a kiss, then a hug. As he does this, he tears and wipes his eyes with the back of his hand in which he has his glasses. Ketcham seems unaware. )   The Poet: ( tries to seem positive ) I won’t be home until January third, and I won’t be any one place in France long enough for you to write me. But please don’t forget me. I love you. ( Ketcham steps away from his hug, turns off all the lights but one, and pulls her keys from inside her purse as both exit stage right )   Scene 31   Opens in the Duram Arms Pub just outside Limerick City, later the same night. The bar is partially filled with a mixed crowd of tourists and locals. Along the left wall is a red mahogany bar stretching a hundred feet or so into the background. On the right wall are three blazing fireplaces spaced by bay windows. There are several rows of booths in the center with six billiard tables in the back. The Poet sits alone in a booth near an exit with many empty glasses in front of him. Obviously intoxicated, he looks ill and unhappy, and is in the process of writing a letter which seems to give him a great deal of trouble. One of the bartenders, a man in his early forties dressed in black pants and a white shirt, walks over with a tray to clear the empty glasses.   The Poet: ( glances up from his letter ) Could I have another Irish coffee, please?   Bartender: ( speaking with a brogue, he loads glasses onto the tray ) I’m sorry, but you have drank more of those than I usually serve in a week. I have to cut you off, it’s closing time. Why don’t you go back to where you’re staying, and try to relax.   The Poet: ( standing with a struggle, he puts the pen away in his pocket ) Alright, I’m sorry if I troubled you. ( The Poet staggers towards the exit as the bartender picks up the unfinished letter and calls after him )   Bartender: ( waves the letter ) Hey, you’re forgetting this!   The Poet: ( not even looking back ) No, I’m not! ( the Poet exits and the bartender inspects the letter briefly, then recites it aloud to some of the regulars at the bar )   Bartender: ( humorously ) My love, I am not apart from you for two hours and I feel the need to obliterate my misery in alcohol; too bad it didn’t work. I cannot find it in myself to stay happy as you asked, and once again feel that nagging sensation that I will never be enough for you. It is not that I do not love you- I love you more than anything or anyone I have ever known- yet, I feel so inadequate, that I don’t want to put you through anymore of my poison. ( various patrons break out in laughter as the bartender crumples up the letter and pitches it across the room into an open fireplace ) If all that whiskey didn’t make him forget his troubles, he’s not going to.   Scene 32   Opens in an apartment in Paris, France, Christmas Eve. Rear center stage, The Poet lies on a fold-out bed covered by a brown blanket. The bed is in a living room beneath a large plate glass window through which we can see the Eiffel Tower aglow in the Parisian night. Next to the bed is a lit pedestal lamp. On the left side of the room is a student desk with a blotter, a small fluorescent light, and a chair in front of it with The Poet’s clothes draped on the back. Against the right wall is a book shelf and a stereo rack with a duffel bag propped against it. In the background can be heard the banging and moaning of two people violently making love; with each groan The Poet cringes.   The Poet: ( pleadingly ) Oh, dear Lord, why couldn’t you let me die at the Hermitage? You let me be happy for a week, and then subject me to this. ( a loud moan is heard, and The Poet cringes ) What do I have to do for her to say she loves me? Even if it had been a lie- it would have been better than this. Please give me faith. You give me hope, but it’s faith I need! I’ve never been so torn up in my life. I want to believe she loves me, but that it will just take her some time to say it, yet, I see so many signs that turn my mind and make me believe she just wanted me to go without having to hurt me face to face. Don’t let this be sympathy. I don’t want pity, I want her love! ( reaches up and shuts off the light. In the darkness can be heard the sounds of him softly crying. )   Scene 33   Opens in the Tarafin. It is late evening and Ketcham is alone at the table where she received the news of Richland’s and Leslie’s deaths. She is dressed in an orange T-shirt and blue jeans, her shoes are kicked off after a long day at work. Before her on the table are a small package and a letter. She opens the package and finds a gold-colored bracelet set with green and white stones. After examining it she puts it down and opens the letter. As she reads it silently, we can hear The Poet’s voice.   The Poet: ( fervently ) Dear Ketcham, I was sitting in Shannon Airport waiting for my plane to leave when a terrible feeling came over me. On the last night we spent together you told me I had done nothing wrong, that you were just slightly overwhelmed by all my affections and attentions. The one thing I did do majorly wrong besides briefly letting the wolf in me take control was to tell you it was all or nothing. I could not bear to be only your friend because of how strongly I feel towards you. I realize now that I would rather have your friendship then nothing at all. Having searched long hard in the Shannon Duty-Free for a friendship ring, if that is what they are called, but finding none I thought nice or which I could afford, I found this bracelet. Although it is not the real thing, I hope you will accept it as a symbol of friendship between us. I also would like to wish you and your family a Merry Christmas as I forgot to do so before my leaving. Hoping all is well. Love, Hugh.   Ketcham: ( puts down the letter and picks up the bracelet again ) Damn, how do I deal with this...?   Scene 34   Opens on The Poet as he walks around inside of the ruins of the Hermitage, with a lantern in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. Dressed in a navy blue parka and grey ski pants, his heavy black rubber boots make a flapping noise as he walks. It is night time and snowing slightly, there is four to five inches of snow on the ground already. Kicking one inside corner free of snow and debris, The Poet sits against the wall with the lantern a few feet away. Suddenly the wind picks up and although the flame to the lantern is shielded, it blows out.   The Poet: ( irritated ) Shit! No matches left. ( enter Richland and Leslie as apparitions. Dressed in scorched blood-soaked clothing, both have horribly distorted faces and are consumed in the same sickly violet glow as The Pointless One. The Poet gapes at the bottle in his hand then throws it at the figures. ) NO….   Richland: ( his image flickering briefly ) Fear us not, oh Poet, for we are the essence of the faith you need.   Leslie: ( gestures with her hand ) Look upon us and remember well.   Richland: ( places his hand over his heart ) Our lack of faith...   Leslie: Our lack of humanity…   Richland: ( balls his fists before him ) Has brought us to these ruins, for we are destined to walk forever the corridors of eternity.   Leslie: ( points at The Poet ) There is no escape- no doors to exit.   Richland: ( gestures open-handed towards The Poet ) Yet you, Poet, hold the key to heaven. Fear not the door before which you stand.   Leslie: ( speaks as both begin to fade ) Forget not your love in spirit. Though in body you may burn, your spirit shall prevail.   ( both disappear without having moved from place as the lantern relights by itself. Astonished, The Poet bolts out the doorway, leaving the lantern behind. )   Scene 35   Opens on The Poet seated at a table outside a cafe in Paris. His beige Hudson Bay blazer hangs over the back of his seat and he is dressed in blue jeans, work boots, and a Mickey Mouse T-shirt with the American Flag outlined in the shape of the United States. His hair neatly brushed, he seems to have lost his grey. In the background is the Arc de Triomphe, lit in the evening twilight. Before him sits a large heavy-set German man who is rolling up his sleeve. To the right is a table littered with empty Heineken bottles to which The Poet adds one more. The Poet sets his elbow on the table and proceeds to arm-wrestle with the German. As he does so, a crowd forms around the two cheering for the German, patting him on the back. The Poet puts down his opponent with only a slight effort and is booed by the crowd. Seeing who the victor is, a waitress comes and gives another Heineken to The Poet, which the German pays for grudgingly. Storming off, he is replaced by a younger punked-out Frenchman as The Poet finishes the beer with one good guzzle. Toying with him, The Poet wrestles this fellow with ease, laughing and cursing at him in English in the process. The waitress arrives with another beer which the loser pays for as the crowd walks away bored with watching The Poet win constantly. For a moment The Poet sits alone, and then from in the shadows appears the German with five friends. Sensing something is about to happen, The Poet attempts to stand but is stopped before he has a chance when all five of the German’s companions grab a hold of him. Two men grab each arm, pinning his hands on the table, and one holds him in a headlock as the German man who lost proceeds to smash The Poet’s hands with bottles from the table next to them. The German stabs into The Poet’s forearms with a broken bottle until he passes out in pain. They drop The Poet, leaving him slumped face first on the table which is covered with broken glass and blood, and run off just as a gendarme arrives. Quickly checking for a pulse, the gendarme calls through the doorway for an ambulance.  Scene 36   Opens in the Abbey dining room, it is night and the room is lit by the torches behind The Poet who is sitting alone in the throne-like chair. He is wearing in the same clothes he had in the cafe in Paris. Enter Ketcham, dressed as she was in the cemetery, arm-in-arm with a tall handsome Englishman. The Poet stands appalled as they approach him.   Ketcham: ( pleasantly ) Hugh, I’d like you to meet Peter my fiancé. I know this may be hard on you, but I love him and have since the first time we met. You can understand that, can’t you?   The Poet: ( desperately ) But I thought you loved me, you told me you did!   Ketcham: ( with a sardonic smile ) I never said that- but I do love you- I’m just not in love with you. Peter here ( touches Peter’s cheek lovingly ) is the one I’m in love with!   Peter: ( extending his hand to shake The Poet’s ) Sorry old fellow, to the victors go the spoils and all that! ( The Poet falls back into his chair without having shaken Peter’s hand and tears roll down his cheek as anger starts to build in his face )   The Poet: ( tight voiced ) Please Ketch, just leave, don’t put me through this.   Ketcham: ( flippantly ) Oh, Hugh, don’t be this way, you’ll find someone else. There are plenty of nice girls out there. You’ll see, you’ll forget me real soon.   The Poet: ( bordering rage ) Damn it. will you just leave! You break my heart and you expect me ( pauses confused, then yells ) Just leave!! ( Ketcham gazes at The Poet with pity in her eyes, then smiles at Peter, who smiles back. Shrugging once, they exit, leaving The Poet alone. ) Have mercy on me. ... ( putting his head down onto the table, he sobs as the lights dim. A few moments pass and The Poet becomes aware of a dripping sound on the table to his right. Turning his head without raising it, he opens his eyes to see Marv in a comparable position facing him. The dripping is blood oozing out of his head forming a puddle on the table. Dressed the same as when he died, the pink color of his skin is solely the mortician’s make-up. As he sits up, we see the neat entry hole of the bullet on his right temple, behind his left ear is the messy exit wound. )   Marv: ( cynically ) God won’t have mercy on you; he died a long time ago. ( Panicking, The Poet thrusts himself away from Marv. Tripping on his chair leg, he knocks over the chairs next to him and falls to the floor. As Marv gets up and approaches him, The Poet franticly tries to scramble away. Marv paces The Poet menacingly.) What’s-a-matter? ‘Fraid of a little blood? ( shakes his head and splatters brains and blood all over The Poet’s face and shirt ) Come on! I thought you had the stomach for these types of things. You’ve revelled in death all your life- why are you so afraid of it now?!   The Poet: ( pleadingly ) Just go away, you’re dead, I know you’re dead.   Marv: ( good-naturedly ) Oh come now, I may be dead, but I’m no worse off than you. ( he corners The Poet against the base of the bar ) You hypocrite, you preach how great love is, but look at you now... you’re a mess! Even I, the heartless monster that I am, I’m not so pitiful, am I? ( in fear, The Poet closes his eyes ) Come now, precious, you’ve prayed for death, well here I am! ( Marv laughs with insanity in his eyes )   The Poet: ( turns his head away ) I don’t want to die; I just want my misery to end. ( moving behind the bar, Marv fixes a Bloody Mary as The Poet opens his eyes to see what is happening )   Marv: ( picking up a stirrer, he swirls his drink ) Misery- hah! So that’s what you call it! The trouble with you is you don’t know when to call a spade - a spade. Misery— jeez! ( gulps drink and rubs stomach appreciatively ) You’re a tormented soul! Your body knows misery, but your real problem is your soul! ( finishes his drink then moves back to The Poet ) Tell me if I’m wrong! ( bends down so he is eye-to-eye with The Poet ) All your life you have dark and shaded dreams about a woman who gives you great love and affection, then one day, lo and behold! There she is, a thousand dreams of joy right before your very eyes. And what do you do?! Hide because you’re not good enough, you think. Fill your heart with pity and suffering, hating yourself, letting your physical body turn to shit. And they say I was a basket case! ( gives an amused laugh) Why don’t you just admit it, you weren’t meant to be happy. Here, ( picks up a steak knife from the bar ) let’s get it over with once and for all! ( pushes the knife into The Poet’s hands and places the point against his chest ) Do it! You woosie, do it!   The Poet: ( throws the knife away ) I can’t! ( cries as if he wishes he could ) I love her too much- she’d never forgive me!   Marv: ( slams his palm down onto the bar ) Never forgive you?! She doesn’t care about you!! You don’t even exist in her mind! ( walks over to pick up the knife, then goes back to The Poet, leaving a trail of maggots behind him which fall out of the back of his head ) Well then, I guess I’ll just have to do it for you. ( he lunges with the knife at The Poet who tries to dodge but fails, and catches the blade in his shoulder with a scream. The scene fades to black with him defending himself, and then explodes in light with The Poet on an emergency room table, surrounded by hospital staff and equipment, still fighting. )   Doctor: ( with a French accent ) Hold still, Monsieur. ( turns to a nurse and issues a quick succession of orders in French as several attendants grab The Poet and hold him down. Filling a syringe, a nurse gives The Poet a shot of anaesthesia, and he passes out as the doctor continues to stitch up gashes in his shoulder and arms. )                                                                     Scene 37   Opens in a thatched cottage somewhere in the middle of Ireland. Right stage, against a white-washed stone wall, is a large brass bed with a small night table next to it. Center stage is a plain wooden door. Left stage is a bureau with three unopened suitcases atop it. Overhead is a small single electric light bulb which is on. Enter Ketcham dressed in a tight fitting black dress, black heels, a pearl necklace, and The Poet’s bracelet. She is accompanied by a good-looking Irishman with blue green eyes, short brown hair, and sharp features. He is dressed in a two-piece woollen men’s suit, white shirt, red tie and black shoes. He has his arm around her as they enter, and they are laughing, joyously drunk.   Irishman: ( pulls Ketcham to him ) I’d like to thank you for a wonderful send-off for the New Year. ( he gives her a long passionate kiss while rubbing his hands up and down her spine )   Ketcham: ( stepping back, she takes both his hands ) Thank you; I had a wonderful time myself. ( the Irishman leads her to the edge of the bed, and they both sit down ) You’d better be going- it’s late and I have a lot of work to be doing tomorrow. ( the Irishman grabs her and plants another kiss on her. She pushes him away, and he falls back onto the bed with a frustrated sigh. Looking briefly at the bracelet on her wrist, she takes it off and places it on the night table then reaches over and switches off the light. )   Scene 38   Opens on a private room in a hospital in Paris. Center stage The Poet lies in a bed set in a semi-upright position, both his forearms in casts. An intravenous bottle hangs on the right, with a tube running to his arm. He is alone, and the room is dimly lit from a window to the left. A beige phone is next to him on a small light green metal table set against the bed. The phone rings and he struggles to put the receiver to his ear.   The Poet: ( half-conscious ) Hello!( dropping the phone, he picks it up again ) Walter? Walter De Zorzi! How ya been?... Well, a happy new year to you too! How did you know I was here?... Yes, it certainly has been a long time. How’s the crew at Club Mud?... And Myron how’s he?... No, I didn’t break them- someone else did. Yeah, I was too drunk to defend myself…. No- I’ll be alright, just have to use a tape recorder for a while...... I know! Well what can a crazy poet do! I’m supposed to leave the day after tomorrow, God willing. I’ll be passing through Shannon for one night.... No, I have a package to deliver to Thurles.... You guessed it— a beautiful young Irish girl. Funny thing though! She doesn’t know me from Adam, but I feel like I’ve loved her forever!... No, it’s more than just deja vu. I can’t even explain- sort of my own personal angel.... Well, devil then! So, I’m a nut job- I believe in miracles.... At the airport, sure, I’d love it if you would..... Five twenty five PM on Air Lingus flight one thirteen, JFK.... See you then, and thanks for calling. ( hangs up ) Well, stranger, here goes nothing...     Scene 39   Opens on the filled back dining room of the restaurant on Teague Road. Through the right rear window we can see it is dark outside. Anne Marie is dressed in a white blouse, dark green corduroys, and black shoes. She stands to the left foreground, alongside Marie, who is dressed as first we saw her. The background noise lowers as their conversation becomes distinguishable mid-sentence.   Marie: ( placing her hand on Anne Marie’s shoulder )… besides Anne Marie, you can do better! ( a spotlight illuminates The Poet who is in the same booth with his back to the wall. He is wearing blue jeans, work boots, and a white T-shirt with a caricature of a deranged duck freaking out and screaming “I’ve got an attitude!” Painfully trying to hold a pen, he is writing on a brown paper package. ) Look at him for instance! He looks interesting. Slightly damaged, but you need some new blood in your life.   Anne Marie: ( elbows Marie ) Cut it out!( standing, The Poet walks slowly across the room, the package pinched beneath his right arm, and his left hand concealed behind his back. The wall lights come on in the background as he approaches the two. ) Oh shit, I think he heard you!   The Poet: ( speaks to Anne Marie sheepishly ) Excuse me, miss. I, uhm, wrote you a screenplay. ( hands the package to her and steps back )One day last month you served me dinner and I haven’t been able to get you off my mind since. Please, I’d be honoured if you’d accept it. ( lets his left arm fall slightly behind his back, then, as if he just remembered, pulls out a fist full of roses and places them in Anne Marie’s free hand ) Oh... and these... it’s a custom!   Anne Marie: ( looking first at the flowers, then to Marie, she turns back to The Poet with a blush on her cheeks ) I don’t know what to say....   The Poet: ( blushes too ) Say nothing! I know this is strange, but I met you once and I’ve been in a dream ever since. Here it is, I wrote it all down.   Anne Marie: ( holds up the package ) Don’t you want this back?   The Poet: ( backs away ) No, it’s finished with now. Listen, I’ve a plane to Ketch... uh, catch. I hope you enjoy it. ( He turns and exits leaving both Anne Marie and Marie looking bewildered )   Anne Marie: ( astounded ) Who in hell was that?   Scene 40   Opens on a sunny Central Park, at the foot of the lake. In the background is the Alice-In-Wonderland exhibit, beneath which The Pointless One lies asleep or dead, half covered in newspapers. The Poet is dressed as we saw him in the previous scene with a red flannel shirt draped over his shoulders. With him is Walter De Zorzi, who bears a striking resemblance to the Butler, yet has a ruddy complexion as opposed to green. Dressed in a gray herringbone sport jacket, a pale yellow shirt, brown polyester pants, and brown shoes and socks, he and The Poet stand at the edge of the lake.   Walter: So how did you meet this girl, what’s her name, Anne Marie?   The Poet: To tell you the truth, Walter, I went in for dinner one day, and there she was. I didn’t even talk to her, it was my usual hit-and-run.   Walter: So the story you gave her, what was it about?   The Poet: Sort of a déjà vu-reincarnation thing, but not really. More about multiple realities.   Walter: Yours or hers? I should assume she’s in it, when you write poetry, you generally write it directed to someone.   The Poet: Not just mine or hers, it’s what she represents in this case, love. The Poet, who is the main character of the story, creates a fictitious romance which he lives out in his own peculiar reality. He’s not just one person looking for a lover; he’s everyone looking for love.   Walter: And how does she fit into this? You wrote about her, and you don’t even know her.   The Poet: It’s not her I was writing about, it’s the love that I visualized in my mind. The pains and the joys... the point being I experienced pure love. If I had known her it would have been different. Reality as the world dictates it tends to blunt the edges of what the mind and the heart can know. This six foot universe ( stretches arms out indicating a sphere around him ) in which each of us live is strictly subjective. What do you think?   Walter: Reality sucks. But you have to learn to live with it. You can express yourself or fulfil yourself in the gym, at the office, in a nightclub, or in your own imagination. As long as you’re able to satisfy what the world demands of you, you can do anything you want.   The Poet: So am I masochistic because my dreams surpass my realities and maybe prevent what could be in reality?   Walter: I think you get satisfaction from your dreams, but are unhappy because they’re not real.   The Poet: Says who?

"           The following is a research paper I wrote for my pastor on postmodernism. It's long, poorly written, and I don't expect you to finish it. But maybe you can help me if I misrepresented aonyone's views.    Introduction   When being asked to define postmodernism, I just sort of blink with apprehension, because its like being asked what color is a rainbow? Many people dont realize that the way people think has changed from intellectually categorizing certain essential distinctives, to experiencing a variety of well experiences. Reminiscent of The Matrix, my glib reply is 'I know what postmodernism is, but I cant explain it to you. You will have to see it for yourself. Obviously, postmodernism is very frustrating to many people, and is usually received with suspicion and skepticism. In this essay I will attempt to demonstrate that postmodernism is not indefinable, nor is it something to fear. I will explain by historical and philosophical methods how postmodernism came about, what it is, and how Evangelical Christians can respond. My hope is that after reading this essay postmodernism will be viewed as a very interesting and challenging way of thinking about and relating to God.   Lets go back to the rainbow analogy. A rainbow is comprised of many different colors. No one color can be used to describe it. It is, in itself, a symbol of diversity that displays a colorful image of different colors, not mixed, but alongside one another. This is a key idea to understanding postmodernism. Modernism, if you will, has become just another color in the rainbow. Now, ironically, many modern Evangelicals, or modern thinkers for that matter, dont even know what the word 'modernism' means.    What the Heck is Modernism Anyway?   In the Christian context, the word ' urlLink modernism ' was used by Pope Pius X to describe the endeavor to reconcile the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church with the conclusions of modern science. It was a methodology of thought in which certain Biblical questions, apologetics, and the theory of dogma would be validated by rational, scientific explanation.  The Enlightenment, represented by  urlLink Descartes  and  urlLink Hume , along with  urlLink Galileo  and  urlLink Sir Isaac Newton , brought forth a type of thinking that was purely rational and scientific. The scientific method and pure rational thinking became the authorative way in which we came to know truth (Epistemology). If you had no empirical proof of what you thought was true, you were treated with skepticism. This, of course, has been around even before the Enlightenment. St. Thomas Aquinas  urlLink works  are written with very little style or creativity, because his aim was to be as scholarly as possible in his approach to whatever questions came his way, and of course, we know Aquinas was heavily influenced by the logical realism of Aristotle.    What these philosophers were trying to accomplish in there thinking was the goal of laying down objective foundations.  urlLink Stanley J. Grenz  says, 'The Enlightenment epistemological foundation consists of a set of incontestable or unassailable first principles on the basis of which knowledge can proceed. These basic beliefs must be universal, objective, and discernible to any rational person'. One of the foundational beliefs of the modern age was in science, and it was crowned as the method in which all things can become known. The most widely accepted position of the modern era was scientific naturalism, in which spirituality became nominal and superstitious (see  urlLink David Hume ).    A Little History   How this relates to the Church is hugely important. After Aquinas we had Luthers reformation and after the reformation the church fragmented into what we now call 'denominations' that either became liberal, or conservative. The conservative denominations were able to agree on five fundamental truths that were articulated in a series of booklets called  urlLink The Fundamentals  published around 1909. The articles were written to identify the foundational doctrines of Christianity that were, at the time, under heavy scientific scrutiny. The five foundations were The inspiration and infallibility of the Bible, The deity of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the second coming of Christ. Liberal and conservative theologians disputed these foundations heavily for the next decade, until the great earthquake of Darwinism rocked the religious community.  During the 1920s fundamentalist Christians were publicly humiliated by the Scopes Monkey trial. Scopes was a public school teacher in Tennessee where you couldnt teach anything that was against Biblical creationism. He taught evolution and therefore broke the law and was brought to trial in 1925. The case drew huge attention, and even though Scopes lost the case, the fundamentalist Christians came across embarrassingly ignorant and public opinion drove Christians from the public square and they stayed quiet until the 1980s ( urlLink Blinded by Might ). It was not until Jerry Falwells Moral Majority delivered a crushing blow to its political opponents that forced the public once again to deal with Christians. It seemed as though utopia would return, morality would be legislated, and God would eventually win back the heart of society. The problem was, the peoples thinking had changed, and the church had not.   In the 1960s and 70s growth in Para church organizations like Campus Crusade for Christ, the Navigators, and the Jesus People exploded, and they took traditional churches by surprise. The movement was unlike any they had ever seen. People, like my parents and my pastor, were meeting in small dorm-rooms or apartments, breaking the bread and singing worship songs with nothing more than a guitar. They would reach out to people in a variety of ways, helping people move, inviting their friends to diner, and yes, by cold-turkey evangelism. There is actually a documented movement in the late 60s and early 70s called the ' urlLink Jesus Movement ' where hundreds of thousand of people were saved.  There were all kinds of movements in the 60s and 70s that marked the very beginning of the postmodern movement we see in full fledge today. What was this revolution all about? What were they revolting against? There is a myriad amount of answers to these questions, but in short, it was against the sterile and traditional modern approach to life. People didnt want to wait until marriage to have sex, people didnt want to live in the block communities of suburban America, women didnt want to live in the home baking brownies, men didnt want to go to work eight hours a day in a suite and tie, and people didnt want to grow up having the same unspiritual life, going to a church affiliated with some irrelevant denomination.    A Little Philosophy   The type of revolution society was going through was the great earthquake the modernism, and it was no surprise. In fact it was foreseen by a philosopher named  urlLink Frederick Nietzsche . Nietzsche is best known for the atheistic aphorism, 'God is dead,' but not known for why he said such an offensive thing. His philosophy, in my opinion, sheds light on what exactly happened during the great philosophical earthquake of the 60 and 70s, and he has also had large influence on the postmodern thought of today. Let me state now, I go out on a limb with this thesis. I am not a philosophy major, nor do I have any ordained merit, but I find too much in common with Nietzsches ideas and our current state postmodernism.  Nietzsche was very influenced by the philosophy of nihilism.  urlLink Alan Pratt  defines it pretty well, 'Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence.' In my opinion Nietzsche wasnt a nihilist, but a victim of it, though he desperately tried to fight it. The encyclopedia also stated, 'Nietzsche argued that its [nihilisms] corrosive effects would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate the greatest crisis in human history.' Nietzsche agreed with Ludwig Feuerbachs teaching that God was merely a being postulated by projected human reflections ( urlLink Robert Solomon ). In other words; monotheism was created in the image of man.  urlLink Eugene Rose  comments, 'The type of god fashioned by men was not the omnipotent Creator of all revealed in the person of Jesus Christ,  the God who could raise the dead . On the contrary the fashioned god is a mere human idea, not revealed to faith and humility but constructed by the proud mind that still feels the need for 'explanation' when it has lost the desire for salvation. This is the dead god of the philosophers who only require a 'first cause' to complete their systems'  This type of reasoning made Nietzsche insists that there is no absolute foundation that can be known apart from our perspectives. He  urlLink writes , 'there are no facts, only interpretations.' Also, in  urlLink The Will to Power , he writes, 'That there is no truth; that there is no absolute state of affairsno thing-in-itself.  urlLink Eugene Rose  added, 'This alone is Nihilism of the most extreme kind.' Nietzsche despised anything that was dogmatic or claimed to have unassailable authority. He threw out the philosophy of metaphysics (the idea of true, transcendent being, i.e. God, absolutes), and instead brought forth an epistemology called 'perspectivism.'  Perspectivism teaches that the more perspectives one has, the closer to the truth one becomes. There are many perspectives. There is a religious perspective, a moral perspective, a scientific perspective, and an aesthetic perspective. A good example of perspectivism is in our poetic descriptions. It is better to say:    Her beauty is so captivating  That the very light she gently reflects  Is blessed beyond words  Before it can express her wonder To my eye     instead of saying, 'She weighs 107 pounds, has blond hair, blue eyes, and has such and such measurements.' The measurements may be a more descriptive and accurate way of describing the girl, but expresses little in how the beholder  relates  to her.  Nietzsches approach isnt entirely deconstructive. He goes forth his notorious, ' urlLink Will to Power ' philosophy which can best summarized by saying people act in accordance with there desire for value, esteem, worth, and strength. He encourages people to 'create themselves' like an artist would create artwork.  His philosophy is very experimental, individualistic, and revolutionary. It rejects all that is held true and valued, and seems to promise liberty through what is forbidden and contemptible; that is our own self-actualization.  Two postmodern philosophers, in particular, carried on the Nietzschean tradition.  urlLink Rorty  drops the notion of an absolute truth for his own ideas of  urlLink pragmatism .  A pragmatist has no absolute theory of truth but holds that our knowledge and beliefs help us cope and negotiate with reality. He advocates that the point behind any theory of truth is to help us decide what is good to believe. Rorty thinks his ideas of pragmatism covers him from the irrational position of relativism, but his views are marginalized by his own philosophy of liberal ironism. A liberal ironist is one who does not think his own ideas of his view of the world are right in that they correspond with some reality that is foundational. The ironist is committed to promoting a society in which there is a harmonious dialogue of our views with a growing circle of people. The irony, so to speak, is that Rorty can only believe and state that his view is better than others, but it is not necessarily true ( urlLink also see D.A. Carson ).   To the other postmodern philosopher,  urlLink Michel Foucault , truth is not something that is uncovered, but some thing that is fashioned by men. No one simply knows truth, but truth is known for something. This type of thinking can become very deconstructionist and aims to find the ulterior motive for power behind every theory of truth. Take todays politics for example. A political leader my state something true about the state of the nation, but it is written off by his opponents because the truth he is advocating is not for the truth itself, but for his agenda. Foucault follows Nietzsche in the Will to Power doctrine that one must become free from the indoctrination of what we are, and in turn, 'become oneself' to have value. He worked this method out in the arena of sexuality. He believed that there is no one way to understand or practice sex (he was gay), and all that is taught about sex is induced from a societal power struggle to contain mans inner freedom of sexual expression.17 Foucault died of AIDS in 1984 ( urlLink also see D.A. Carson ).   So What is Postmodernism?   Again,  urlLink Grenz  sheds light on this muddled goop by clarifying, 'Postmodern thinkers maintain that humans do not view the world from an objective vantage point but structure their world through the concepts they bring it.' In light of the ideas put forth by Nietzsche Rorty, and Foucault, we can construe three main tenets (or pillars) of postmodernism, and they work dialectically. First, we have nihilism; an indifference towards truth, a disintegration of value, and a vague sense purposelessness are at its root. Second, we have perspectivism; nothing can really be known in the absolute sense, yet truths still can be discerned for reasons relative to the given point of view. Third, we have the perfect product of the former two, pluralism. Pluralism is everyones friend in that it states that there are choices, choices are good, and no choice is superior to another. A classic example of such thinking came from the mouth of  urlLink Bishop Melvin Talbert  of the United Methodist Church when he responded to Larry King about his religious beliefs, 'I believe my God is large enough to be inclusive of all human beings who were created in God's image and that includes those religions that are not Christian.' He later added in response to a rebuttal, 'For me, salvation in Jesus Christ is the way, and what I try to do as a Christian is to live that example. My responsibility is not to convert all other religions, but to live the Christian faith in the face of those religions.  Are you going to say that my -- our friend on the show tonight who is Jewish is on the wrong path?  That's God's choice. That's God's judgment, not mine.' (Italics added for emphasis) That statement is the culmination of all three of these philosophies. Talbert is indifferent towards the traditional Christian belief that Jesus is the exclusive way to God, he speaks from his own perspective (i.e. the words 'For me'), and carefully includes all other 'ways' to God as being equally valid.  Tolerance is the single most important, if not absolute, virtue of postmodernism. Go back to my description of postmodernism being like a rainbow. No one color makes up the rainbow, but the diversity of colors. Diversity (not necessarily unity) is the highest value in the postmodern ethos. The more points of view we have, the better grasp we will have on truth. The more ideas that are included the more appealing the philosophy will be. The more ethnicity we have in society, the better the society will be.  The more inclusive the religion, the more spiritual it is. This is where people make the mistake of rushing to condemn postmodernism, when really what they are condemning is a consequence of it.  What postmodernism has at its heart is a critical agenda. It goes after whatever claims to have an infallible knowledge, even science. Science no longer has, or never had, adequate answers to questions as to Why are we here? Who are we? How shall we live? People want a deeper sense of truth than the facts, appearances, or even their own experiences. Things that were formally rejected, like religion, spirituality, mysticism, and 'other (eastern) religions,' are more accepted than ever, and whatever the ethnocentric mainstream was is rapidly waning.  urlLink Greg Boyd  sees the advantages of this:   At the same time, however, this postmodern perspective has served to expose the narrowness and arbitrariness of the Enlightenment assumption that reality can be exhaustively defined and understood by empirical categories. Postmodernism has been helpful in revealing the arrogance involved in the modern, Western, chronocentric, elitist, intellectual tendency to dismiss every other worldview that has ever existed as 'primitive' and 'superstitious.'   The playing field has been leveled.   Obviously, this is can be very confusing. Rationally speaking, people would not want a 'choice' when it comes to the absolute certainty of things. People dont want to be presented with a choice of different kinds of medicine that will ale their sicknesses, they want be presented with the right medicine that will cure them. But at the same time, however, people are in a state of nihilism. Nothing we choose really matters. What are we to do? In my view, people believe what they think matters. People want to be told the truth, they want meaning and significance, and they want to make a difference. They want something real, true, and authentic, but they find themselves unable to know if anything is real. Ironically, people find themselves in a constant crisis of faith; will they believe in what they think is real or will they doubt. If we only read our Bibles and paid attention to Paul when he says we live by faith, not by sight.   Response and Adaptation   Lets go back to the time of the 60and 70s and examine the Christian culture when my pastor came to Christ. At a leaders meeting, He retold the story of his upbringing in Christianity, the rejection of it, his conversion, and the fellowship he had with believers. His upbringing in a rural Baptist setting, where everyone knows each other, is typical of central Iowa. His rebellion against the church/religion was most likely inspired by the tremendous hypocrisy he saw in the lives of his family members and neighbors. After God got his attention through a number of unusual near-death experiences, he got involved with a group of Christians that called themselves the 'Jesus People'. He recalled the genuine love they had for each other, the relevant worship music, and their piously authentic ceremonies of baptism and breaking the bread. It was a group of people who were genuine in their beliefs and truly loved the Lord. This was a great example of a postmodern Christian experience.  Many people at the  urlLink Rock  experience the same things. You hear so many testimonies about an upbringing in a semi-Christian environment, disillusionment with religious people and the church, rebellion, repentance, and a new refreshing experience with people of the same age living in true communion with God. However, this is not something new or necessarily 'postmodern.'  urlLink Augustine  tells of a similar story of his conversion in the Confessions. Also Soren Kierkegaard, the father of the philosophy know as Existentialism, went through the same experience very dramatically.   Just before Nietzsche was born (1844),  urlLink Soren Kierkegaard  also saw the horrible effect modernism had on Christianity. Growing up in Denmark under the extremely strict religious education imposed on him by his father, Kierkegaard developed an absolute contempt for what he condescendingly called 'Christendom.' He didnt hate God, or the teachings of Christ, but what the church had become. In one of his more outrageous  urlLink journal entries , he writes, 'Christianity does not exist.' Also, in  urlLink The Attack upon Christendom , he also writes, 'New Testament Not True.' At first glance, he sounds heretical, but he develops a very funny sense of irony, poking fun at the complacency of his social eras lack of real faith. He would sarcastically comment about how in Denmark, 'everyone was a Christian', and on the wide path to heaven instead of the straight and narrow. No one was on the wide path to destruction, for how could they be? The Danish church was a state church that you were born into; you were born Christian. You would go to church and the priest would lecture about faith and the sacraments and that would make you a better Christian. Kierkegaard hated this. He developed a deep contempt for this superficiality and went through his own time of empty rebellion while he was in college. However, he became extremely depressed and found little solace in the wild social life he partook in. He turned incredibly inward, and in his profound inwardness he became intensely individualistic and reflected much on why he existed and for what existence he had to live for himself. Hence, he became the founding figure of existentialism. In this mode of thought, he became conscious of certain absolute truths that he had to make choices about, and how he related to them. (see  urlLink Phillip Cary )  The first truth he had to face is that we must make a choice. Second, each person, as an individual, must choose between God and the world. An atheist does this, as well as a Christian. He writes, 'This is the eternal, unchangeable condition of choice that can never be evadedno, never in all eternity.' To Kierkegaard, even if a postmodern pluralist were to say, 'God and the World arent absolutely different,' this would be refraining from choosing, and thus be a choice. Kierkegaard teaches that either every man must present himself before God, or live mundanely in the pettiness of bourgeois society. The third truth that Kierkegaard expounds is that, 'God has been merciful to us, demonstrating his grace to the point of being willing to involve himself with every person.' What Kierkegaard is so passionate about is having a living, breathing, and personal relationship with God. ( urlLink Quoted from this )  Kierkegaard brought the 'personal relationship with God' theology to a much higher and more personal (or existential) level. Kierkegaard never set out to prove the existence of God; in fact the thought the idea of proving Gods existence was foolish. It would be like a court of law trying to prove a criminal existed, instead of proving that the accused, who does exist, is a criminal. Why would you try to reason in conclusion to existence, instead of reasoning from existence to conclusion ( urlLink Quoted from this )? Kierkegaards entire philosophical project is to make faith difficult, like the faith demonstrated by Abrahams sacrifice of Isaac. Kierkegaard called this the 'Leap of Faith' and for him, faith is how we come to know things for certain.  Kierkegaard disliked 'objective truth.' He felt it was meaningless to existence, and would have no bearing on how people lived if it was known. He boldly proclaims the absolute truth of Christ and how little it mattered to the people standing right in front of him, Pilate asked, 'What is truth?' And with such a question, it was crucified. Kierkegaard was more interested in what he calls 'subjective truth.' Now this is where it gets confusing. This sort of truth is characterized by how it relates to the absolute truth. The straight and narrow road is not a literal road, but how the journey is lived ( urlLink Quoted from this ). This is the most important kind of truth for Kierkegaard. The following quote sounds very postmodern, and is the most direct statement about what he means:   Truth is not a sum of statements, not a definition, not a system of concepts, but a life. Truth is not a property of thought that guarantees validity to thinking. No, truth in its most essential character is the reduplication of truth within yourself, within me, within him. Your life, my life, his life express the truth in the striving. Just as the truth was a life in Christ, so too, for us truth must be lived. ( urlLink Edifying Discourses )   Reduplication means to live out in life the challenges of what one thinks, to be what one says. Kierkegaard had a problem though. How could he to communicate this truth to people without it becoming marginalized by the chronocentric modern method of intellectual categorization? He desperately did not want to be another footnote of consciousness, for thats what happened when people wrote books about truth. He felt that subjective truth was too deep and to insightful to be communicated directly. So he turned to what he calls 'indirect communication.' He wrote long-winded novels and discourses under pseudonyms (false names) to offer multiple perspectives filled with philosophical irony about the relation they all had to truth. This all seems nauseatingly complex, but a man who communicated his 'subjective truth' very well, inspires Kierkegaard ( urlLink Palmer ).   Jesus never proved he was the Son of God to those who demanded proof. Jesus simply put forth his teachings, his character, his miracles, and implored his followers to have faith in him. Comically, when Jesus was asked about what the kingdom of God was like, he would say it was about, 'a man who sowed good seed in his field,' 'a mustard seed', 'like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour', 'a treasure in a field,' 'a merchant looking for fine pearls,' and 'like the owner of a house.' He rarely ever said what he meant, but by doing so, caused people to come out of the complacent lull they had drowsily fallen into by listening to the teachers of the law. Jesus caused the people to think and relate to the parables that he often gave without explanation.  Communication is the challenge of postmodern evangelism. It is all based on the method of language in which we present the truth. I remember my pastor sharing about his experiences of living and evangelizing in Boulder, Colorado. Armed with his Bible and the fire of Christs message burning in his heart, he boldly proclaimed the Gospel. However, he quickly found out that sharing the Four Spiritual Laws with people was ineffective in bringing people to Christ. He was not alone in his experience, and a new method had to be developed to communicate the time-old truths of the Gospel. Hanging out at the arcade playing pinball sharing with onlookers, he told of the awesome changes Christ made in his life. My pastors mantra 'Experience God, not Religion' was born, and it is a concise synopsis of what Kierkegaard emphatically tried to say through his bizarre, cryptic style.   The church has had large fear of postmodernism, because it seems as though all truth must be discarded and everything must be approached nonrationally. Leonard Sweet in  urlLink Postmodern Pilgrims  teaches that Churches must become 'E.P.I.C.' (experimental, participating, image based, connected communities) in order to communicate the truths of Christ. This is a helpful acronym to keep in mind; however, in my view, this is a narrow treatment of postmodernism because postmodernism still includes rational approaches to knowing truth. Many postmodern evangelists think postmoderns have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. They have not. Rational approaches of knowledge are just another one of the perspectives used to find out if something is true. The best rational evangelistic tool that challenges informal pluralism is the teachings found in Josh McDowells  urlLink More Than a Carpenter . Either Jesus is the way, or he is not.   However, postmodern people do not want another argument proving Christianity. They would rather see a Christian living by what he says, rather than listening to what he says. A bold Christian life is no longer about standing up with a microphone blathering on about the virtues of purity, but actually living pure in the midst the peer pressure of immorality. Postmoderns would rather see a life changed and lived with conviction, than hear about why it is good to be changed. People want to experience God spiritually, not mentally. One of biggest movements that the church has ever witnessed is the wild fire spread of Pentecostalism. In the last 30 years no other movement has even come close to the record growth it has seen32. In the past, it was labeled 'cultic' and 'flaky' for its unorthodox practices, but many Christians, desiring to experience true spiritual power, have experimented with it. People, like my own parents and many Rockers, have moved on to a Pentecostal denomination in search of a more intimate spiritual experience.  Postmoderns want to be active in their beliefs. It is important for the Church to allow people to participate in ministry, leadership, theological dialogue, and even the messages, so their beliefs can be relevant to their lives. People want to be participants in the body of Christ, to have a role, and a purpose, instead of being a simple observer. All of this calls Christians to take their faith more seriously.   Postmoderns are moved by images as well as words. Movie clips illustrate feelings, and other nonrational concepts in ways never before imagined. The movie The Matrix inspired deep reflection on faith, reality, and religion. It gave a great working picture of the modern philosophy of Descartes, and the struggle between knowing what is real and what is not. Mark did a superb job using The Shawshank Redemption to illustrate hope. The pictures can say things that statistics never could, but that doesnt mean that you replace black and white text for pictures, otherwise you run the risk of dumbing down everything you say. A popular conjunction of these two methods is in John Eldridges book Wild at Heart. He uses both pictures from movies and his own words to clearly communicate his ideas.  Postmoderns long to have community. It is ironic that in an intensely individualistic culture, where we all are trying to become ourselves, we long to be connected to each other. In a support letter I received from a campus missionary commenting on the variety of reality love shows (Joe Millionaire, the Bachelor), he wrote, 'We just cant seem to get enough love stories! It seems that our society is relationally deprived.' If there is one thing that determines peoples acceptance or rejection of Christianity, it is by how they are received within the Christian community. Will they be welcomed and accepted, or ignored and snubbed?   As far as I am concerned, the Rock is doing an excellent job allowing its members to experience and participate in the authentic spiritual life communicated by its leaders. The use of stories, images, participation, and a sincere community has fostered the growth of hundreds of lives. Some things to grow in, however, would be a greater emphasis on worship and bible teaching. Remember, modern Christianity became superficial; postmoderns will not tolerate superficiality in any way. A perfect example of this genuine hunger was articulated by a small group leaders comments at the last leaders meeting, 'In this year of leading small group, I have never had to teach from the Word as much as I have this year. People are hungry for truth the Bible teaches, but they arent sure how to understand it.  It has been a pleasure for me to write this. I could go on longer about what we can do to reach out to postmoderns, but that was not the focus of this essay. The purpose I had in writing this essay was to help people love God with all their mind, as well as our heart, soul, and strength. Also it must be said that postmodernism is in its infant stages and is always changing, and that is why philosophers are cautious to define it. Nevertheless, we have an enormous opportunity to relate with our culture, and I am excited to be a part of a movement dedicated to making Jesus Christ attractive to the outside world.

"             Deswarmination  Screenplay by Glenn Karlsen    Cast of Characters:  Disclaimer: Any similarity between people and events in this work of fiction and actual people and events is purely coincidental and if you disagree then you probably suffer from some staggering egotism issues. I mean honestly, everything isn’t always about you.  The Ladies of Swarm:  Cindy Chan “TMTDB”: When Cindy says “Throw me the disk, bitch!”, bitches throw her the disk. Cindy is a levelheaded, sweet woman off the field but on the field she’s a hellcat who refuses to be looked off. There is nary a Swarmer who hasn’t felt the searing heat of the “C. Chan Scowl”.  Cindy Ong “Slash”: Is her nickname because her cuts have been studied by F1 engineers in hopes of improving the performance of their racing machines or is it because there is widespread speculation concerning why she always declines to accompany the Swarm on their post-game drinking binges on nights with a full moon. Is she a mild mannered Swarmer or is she a bloodthirsty werewolf?  Lindsay “The Schoolmistress”: Beneath the façade of her pleasant disposition lays the smoldering heart of a genuinely benevolent soul. But just to the left and down a little of from that heart lays the spleen of a petulant six year old. Fortunately for all, the spleen is a very low ranking organ and is only allowed to call the shots (at least the verbal shots) while behind the wheel of a two thousand pound automobile and of course that other time, but we have all decided to forget about that.  Lisa Personality #1: “The Barbarian”: Having played Ultimate for nigh on four hundred years there is nothing that Lisa doesn’t know about the game and nothing she won’t do to win. She rails against those less competitive than herself and those who fail to appreciate her balls-tothe-wall playing style.  Personality #2: “Oprah”: Lisa wants everyone to enjoy the game and will do whatever she can to ensure harmony and contentment on the field. Always quick with a complement, Lisa wants you to be the best Ultimate player you can be.  Mel “The Siren”: Sings like an angel, runs like a gazelle. Mel is able to run at full speed, circling the handler for hours on end without tiring, all the time playing the guitar and belting out “I said I” and “Five minutes after the call”,available for sale at:  urlLink http://www.melaniedekker.com/   Verlane “Cap’n Smiley Crotch”: Don’t let her curly, red hair fool you, this girl is no Shirley Temple, she’s a Strawberry Daiquiri and make that a double. When she’s patrolling the field she’ll take no guff from anyone. If you’ve got guff, you’d best keep it to yourself or dispose of it elsewhere.  The Gentlemen of Swarm: Alfred “The mercenary”: Exhausted from a full day of Ultimate-for-hire he showed up to bolster the depleted Swarm line-up after some undisclosed “persuasion” from Verlane.  Geoffrey C “A-game, S-game”: Bemused savant with devastating good-looks (see: http://www3.telus.net/nutmilk/Swarm 2004/GPC2.jpg) who, when he brings his stellar Ultimate A-game is the ultimate in unstoppable Ultimate forces but when he brings his S-game………Ultimately, which game will he bring today?  Geoffrey L “Lifestyle guy”: Granola Hemp Hippy turned Tri-athlete Tax Lawyer soon to be turned Snooty, Riche Pants, Oxford Master of Laws. His body sacrificing layout-or-die defense is surpassed only by his ability to fire off writs and torts and argue the minutia of the penal code while delivering “Loomer Laser” passes to the dump.  Glenn “Grumpdaddy”: Among Glenn’s weekly contribution to the team is bringing two very comfy chairs. His best four weeks were when he managed to occupy one of the chairs for the entire duration of each and every game. When Glenn isn’t grumping it up on the field or the sidelines he’s usually at work writing long, incomprehensible, unsolicited email in order to help fill his fellow Swarmer’s trash bins.  King: “New Guy”: King is a long time Ultimater, first time Swarmer. King’s unconventional how-about-we-try-and-win attitude and his propensity both for catching disks thrown to him and throwing disks where other Swarmers could catch them have been labeled “Unswarmish”, a stigma he’s still learning to deal with.  Paul: “DVD”: If you met him on the field you’d think he’s called DVD for his Defense, Vitality & Determination. Actually it’s for his stellar string of straight to DVD blockbusters such as Mindstorm, The Operative, Escape Velocity and the upcoming Crash Landing (see http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083590). When Paul isn’t tearing up the field in his patented “no traction” cleats he’s in front of his computer “making marvelous movie magic, man!”  Peter “The Rookie”: International melon magnate on the run from the Brazilian mango mob Peter has a highly refined strategic mind and a set of hands that would make an NFL receiver turn green with envy. His adept brain is always three steps ahead; his burly body is oft playing catch up.  The Capricious Gods:  Wendell “God of Loose Connections”: The god who is to blame when wires don’t quite meet, when connectors aren’t snug and when the plug doesn’t exactly fit into the socket. Wendell is a spiteful dweeb who can only be appeased through ritual sacrifice, please see page #42728 of “How to Placate the Modern Techno Gods” revised 2003.  Susie “God of Servers Being Down”: Part malevolent destroyer, part random menace, part creator of free time, this god is a big ol’ hunk of cheese in the office’s intestinal tract. Susie is more an arbiter of pleadings & prayer than a receiver of sacrifice. For more details see Chapter 72 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  Angus Longshaft “God of Cable Loss”: God to blame when the cable you absolutely, positively must have just isn’t to be found. Angus is a very ancient god and isn’t exactly the brightest light in the pantheon. All supplications to Angus involve a fair bit of prostration, a kilt, and a skillfully placed haggis (sort of explains the popularity of wireless technology, no?), see Chapter 162 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  The Folks Watching it on TV:  Stan &amp; Nancy Vul “Stan & Nancy or The Vuls”: A nice middle-aged couple watching TV, you probably know someone just like them.  ANGUS LONGSHAFT BACK STORY: The year was 1127 the place was somewhere north of Glasgow and somewhere south of the Norwegian Sea, more specifically a small town in the highlands called Glennglennic. In this town lived a man, a large man, a towering behemoth of a man. This man’s name was Angus Longshaft and what Angus could do better than anyone else in the history of history was throw a 20ft toothpick for distance. So dominant was Angus’ caber tossing ability that he had never, in his short but distinguished history, been beaten.  On a fine day in June it was time, once again, for the Huge Highland Games. The event kicked off with the usual pretty girls dancing around swords for reasons that were a bit sketchy even then. Next followed a few lads smacking each other about the head and neck with claymores followed by a round or two of the ever-popular Highland Leapfrog. With all of the preliminaries events out of the way it was time for the main event, the crowd pleaser, the Caber Toss.  Angus, being the reigning champion, was scheduled to throw last so he sat back comfortably, scratched, drank mead, and pursued his other avenue of interest - chatting up the bonnie lasses. There were many fine competitors on this day but none came close to reaching Angus’ previous years record of two spins, and 35ft. In the final round it came down to two competitors: Angus and Rogered Patterson (so named for an unfortunate incident during a hotly contested game of Highland Leapfrog – but that’s an entirely different story). Angus threw his final caber and achieved a remarkable throw of 2.25 revolutions, 41ft. Rogered knew he was going to lose and started to sweat (he’d wagered a cask of his best whiskey that he’d win) and sweat. In fact folks were heard to say “Wow, sweaty Rogered Patterson sure is sweaty, even for him.”  Rogered waddled up to the line with his caber balanced precariously on his shoulder and his unfortunately slick palms. Off to the left Angus was putting the moves on the young lass who, though she didn’t win, had bounced her way through the sword dance competition in the most delightful way. Rogered reared back and tossed the caber like he’d never tossed a caber before – exceptionally poorly. In fact the caber slid off Rogered’s perspiration soaked mitts and careened up and to the left, up and to the left, landing directly on the back of Angus’ head. The force of the impact drove Angus face-first onto the anvil he’d been leaning against and then spilled the contents of his cranium onto the skirt of the aforementioned lass.  Now really this was a grave injustice. No champion should go out this way. It was uncool. Kenny “The God of the Despicable Demise” noticed this abomination and decided to do what he could to rectify it. He went before the Council for the Creation of New Gods and Lipstick Colours and argued that Angus represented the epitome of Caber Tossing prowess and as the Caber was growing in popularity as something to toss – having recently passed both the boulder and the cat in the latest poll by “Things to Toss Quarterly” magazine. The Council pondered this argument and then the Chairwoman asked “So, Angus Longshaft…? How long?”  Long years passed with Angus reigning supreme in all things Caber Toss related.  Even longer years passed and at a certain point the number of people tossing the Caber began to slowly decline. It wasn’t as if people suddenly one day said “I shan’t pick up that 150lb stick anymore” it was more that the young folk weren’t as likely to fling the broom (as everyone knows, the first step on the road to caber toss) and there were a lot more bridges around so the need to chuck a log across a stream just didn’t come up as much.  Frankly Angus didn’t really notice the waning of his godly area of influence, he wasn’t that big on noticing what was going on anywhere. Angus had only two interests: Caber Toss and enjoying the bonny lasses; he was spectacularily talented at both endeavors. In fact all the goddesses, from time to time, would pay a call on Angus to “get things sorted” and because of this, among the gods, he earned a reputation (completely unjustifiably I might add, but you know how it is when you hear people repeating the same thing for six or seven centuries, eventually you just assume that its true) as someone who could sort things out. Apparently the gods don’t understand what a euphemism is.  The year is now 2004 and Caber Toss is suffering yet another year in what has been centuries of decline. The Godly Director of Observances, Supplications, Prayers, Pleadings & Sacrifice is doing her quarterly tabulation of the books and discovers that Caber Toss is no longer viable. Normally this would mean that Angus (as the deity in this area) would be cast out of Godland to be eaten by the crows and other angry forest creatures in the Forest of Angry Forest Creatures that surrounds Godland. But, Deloris thought back to all the evenings that Angus had helped her get things sorted and decided that Angus was just too valuable to let go. Instead she wrote out a pink slip for Angus and made an appointment for him to speak with the employment counselor and handed it to Mercury. After Angus finished his morning two-hour Caber practice Mercury handed him the pink slip.  Angus asked him, “So, what the hell is this then?”.  Mercury replied, “It’s a pink slip dude…you’ve been laid off.”  Angus looked at him, the light of comprehension decidedly absent from his eye. “So Deloris is handing out pink slips afterwards now is she? I mean I admit our last time wasn’t my best performance but…but I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with this” eyeing the note suspiciously.  “No Angus. The note is informing you that you are no longer the God of Caber Toss. You’ve been sacked.” Mercury informed him. “You have to go and talk to Simon over at the Employment Center.” With that Mercury decided that he was needed elsewhere and flew off before the confused Scottish god with the big stick decided to take out his frustrations on a certain winged, bearer of bad news.  Angus still had no idea what Mercury had been on about but he thought that maybe that new fellow Simon could explain it to him – Angus had been meaning to get over and talk to him to see if he’d be interested in tossing the Caber about.  Angus walked into the Employment Center and found Simon’s office. Simon looked up and asked what he could do for him. Angus said that he’d had a visit from Mercury, some kind of pink paper from Deloris and he thought he’d come by and chat with Simon about it. Simon asked if he could see the paper and after examining it started to flip through his gigantic ledger (because gods only ever read from giant books) and found the available position section. He then asked Angus what his interests were, he said “So Angus, what are your interests, what are you good at?”.  Angus realized that he’d finally found someone he could talk to and belted out in his proudest, thickest Scottish brogue “Well Simon, I like f#%&amp;ing and Caber Toss”.  Simon, being a simple god, was so taken aback by Angus’ reply that he blushed bright pink and didn’t take the time to get Angus to repeat the last bit that he’d only half heard. He eventually managed to say, “Well I believe that Aphrodite and Eros have got that one area covered…so, lets see about the other.”  Angus wondered if that meant that Simon was interested in a bit o’ the toss. He sat expectantly and waited while Simon flipped through his big book.  Eventually Simon stopped flipping, believing he had found something appropriate, in fact it seemed to be the exact thing that Angus wanted “God of Cable Loss” by all accounts it seemed to even be in an area of serious growth. Simon looked up and said, “Well Angus, I think I’ve found just the thing for you…Cable Loss”  Angus realized at that moment that Simon was probably a bit of an idiot but at least he was into the toss, even if he pronounced it a bit oddly. He responded with “Yeah, Caber Toss, care to go fling a few?”  Simon, confirming his previous assumption that Angus was a dolt-in-gods-clothing, smiled, nodded at the man and said “Sure, maybe later. Here’s your Techno God Guild card, your new Tome of Responsibilities and Privileges (colloquially known as the TORAP, think of it as the Idiot’s Guide to being the God of X, where in this case, unbeknownst to Angus, X is Cable Loss), and the keys to your new place in the new Techno neighbourhood. Menial and Tedious will look after moving your things for you. Best of luck to you!” then he extended his hand in hopes of accelerating Angus’ progress towards the door.  Angus was nonplussed (he didn’t know the he was nonplussed, he was under the mistaken impression that his condition could be most accurately described as flummoxed but I’m telling you that he was definitely nonplussed). His day had started normally but had gone strangely since then. But, on the upside, he was holding the keys to a new house and that was good because the old place was getting a bit beaten up - what with the occasional Caber-through-the-wall accident and all. Angus gathered his thoughts, an action of scant milliseconds, and uttered, “Well nice to meet you Simon, thanks for the house, we’ll get together for that toss and maybe grab some pie as well”, because he found that people always felt better at the mere mention of pie, and he set off to find this new house of his.  GETTING CLOSER TO THE SWARM-RELATED BIT OF THE STORY:  Angus found his house, across the street from the houses of Wendell – God of Loose Connections and Susie – Goddess of Servers Being Down, who were newly anointed gods and were also moving in. The three gods introduced themselves and the two newbies were excited to learn how long Angus had been reigning in Godland. They assumed, a mistake that would taint the first three or four decades of their reigns but we’ll get to that later, that Angus would be an excellent source of information on all things godly and god related. They chatted for a while and then Wendell said that he had to go home and start reading his TORAP.  “TORAP? Nooooo, you two must come on over and we’ll lift a few pints. There’s plenty of time for reading tomorrow, or next week, maybe next month, next year, in a hundred years…”, Angus said as he tried to coax his new friends back to the full service bar in his new home (all god homes have a full service bar – the god’s architect got mentally blocked in 1970’s American suburbia.)  Wendell and Susie spent the next four hours listening to Angus tell them Caber Toss stories. Luckily they were still so starry eyed at having become gods that they didn’t realize that Angus was boring the living snot out of them. Eventually Angus got tired of talking and realizing that it was time for his afternoon practice. He tried to convince his new friends to come with him for some log lobbing but they both declined saying that they had to settle into their new places.  Over the next few days Susie and Wendell met more of their fellow gods and heard, repeatedly, how lucky they were to have someone as good at getting things sorted as Angus for a neighbour - though Susie still hadn’t figured out why the other goddesses always said it with a wink and a nod. Susie also discovered, much to her chagrin, that Wendell appeared to be a morning person who was prone to start collecting his ritual offerings (a process that is much too disgusting to describe here but if you’ve ever seen a grown man run for the phone and stub his toe on the coffee table causing him to hop in pain, loose his balance on the hardwood floor, and then carom crotch first into the banister then you at least have some idea what it sounds like, only imagine it about forty-three times louder) at six in the morning. Susie, on the other hand, enjoyed staying up late into the night blasting the prayers and pleadings of her devotees on her zillion watt stereo not heading to bed until Apollo had stumbled out of the shower and had his morning coffee – of course Apollo was at his own home across town in the old Greek neighbourhood (imagine street after street of the Parthenon only no rubble) but you know what I’m getting at.  This clash of sleeping habits led to a bit of enmity between the Goddess of Servers Being Down and the God of Loose Connections. Relations across the picket fence became frosty. When Susie needed eggs one day, Wendell claimed to be fresh out. When Wendell popped over in hopes of replenishing his depleted salsa stocks during the Superbowl (yes, even the gods watch sports on TV), Susie said she couldn’t spare any. If you’re wondering why gods and goddesses are running out of groceries its because neither of them had got around to reading their TORAP yet (Angus’ illiterate influence, plus they really are intimidatingly large books) and they weren’t aware that a river of salsa was only a finger snap away. Anyway, as sleeplessness continued to take its toll Wendell began to describe his neighbour as “the shrew next door” and Susie spitefully referred to Wendell as “that screaming ass”.  One Wednesday morning as Angus was about to head out to practice Wendell intercepted him and described his problem with the goddess next door in hopes that he could benefit from Angus’ renowned talent for sorting things out.  Angus was, of course, oblivious to this build-up of tension in the neighbourhood but he pondered the problem for a minute and then said, “what always works for me when dealing with an unhappy goddess is to invite her over, give her a glass or two of wine, play some sexy bagpipe music on the stereo, dim the lights, rub her shoulders for a while, and then…well…you know.” Wendell was disgusted by the very idea.  Angus then suggested that Wendell could come with him to give the caber a bit of a go and they could come up with a solution. Wendell managed to wriggle out of having to try and heave a tree across a field but still got Angus to commit to coming up with a solution to his goddess problem. Angus trotted off and promptly forgot all about poor Wendell.  On Angus’ return from practice Susie stopped him and told him about all the problems she was having with Wendell. Angus immediately proposed his wine, bagpipes, shoulder rub solution but Susie rejected it even faster than Wendell had. Angus then advocated a Caber Toss – the loser of which would have to move into Angus’ old house (as Angus dimly recalled hearing through the goddess grapevine – they always wanted to talk afterward… - that his old house was still unoccupied due to all the caber damage). Susie wasn’t crazy about the caber aspect but did relish the idea of crushing Wendell in a competition and being rid of him. Susie then said, and if she’d only known then what she knows now she never would have, “Well Angus, I don’t have any idea how gods handle this sort of thing but I’ll go for any sort of godlike, goddish, godly contest to decide this thing. I’ll leave it in your capable hands to sort out.” Susie then gave Angus her best smile and sashayed on home. Angus watched her walk away and had several thoughts, none of which had anything to do with caber toss.  It occurred to Angus that he’d heard countless times that he knew how to sort things out and that this was an occasion where being able to sort things out would definitely be an asset. So, he just needed to sort this out. Angus went inside and sat down in his favourite chair. He then kicked his feet up on his favourite wooly footstool and began to think. His first idea was that Wendell and Susie should just…but no, neither of them was willing to give that a try. His next idea…no Susie said no caber.  His third idea was to turn on the TV and see if the Highland Games were on. After flipping through 900 channels he finally found one showing the 1983 games from Inverness and he settled back in his chair to think. Eleven hours later Angus hadn’t moved from his chair (gods don’t pee) but he was still waiting for idea number four. Finally at 3am he gave up attempting to come up with an idea on his own and decided that he’d ask someone. So, having solved how he would solve the problem he went to bed.  Thursday morning he got up and, as per his routine for the past nine hundred years, he had some porridge and headed off to practice. And, as had been his routine since yesterday, an exhausted Wendell accosted him. “Aye, Wendell, I’ve got a solution for you. I just need to work out a few kinks and I’ll have it for you tomorrow. Just leave me to sort it all out.” Wendell was so ecstatic that Angus was going to tame the wicked wench for him that he almost forgot himself and agreed to throw the twig with him. Instead he scurried back inside and performed an stunning rendition of the Myposian dance of joy.  After practice Angus ran into Diana who’d had a frustrating morning – only scratches and sweat to show for three hours chasing an elusive hind through the forest. A few hours later Angus was laying on a bearskin rug, basking in the afterglow, half-listening to Diana describe, in excruciating detail, a dispute she’d had with Fanny - Goddess of the Henhouse. As Angus contemplated attempting another go, something in what Diana said coaxed another thought to the surface.  “So, you settled your problem using mortals?” was the thought that Angus managed to express.  “Of course, it’s Rule #3 in every TORAP ‘All disputes between the good gods and goddesses of Godland shall be decided by contest between mortals.’ ” Diana said and then after a strategic glance nether-wards realized that Angus wasn’t using his big brain currently and there really were more pressing issues than talking about the TORAP.  After sorting the pressing issues and a bit more basking Angus headed home to solve Wendell and Susie’s problem once and for all. He settled into his chair and thought “Mortal competition…mortal competition” over and over. It then occurred to him that beside caber toss he had no idea what mortals were up to these days. In fact, he hadn’t had any contact with the mortal world at all besides watching Highland games on TV and that one fellow who’d prayed to him two years ago. “What was the fellows name again? Stamp, Stain, Dido, no…Stan, that was it.” Angus fondly remembered Stan, who’d taken his wife – Nancy if memory served – on a trip to Scotland and had decided that when in Scotland you must toss a caber. Angus briefly forgot about everything as he relived the moment when Stan had held the caber wobbling up off the ground and had started praying with a vengeance “Oh god don’t let this oversized chopstick crush me into the ground, oh please, don’t let my back give out, oh let me just get this one toss so I can tell the grandkids I did it!” Fortunately for Stan, Angus had heard his prayers and had helped Stan’s back hold out. And, in a further bit of good luck Scotland has an excellent medical system and your pinky toe really isn’t as important as everyone makes it out to be. Additionally, the cast had impressed the grandchildren even more than the piece of paper with, “This certifies that on the 3rd of July, 2002 Stan Vul of Quallicum Beach threw the Caber a total of 0 revolutions, 3 inches distance.” written on it.  Angus took a moment to gather his thought and then decided that he’d just take a peek and see what Stan was up to and maybe that would give him a clue as to what kind of mortal competition was going on these days.  STAN AND NANCY VUL: Stan and Nancy live in Quallicum Beach, which, as the name may lead you to believe, is situated right where the majestic, temperate rainforest meets the cool waters of the Juan de Fuca Straight. Quallicum Beach is the kind of place you pass through and think that it might be nice to come back and visit when you needed to get away from it all. It’s the kind of place where you imagine you wouldn’t be hassled by having to ‘do things’ or worry about anything ‘happening’. It’s the kind of place where everyone has a satellite dish that pipes pseudo-life into their homes via the 5700-channel television universe.  The Vuls have set aside this particular evening to watch ESPN 17’s Thursday Night Ultimate Doubleheader. Many of Stan and Nancy’s neighbours think that they are nutty for watching Thursday Ultimate when it is generally acknowledged that it is the weakest night but Stan and Nancy swear by the entertainment value to be found on Thursday. And tonight was doubly good because both of their favourite teams were playing – not each other, but that would be next week.  Stan’s favourite team is the Swarm, a rag-tag group who’s season thus far has consisted of a five game winning streak that saw them boosted into the First Division, followed by a nine game losing streak that saw them relegated back to Second Division. One of the things that Stan liked best about them was that on any given week there’s no telling which team will show up, the dominating force or the godforsaken nightmare, they always kept you on the edge of your seat. Stan also liked that it was fun to try and figure out how different members of the team were connected to each other, it was like playing that Kevin Bacon game, with all of the Swarm being connected somehow – school, work, other sports, relationships, but the overall connection was pretty loose. The final thing about the Swarm that Stan appreciated was that they weren’t a team that got all caught up in the whole “Spirit of the Game” non-sense, in fact they’d almost come to blows in one game which had had Stan up cheering until the game had been called on account of hard feelings.  Nancy, on the other hand, like a team called Wham-O. They weren’t as spectacular as the Swarm could be at it’s best but they were solid and courteous and those were the things that Nancy appreciated. She also liked that all the players on Wham-O were waiters and waitresses, people who had jobs she could understand, not like those Swarm with their Melon magnates, show business folk, and high-tech phone weirdoes. Nancy was born in Quallicum Beach and aside from that disastrous trip to Scotland hadn’t left.  As the first game got underway Nancy began her usual torrent of mockery for Stan’s beloved Swarm. “So, I see your big fellow is doing his job keeping that chair from blowing away in the wind.”  “Yes Nancy, he’s still on the DL but the doctor’s say he’ll be ready to play next week. All right!! Did you see Pete catch that one in the endzone? We’re up! BZZZZ! Go Swarm!!” Stan replied as he leapt to his feet in celebration.  The game was a seesaw battle back and forth with the Swarm getting to the dreaded eight-point-wall first.  AND THIS IS WHERE ANGUS STARTS PEEKING IN:  “My team of loose connections is kicking some serious Ultimate butt now Nancy. Swarm rules! Yeah Swarm! Oh…domination!”  Angus heard this and couldn’t believe his good fortune – but then he thought about it and realized that Stephanie (Goddess of Unexpected Good Fortune) really did owe him one after last Saturday. Here he’d been looking for a mortal competition and Stan and Nancy had provided one – granted it looked like a bunch of people running around a field with a broken fly-swatter but if that’s what the mortals were into these days then that was fine with him. And double bonus, Wendell God of Loose Connections already had a team here, the Swarm! Angus decided to revel in his success for a few minutes and in doing so he completely missed the end of the game, but no matter, all he had to do now was find a team for Susie and he was set.  By this time the second game was underway and Stan had taken over the mocking duties. On one play the handler for Wham-O ran for a disk and somehow managed to trip himself and sprawled onto the grass as the disk flew through the space where his hands had been only milliseconds before. Stan burst out “We’ve got a waiter down! Waiter down, Nancy!” with a giggle.  Nancy indignantly replied, “They’re called servers now Stanly, Martha says that you have to call them servers”.  Stan laughed all the louder as he yelled out “Server down! Nancy, we’ve got a server down!” in his best Scottish accent. This time Angus took having the solution to his problem handed to him in stride – after all he wasn’t well know as a man who could sort things out for nothing – and wrote “Wham-O for Susie” in his mental notebook. Now the only problem was arranging for Swarm to play Wham-O.  Now, one of the real treats in being a god is that arranging things for mortals is right up their alley, it’s kind of what they do. That is, gods who’ve read the TORAP, which, as I’m sure you’ve realized by now, Angus has not done.  So, Angus tried to figure out a way that he could get the two teams to play each other…nothing came to mind. Then he had a brainstorm, maybe he could get someone else to arrange it for him, it seemed like all his goddess friends were always on about how they had to arrange this or that thing all the time. Just as he was about to stop peeking and start looking for help he heard the announcer rap up the broadcast by saying “And tune in next Thursday when you’ll see Swarm vs. Wham-O and the Belligerent Buddha’s vs. the Dawdling Sherpas.”  At that point he stopped his peeking in on the Vuls and headed over to tell Wendell and Susie that he’d arranged for their competition next Thursday night.  He stood out on the sidewalk and bellowed for his neighbors to come out and hear the exciting news. Wendell and Susie wandered outside expending great energy to give the impression that they were effortlessly ignoring each other. Angus explained, “There’s going to be an Ultimate game next Thursday to decide this problem the two of you are having.” Angus would have gone into greater detail on the problem but he’d completely forgotten what the problem was, what with all the thinking he’d had to do to solve it – there’s only so much room in a man’s brain.  Angus continued, “Susie, you’re team is Wham-O and Wendell the Swarm will play for you. Whoever’s team loses has to move to my old house on… well… over that-a-way,” he said with a vague wave nowhere near the direction of his former domicile. “So, now that that’s settled, who’s up for a…” but before he could get his chronic question out, Wendell and Susie both erupted with questions of their own, questions such as, “What are the rules? Who is Swarm? When on Thursday? Where is the game? What is Ultimate?”  Angus replied with, “The rules…whoever wins, wins. Swarm is Wendell’s team, weren’t you listening? The game is on TV. It’s a mortal game where they run around, count to ten, stand around a lot, and try to hit each other in the head with a flying plate.”  With that Susie and Wendell threw petulant scowls across the fence at each other for a few seconds and then withdrew to ponder their upcoming competition. Angus stood for a few minutes thinking that maybe he should try working on getting a reputation as a ladies-man and leave this “sorting things out” to someone else. He glanced down at his CaberMan Timex and judged that it was probably a good time to get in some practice and headed off to, well, you know.  AT SUSIE’S: Susie walked back inside seething from having that screaming ass scowl at her. She wound up and booted the first thing she saw in her foyer and her TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome she bent down and looked at what the open page said, “Messing with Mortals for Fun & Profit” was the title of the chapter. Susie sat down, flipped to the front of the book and began to read.  All through the night and well into the next afternoon exclamations such as, “You’re kidding me! That’s all I had to do?! Oh my me!” could be heard emanating from her foyer.  AT WENDEL’S: Wendell walked back inside seething from having that shrew scowl at him. He wound up and booted the first thing he saw in his foyer and his TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome he wound up and booted it again, and again, and again until it ended up in the closet. He then limped up the stairs and cracked open a bottle of Zima to help settle his nerves. After two more bottles Wendell’s anger was mostly forgotten, he flipped on the TV and spent the evening watching a “Monster Garage” marathon.  GAME NIGHT: It was a dark and stormy night. Lightening flashed, thunder thundered, wind howled, rain slashed down pelting everything and everyone foolish enough to expose themselves to the tempestuous onslaught.  On the southern edge of the Ultimate field the seven men and six women of Swarm gathered together like muskox in a blizzard hoping to somehow ward off the rain and maintain body heat before the game began. Across the muddy morass the players of Wham-O appeared to be lounging in an inexplicable shaft of brilliant warmth &amp; sunshine as they gathered to sing “O Canada” on this balmy July 1st evening.  The game began and Wham-O jumped out to an early lead. Discs that appeared poorly thrown would somehow find their way directly into the hands of it’s intended Wham-O target, often bouncing off a Swarm’s skull or left buttock en route. Large puddles would open up and swamp a Swarm player but then mysteriously dry up and disappear entirely when a Wham-O player ran by.  Even impartial observers would have had to admit that something was fishy. Unfortunately there were no impartial observers watching anywhere.  AT STAN &amp; NANCY’S: Stan was screaming “B_llshit! This is total BS!” but we’ve already established that Stan was far from impartial.  Nancy was giggling with glee as her team unleashed a Costco sized can of whoopass on the nasty Swarm. “Oh precious, yes, beat the nasty Swarm, yes, we hates them, we kills them, yes!”  AT WENDELL’S: Wendell sat on his couch, completely dumbfounded. He could see what was going on but was completely impotent to counteract it. He tried holding his breath, flailing his arms and thinking really hard but that didn’t do any good. He tried throwing things and cursing, which did make him feel a little better, but it didn’t effect what was happening on the field. He then decided to go next door and snap the shrew in half.  He ran out his door and attempted to jump over the white picket fence but at the apex of his jump he ran headfirst into some disconcertingly dense air. In fact the air didn’t possess the most important properties of air – like being breathable and permeable. Upon further examination Wendell discovered that his entire home appeared to be surrounded by this oddly un-airy air. Wendell did what anyone would do in his situation and tried repeatedly to smash through the invisible barrier with his face but after he regained consciousness the second time he gave up and trudged back inside to watch the conclusion of the game and start packing up his stuff.  AT SUSIE’S: “Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow. Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here. It’ll be here, better than before. Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone.” Susie danced around her living room in a somewhat embarrassing manner, lip-syncing along to the words. Fireworks appeared over her head and she leaped onto the back of her unicorn and flew around her suddenly colossal living room. (Isn’t it amazing what a goddess can do when she finally sits down and reads the manual?!)  AT ANGUS’: Angus rolled off the bed and headed for the kitchen. He grabbed two glasses of water and then headed back into the bedroom. “Here you go lass, now since we’ve got a few minutes before my wee caber’s ready for another go, I’ll tell you the story of how…” In the back of his mind he had a vague recollection that something important was going on tonight but that thought quickly slipped away as he recounted one of his favorite Caber Toss stories to a disinterested but attentive goddess.  AFTER THE GAME: The disconsolate Swarm sat in the mud and tried to understand what had happened. Even with their best effort they had had their butts handed to them…again. To add insult to defeat, about two minutes after the game ended the mud dried up, the clouds parted and the temperature rose fifteen degrees. The team couldn’t help feeling frustrated that even though they were obviously all absolutely faultless in all of their losses, the universe was continuing to conspire against them. The team considered ways to overcome these hexes, spells and malicious deities but all their only ideas were: everyone abstaining from sex or everyone engaging in a Matrix’esque orgy. Both solutions seemed worse than the problem they were attempting to fix so it was agreed that nothing would be done and no one would speak of it again.  After that the Swarm went out and succeeded in losing their next game as well. No scapegoat was readily available for this loss.  CONCLUSION: Wendell spent the next few months repairing log-sized holes in the walls of his new house.  Angus continued to be Angus but he gradually gained a reputation as a really dumb guy who was very popular with the ladies.  Susie was integral to Angus’ “transformation”.  Swarm went on to win some, and lose some, but through it all their Spirit rating remained reassuringly low.  Everyone continued to enjoy pie.

"             16He [the beast] also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 17so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. 18This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it  is man's number. His number is 666. Revelation 13    Prologue  What does the mark mean? What is the significance of 666? What does it mean? To answer all these questions, I will critically interpret the history of this two thousand year old mystery. This symbol generates great curiosity among many people and volumes of works have been written on it. In fact, the Google search engine pulls out 2,950,000 entries for “666”! This further indicates the depth of the subject matter. It is also noteworthy that the symbol has been abused and read into to promote unhealthy and non-Christian theology.  In this paper, I will argue that the number of the beast, 666, is merely the name of the beast and not a magical number of any kind. I will show that John indeed identified the mark (666) with the beast for he clearly states that the mark is the name of the beast. Therefore there is no need to read the text backwards starting with the mark in order to identify a certain beast—this is the eisegesis I will argue against.   In Search of the Beast   The symbol 666 has been misinterpreted and misused for millennia. I will now survey some of its most significant misuses. Many people, like Gary Blevins1, believe that the mark will be an invisible laser tattoo injected under the skin or a microchip that will be placed under the skin for scanning at the point of trade. Such people ignore the fact that the original audience of the book, for whom Revelation was written, understood what John had communicated to them. Therefore, since lasers and microchips were virtually unknown 2000 years ago, this “interpretation” should be discarded.     Other people like Blevins are literally obsessed with the number 666 and look for names that match them to identify the beast. Needless to say, such people can get stockpiles of names like the one Blevins2 mentions in his book, Ronald Wilson Reagan! It is interesting, though, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan are still haunted by this number. The Reagans retired to a house in 1989 at 666 St. Cloud Road, Beverly Hills.  Nancy had the address changed to 668!  Others do not count the letters of peoples’ names to identify them with the beast but they look at their character, political affiliation and philosophy to see if they are the rightful owners of the mark, 666. Some of the people identified with the beast and given the mark include:  Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Anwar el-Sadat, David Rockefeller, Pat Robertson, Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther, Nero Caesar, Benito Mussolini, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates, Mikhail Gorbachev, John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger. Other world known figures identified with the beast  in their time include: Willy Brandt, Caligula, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Emperor Frederick II of Germany, King George II of England, Emperor Justinian, Ayatollah Ruhulah Khomeini, Nikita Khrushchev, Sun Myung Moon, Napoleon Bonaparte,Czar Peter the Great, Pete Seeger, Josef Stalin, Kaiser Wilhelm and  Boris Yeltsin.  Other people like, Tal Brooke3, are more radical as they believe that global banking, laser scanning, and the universal bar codes are part of the 666! Brooke and others like him shun all signs of world unity including unity and the oneness of the Church and they see  World Council of Churches (WCC) and similar organizations as a sign of satanic globalism!—obviously ignoring the fact that unity and oneness of the Church is what Christ prayed for! (John 17:11). Others, including M.J. Agee, believe that the mark may even be used as it appears in the Greek, , pointing out that the  middle letter, xi, resembles a serpent4; since serpent became a kind of Satan’s nickname in the Bible, this is not a bad exegesis though too simplistic.  The newest edition of Oxyrhynchus Papyri contains a fragmented papyrus of Revelation which dates around 3rd century. This papyrus gives the beast number 616 instead of the customary 666. This was the western Roman Empire where Latin was dominant. Needless to say, 665 was not also uncommon. Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp,  quotes and refutes this 616 number5 but this papyrus is the earliest ever found giving the beast this odd number (see attachment #1).  But one may wonder why numbers matter. In fact, during the Roman era, numbers fascinated educated Greeks and playing games based on numerals was a popular pastime. This process was known gematria in Hebrew and isopsephia in Greek. The Greek numerals are represented by letters. For example, alpha =1, beta = 2 and theta = 9, and so on (see attachment #2). The quote below best illustrates the power of numerals among Roman era Greeks:  “This “popular parlour-game”…could be given a satirical or polemical slant. If numbers can equal words and phrases, they can also equal proper names. Take the Emperor Nero ….In Greek, he is NERON (with an omega). Add up the values of these letters and you get 1005. Add up the letters of IDIAN METERA APEKTEINE (killed his own mother) and you also get 1005. So Nero = killed his own mother.”6  It was thus easy to go from a word to its number and this did not take a rocket scientist. It only required some one who could read and add numerals as there was only one way to do it and it is impossible, though, to go backwards from the number to the name (words).        John’s readers were familiar with the letter and number ratio as that was known by all who used letters of the alphabet for numerical systems. This process was always used to conceal the identity of the person in question. A well-known graffito by Pompeii (c. AD 79) says “I love her whose number is 545.” It is obvious that only those who knew her name or the names of the candidates could unlock this puzzle. It will be insane if a modern person tried now to figure out her name! Furthermore, The Hebrew letters of Balaam amount to 666 and the name of Jesus in Greek equals 888.    Many have suggested, too, that Nero was the beast (with the mark 666) implying that John’s prophecy was already fulfilled. This means that no beast, whether his number is 666, 616, or 665, will ever show up again. This school of thought believes that Revelation is not a prophesy of what is to come but a relation with the immediate application of then and there in the first century. This view is known as preterist.            One reason people held this is the fact that Nero portrayed many of the evil signs of the beast. However, another reason is related to his name because the transliteration of Neron Caesar, his official name, into Hebrew is nrwn qsr that total the number 666. Even if spelled without the final n, it also becomes 616 counting for the other variant reading. Furthermore, Nero was known among his contemporaries as a “beast” because of his ruthless behavior and poor ethics.  F.F. Bruce, puzzled by how people were obsessed with number said: “The three rules for making any name yield the desired 666 are: (1) if the proper name itself will not yield it, add a title; (2) if the sum cannot be found in Greek, try Latin, or Hebrew; (3) if that does not work, misspell it!”7 Volkmar, Kliefoth and Moffatt said that the number is that of a specific individual though they did not name that person. However, it is important to know that John expected his audience to know the beast he was describing to them. John never meant to confuse his audience—he wanted them to inform. Believers who saw (or will see) the beast had (will have) no trouble recognizing him. Believers should therefore avoid the supersonic prophets who are using bizarre and arcane tactics to identify the beast—this is beside the point John was making for he never intended to be mysterious.   However, believers should not be caught up in this fanatic gematria because there is nothing that is magic with the generic number 666. For example, the Holy Bible equals 666 in gematria! Here is the how it works:   H  72 O  79 L  76 Y  89  B  66 I   73 B  66 L  76 E  69    Total 666         The above values I used are in fact ASCII computer alphabet code where, for example, A= 65 and Z=90. This computing system is internationally recognized and used as well. But this was merely to show that those who fiddle with numbers can make them say for them anything they want to hear. What numbers can be done is virtually infinite. Such gematria doesn’t lead to any conclusion as it leads to every conclusion there is and this shows its deficiency. I pray that the madness of the “Christian” gematria stops here. One thing we can learn from this number, 666, is that God’s enemies are numbered and that their deception will be over.     The Beast John Saw  Reading Revelation in its entirety makes clear that that John perceived Empire wide persecution in his time. Reliable sources indicate that such persecution did not take place until well into the 3rd century. However, it is absolutely possible, and it is the likelihood, that John had Nero in mind when he was describing the Beast with the mark as “a man’s name” (13:18 NEB) indicates. Nero portrayed many of the characteristics of the beast including his demanding of his subject to address him as Lord and God. Nero also put a cast image of him in the imperial cult temples to be worshipped (cf. 13:14).     In his description of the beast, John presents to his audience some evil characteristics of Rome and her emperors, particularly Nero, known to his audience. The very description of the beast by John reminds his audience the evil inherent in the system and its emperors. As Andy Johnson put it eloquently:  “…Nero sat for the portrait that aspects of the beast was pattered after.”8  It is also possible, that John had only one person in mind— one and only one and intended his audience to understand it that way as “a man’s name” (13:18 NEB) indicates. This, though, does not rule out the fact that more beasts could emerge in the future as many emerged in the past and some are roaming around today propagating idolatry and blaspheming against the name of the Lord.   There is nothing in the text to indicate that the mark of the beast is literal though we should take the beast seriously. John did not obviously want his readers to take the beast with seven heads and ten horns literally. Why should he then expect them to take the mark literally? It is beside the point to use the mark 666 as magic jigsaw puzzle to predict the future.  When Revelation was read in worship services for praise and worship, the challenge was never to name the “beast” who was persecuting the church by calculating the number (13:18)—they already knew it but it was  to recall and recognize what it was—that it was a beast empowered and used by Satan against the church. In fact, a more accurate translation of the exhortation of 13:18a would be “It is the moment to have discernment” (Ellul’s translation). This translation draws the attention of today’s reader from the frantic decoding fever manifested in today’s “Christian” bookstores “ to discerning where in our own time propaganda is used to idolize political power.”9  John was limited by the culture he lived in and the language he used. John well knew that number seven is a number of completeness like when he speaks about the seventh seal, the seventh bowl and the seventh trumpet. John also uses number six as one of incompleteness and judgment—a judgment which comes in the sixth seal 6:12-17 (physical disturbances), in the sixth trumpet 9:13-21 (mankind killed) and the sixth bowl 16:12-16 (Euphrates dried). John and other believers lived under the sixth Roman Emperor known for his brutality. “Six-six-six” is thus the intensive symbolic expression of incompleteness, idolatry, judgment, and non-fulfillment, evil itself raised to the third power. The number is communicated as symbol, not as by analysis.”10  It is also important to know that the repetition of some thing three times was and still is an Eastern way to expresses emphasis. This kind of threefold repetition is seen throughout the Bible and in Eastern literatures as well (cf. Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). Because six is repeated three times, to make 666, it is to show how complete and perfect his evil ways and ungodliness are.     The Source of the Mark  It is strongly possible that John is getting his concept of the mark from Ezekiel 9: 3b-4 “Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 4 and said to him, 'Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.'” Some scholars have also suggested that John may had in mind the Roman coins which bore the images and the names of the emperors (see attachment #2) used to buy and sell commodities or the imperial seals then in use. “This has a parallel in the Jewish prohibition of images, which for some, such as the zealots, included the image of the emperor on Roman coins.”11   Since the mark is said to be put on the hand and on the forehead, it is unlikely that John meant the coins. John could have been inspired by many more “marks” prevalent in his time like the Jewish phylacteries12, square leather boxes containing scripture passages  worn on the left hand and forehead” used as a sign of piety for the ultra-pious in the 1st century; (cf. Matthew 23:5). The fact that the mark of the beast is put on the right hand, and not on the right hand, is an obvious discrepancy but it is still possible that the mark was modeled after the phylacteries.   Regarding the imperial seals, Deissmann found evidence in the “papyri for a stamp printed on deeds of sale with the name and year of the reigning emperor….Deissmann observed that the brand embodied the name or number of the beast (v 17), concerning buying and selling”.13 This finding is very significant.   According to Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology, the Greek term, Charagma, mark, was very commonly used for imprints on documents or coins, too. “Charagma is well attested to have been an imperial seal of the Roman Empire used on official documents during the first and second centuries.”14 The only other reference to charagma, in the New Testament (outside Revelation) occurs in Acts 17: 29 where it certainly stands for an image formed by art with design and skill. It is also known that the charagma was a kind of brand used in the Roman era to brand the disobedient or runaway slaves. Their mark always indicated one of ownership very much like brands of cattle today. Tattooing for religious purposes was also widespread. Roman soldiers also willingly bore the name of their most liked General tattooed or branded on them.  It is clear from the context, though, that John did not expect real literal branding or tattooing on his followers. His whole point was to make a spiritual point using a known customary practice to communicate a spiritual point.   A Literal Mark or a Metaphor?  This concept is first used in Exodus 13:9 as a metaphor “ This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.” But if we take literally that the beast will put a literal mark of 666 on the hands and foreheads of his followers (13:16), we will be required by logic and context to admit, too, that believers will have 777, the supposed number of God, or any other good mark on their hands and foreheads (7:3). The point I am driving home is that what is true of one group should be true of the second group for it is written that they will both carry marks (13:16;14:1) on their skins.  However, one plausible explanation of the marks that the groups receive is to say that they are merely spiritual likeness: those who worship God have the spiritual likeness of God and those who worship the beast have the spiritual likeness of the beast. This way of understanding the marks seems the most faithful to John’s rendering of the marks.     As Augustine said, “The mark in the right hand and forehead implies the prostration of bodily and intellectual powers to the beast's domination. 'In the forehead by way of profession; in the hand with respect to work and service.”15 This is another way to make sense of the mark and literalism fails its proponents miserably.   The beast with the ten horns and the seven heads, the leopard-bear-lion unit will also need to be taken literally by the “literalists.” Therefore, the truth is that neither the “dinosaur” horns nor the marks are literal but metaphors. There will not be a need to write literal writings on people but their deeds will spell out, loud and clear, where each one’s allegiance is.  Those who refuse to bow down to the beast by aligning themselves with God will be denied the basic necessities of life like food, shelter and clothing—a kind of trade sanction. The whole earthly system will count against them, but they will win at the end of the day.   The truth of the matter is that there are countless beasts that came and went since John wrote his Revelation. Everyone who “sits for the portrait of the beast” qualifies as one. There will certainly be more beasts to come—I do not know how many but the obsession with one, single, specific beast coming at the end of the age with a literal 666 mark on him should be discarded. Also, as words need to be translated, symbols, too, need to be translated—including the symbol of the beast, the much dreaded mark.     The Violated Book  This book is very well known and for the wrong reasons usually. Though it is the last book of the sixty-six books of the Bible, it happens to be the first book many people read. It is certain that someone who has not read yet the first sixty-five books of the Bible has nothing to do with this book as it doesn’t offer anything significant that is new.  The problem often starts when people assume the book to be a guideline about what is to happen in the future—a kind of a key for the unknown. Such people think that Jesus gave John a detailed future plan from the beginning of the world to the end. They also believe that the book details how the world will end and when it will end, too!  Many people believe that the Revelation of John foretold the 1st and the 2nd World Wars, the invention of the atomic bomb, the rise of USSR and even its ref flag, the rebirth of the State of Israel, and the ongoing Middle East conflict. No wonder then that this book is used by non-Christians like new Age groups and many fortunetellers to manipulate and confuse the naïve.   Many of these people went far enough as to set a time when the world will end using Revelation! Others established small and dangerous cults and armed themselves to the teeth to fight the beast they claimed was represented by the United States. The Davidic cult of Waco, TX, best illustrates this. Needless to say, all these people missed the mark miserably.       Martin Luther despised Revelation as a Christian book very much like James (which he called “an epistle of straw”) and John Calvin wrote commentaries on the 66 books of the Bible save Revelation! The way the NT was finally put together also speaks volumes. Though Revelation was not the last book written (2nd Peter is), it finds itself at the end of the NT—this is not an accident.        The message of the book, however, should be clear—it is that God wins and triumphs over evil. For this book to be helpful to Christians, its writer should not be seen as a kind of omniscient secretary of God who knew the future. It is compatible with our faith to accept that the writer did not know the future but merely had a strong conviction that God will not abandon his servants in the face of deadly threats and that evil will finally be defeated.                It is true that the whole book of Revelation is abused but chapter 13 is certainly the most vandalized. It is sad that many people who do not take the Bible  seriously and live a life without Christ take the mark of the beast literally and sometimes become fanatics! What is so different with this number? It is as though Jesus said “all the Law and the Prophets hang on that number—666!”       Many Christians have been offended by this very exploitation of chapter 13, especially verses 16-18. This passage was used as a basis for occult practices, science fiction movies, propaganda against the European Union (EU) and the Uniform Product Code (UPC). Others have claimed credit cards and social security numbers are the mark of the beast. No wonder that many Christians do not read Revelation let alone reading chapter 13 alone for their private devotions or public worship. It is as though Revelation became a spiritual liability.         However, this is not to ignore that many people (maybe, out of curiosity) indeed want to receive the mark of the beast! One may wonder why but the beast and his distinct mark—666 became exotic and cool for many spiritually blind people who think the beast as a joke or a fabulous thing to be sought after! Here is one practical research that could shock the sensible:  “A very informative 'Mark of the Beast' 'spoof' was recently staged on the Internet by Bill Cross. Bill wanted to try his hand at setting up a website. Bill decided for his first project, 'a spoof website of a company peddling the mark of the beast'. So Global Monetary was created with the advertising 'Become an IDchip member and Receive $250!'. Not wanting to cause real panic, Bill admittedly laced the site, 'with enough clues so that anyone who scrutinized it would know it wasn't for real and would therefore not panic.' Bill was surprised, 'On the first full day of operation the site had more that 4,200 distinct user sessions averaging 6 minutes each'. Emails began pouring in from hysterical Christians, privacy enthusiasts, the media world requesting interviews, and many who recognized it was simply a 'joke'.  Realizing things were getting 'out of hand', after just four days, Bill 'pulled the plug' on Global Monetary.   Bill also made this 'alarming' statement, 'I realized that I was getting another kind of visitor to the site: People who actually wanted to receive the mark of the beast just to get in on the IPO. I was totally blind-sided by that. I never expected that to happen. . .'16  How could one explain this unfortunate finding? The only explanation I know is that, out of ignorance, many people are playing with fire and they need serious help. It is time for the church to step up and save the naïve.  Many of these people are fascinated by the “power” of the beast and their subtle dualism kicks in and that is why they give too much attention to the beast and admiration for his miracles. They are like the ones who shout “”Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him” (13:4). I must be quick to mention that the beast has no power other than that he was temporarily given by God. John did not leave this unsaid; he says that the beast, like his lieutenant, is out there just to deceive. The beast’s lieutenant, certainly another beast, (13:11) “has two horns like a lamb”, John writes. A horn was supposed to show authority, strength and power. It is the rule of the jungle that animals with horns, tusks, and fang-like teeth best survive in the bush where only the fittest survive. But what about the little stubby non-fatal lamb horns the beast has? They are fake! The beast wants to pretend that he has real power and authority to bully the inhabitants of the earth but he doesn’t—his power is artificial and his horns are not horns. This alone should quench the idolatrous passion many people have for the beast and his demons for they are weak creatures that are not in match with the Creator.        Epilogue  Regarding the mark, it should not be taken literally as I illustrated above. This is what consistence requires. Furthermore, it is true that theories on this issue change allot faster than I can mention. The only unchanging and reliable thing to do is to remain true to Revelation itself. John shares some important specifics about the mark:  ·No one is exempted from  receiving the mark (13:16). This is a worldwide campaign, everyone will get the mark. No class of people or age group is exempted.    ·The mark and worshiping the beast are inseparable twosome (14:9; 14:11; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4). Five out of the seven times the mark is mentioned, it is directly tied to worshipping the beast. No one will get the mark by mistake or accidentally. One has to worship the beast to get it.   ·The beast owns this mark (16:2; 19:20). This mark is the beast’s and it stands in contrast with God’s mark. The mark of the beast is bogus mark fashioned after God’s. God’s mark is for protection—even for disobedient  sinners like Cain: “13 Cain said to the LORD , 'My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.'  15 But the LORD said to him, 'Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.' Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.” Genesis 4. Ezekiel 9 also says: “4 and said to him [the Lord], 'Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.' 5 As I listened, he said to the others, 'Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 6 Slaughter old men, young men and maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.' So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.” This is the mark of God giving life but the forged mark of the beast takes life and takes it painfully.   ·It is either the name of beast or the number of his name (13:17). Though whether the mark is literal or metaphor is debated, one thing is certain—people will get it. Whether people choose to get the number or the name, it is all the same at the end of the day—it is probably only a matter of style and fashion but they all lead to death, a painful one. Christians should avoid adding up numbers in order to identify the beast for once the beast comes he will not be able to hide. There is nothing magic with the number  666 for it is found other places in the Bible (1Kings 10; and 2Chronicles 9).   I have never heard of anyone identifying King Solomon with the beast (anti-Christ) though Solomon was most noted for, among others, his great wisdom, his introduction of idolatry to Israel  and for rebuilding the Temple. It is precisely these three things, among others, that the beast will also do. Sooner or later, if the madness of playing with numbers continues unchecked, a liar will open his mouth and say that Solomon was the beast.  ·No one can sell or buy without the mark (13:17). An economic boycott, and starvation therefore, awaits those who reject worshiping the beast. Because of the beast’s one world order, there will not be a hiding place. Those who do not accept the mark will indeed be killed. The function of the mark is therefore to allow one to buy and sell as it is also a symbol of allegiance.     ·Anyone who receives the mark will not be saved (14:9-11) The matter of worshipping the beast is one of personal decision. Whoever decides to worship him denies himself or herself of salvation.  Revelation 14 says “...If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, 10he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.'  May we be the ones who worship the Lord alone and shun the beast, the master deceiver.     Source:   BLib 9176           Endnote  1.1. Gary D.

"       Speech by TUN DAIM ZAINUDDIN   I was appointed two years ago as lecturer but I regret that until today I have not delivered a single lecture. Just as in the case of students who don't attend a single lecture, this University has asked me to repeat my term for another two years.   I have not chosen any special topic for my lecture but as this was an invitation from the business school, I thought it appropriate that we talk about running and managing a business.  As I am no expert,I can only base it on my own personal experience.   I retired in 1977 after making my money. I thought I deserved a rest so I took time off, went back to university to study, to recharge my batteries, but before long, the then Deputy PM asked me to come back to help at UDA.  I came back and started Peremba. I also went back to business but this time, I found a new area to make money _ the stock market but don't let anyone tell you that that is the easiest path to making money. It was as worrisome as when I was in Maluri. In 1984, I joined the government and in compliance with government directives, I had to sell all my shares including shares in a bank. As 1984_1985 were the years of recession, I had to sell at very low prices. I could have realized more from my assets if our economy was not in recession.   I left in 1991, after seven years as Finance Minister. I went back into business, back to the same playing field that I was very familiar with. Whilst I am now actively back in business, I also give free advice to those who sought my advice.   While I have been successful, Alhamdulillah, I cannot guarantee you will succeed based on my advice. But those who have worked with me in Peremba Tan Sri Azmi, Razali, Dato Halim, Hassan, Dato Samsudin Hassan have all become millionaires in their own right. No company has produced so many successful people that Peremba was dubbed 'the University of Peremba'. I don't know if they followed my guidelines but I know they all worked very hard when they were with me. There are other Bumis and Non-Bumis who sought advice and help from me and are now very successful. I shall not mention their names as I do not want to take credit for their success. I am happy for them.   Some of you I am sure would like to know if you follow faithfully what I have to say, would that be a guarantee for success? In life, the only guarantee is death. Let's face it. If all of you go out from here and straight away go into business, not all will succeed. My advice is merely a guideline and unless you try, you will never know the ultimate result.   For tonight's lecture, I suggest I spend half the time talking and the balance for a question and answer session.  This way, we will be able to exchange views. While I will talk to you about business in general, I will focus specifically on Malay Business.    Notwithstanding common misconceptions, Malays have been involved in business for centuries. Malays were traders trading with Sumatra, Java, China and India. However, the British policy of economic segregation coupled with their immigration labour policy led to the concentration of Malays in the agricultural sector. With Merdeka and the economic boom activities of the 50s and 60s, the Malays were not content to remain in the kampongs while the wealth of the country was in the hands of foreigners and non-Malays. Their discontentment erupted in 1969. Then came the NEP. The NEP was not formulated to provide for handouts and charity to the Malays. It was a vehicle to level the playing field for the Malays, to enable them to catch up with their more advanced fellow citizens. Even in golf, if you are a beginner playing with a more experienced person, you are given a handicap.   The NEP has produced many Malays who are successful in business and in other economic and non-economic endeavours. Now we have many Malays who are millionaires and billionaires. How did they become successful in business? Yes, there was the NEP that gave Malays the chance but not all Malays who went into business are successful there are just as many bankrupt Malays.   The question you should ask before you embark on any business venture is whether you really want to succeed.  If the answer is positive, ask yourself how strong is your desire to succeed?  Do you have the strength, stamina and discipline to succeed? Are you prepared to give your all, your time and money and are you prepared to work and study to achieve your ambition?  If again the answers are positive, you have the makings of a successful person. These qualities segregate the successful ones from those who fail.   There is no magic formula to starting and maintaining a successful business. You start with the technicalities and practicalities of starting a business. Whether to have a sole proprietorship, a partnership or a company, each has its own pros and cons, its own risks and benefits. Then you have to think about office space, location, staff, support equipment, factory space and land, as the case may be. All these cost money and it is not, I repeat, not necessary to ensure success that you must have a big office, many staff and a Mercedes Benz.  These are burdens that you don't need when you are starting. The time for fancy cars and a fancy office will come later, if you insist that you must have them, but remember to make your money first before spending it. I shall tell you a secret _ you also do not need to play golf to be successful. (If you do not believe me, you can ask the Prime Minister.)   What kind of business should you get into? What would determine your choice? You look, you read, you listen, but in the end you have to make your own decision. You have to decide.  You may like some businesses but they make little money. In some, there is big money but you may not like it. But remember, you go into business to make money. No one wants to go into business to end up a bankrupt.  However, there is no point in going into a business that you have absolutely no interest in.  You can't run a sports shop if you can't tell a badminton racquet from a squash racquet, nor be a contractor if you can't stand being out in the sun. You must like what you are doing, it must interest you when you start and hold your interest as you go along.  Work should be satisfying, something you look forward to, otherwise you will give up at the slightest hint of a problem. If, however much you like the business, but it is not profitable, then you have to stop being a dreamer and be practical. If you can marry what you like with what that can make money, then I would say that you are indeed a very lucky person.   To determine whether you are going to be successful in what you are planning to do, you would not go far wrong if you ask yourself what it is that people want or need. If you can meet either their needs or wants, then you are halfway there.   People need the basics of food, clothing and shelter.  People's wants are limitless. If you are in the business of satisfying needs, there will always be a market for your products _ a humble rojak man will still be in business alongside multinationals like McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Whether the rojak man will be just as successful will depend on his product, the rojak. If it offers the right combination of price and quality and a consistency of these two factors, he will in his own way be successful.   The food business is indefinite _ from 'mee abu' or the burger stall to conglomerates. You can be a stall owner selling satay or you can set up a chain; you can be a farmer planting padi or you can practise integrated farming where fish and prawn breeding can fetch handsome profits; you can sell beef or lamb at the local market or you can supply and distribute internationally _ think of the Haj when millions of cows and sheep are slaughtered. You can sell fruits by the roadside or you can run fruit plantations. It is the same with other needs and wants of your customer. You are only limited by your imagination and your ability to work hard. If your finished product costs less than your competitor's and has zero defect the market is yours. Once the market is yours you are on the right road.    In my case, I went into the business that answered people's basic needs and wants. First, I went into the salt business _ I thought, what can go wrong? Everybody needs salt. What would our food be like without salt? So my partners and I went to Japan, Thailand and Taiwan to study the process. We studied weather reports to see where we should site our salt fields and factory.  We knew everything there was to know about salt and then we opened our salt fields. Then came the rain and washed away our salt, our hard work and our money. We persevered and tried again but this was followed by the big flood of 1970! We nearly became bankrupts. I had to make that tough decision _ cut losses or continue. I knew my strengths and my limitations and whilst I knew I could control some things in business, the weather was not one of them. So I closed down the business. But I never said die and I never gave up _ so I went into another basic need _ housing.    We identified the land, drew up the plans, then went on the merry-go-round to get approvals. That was not easy at all. We had to deal with so many government departments and financial institutions. It was a very frustrating process. By then, I knew business was not easy. Business is very complex where sometimes one is confronted with problems to which there are no easy answers. But we must not be dismayed if we take a long time to find answers to the questions. We persevered and months later got all the necessary approvals and permits.   Then we were ready to start business. But I was inexperienced and the contractors, architects and engineers knew that this was my first project. I, however, made it clear to them that I may be new at this but I was not stupid. I was at the site every day; I watched everything; I read up; I asked questions and at the end of the day, I lay in bed going over the day's problems and how to solve them. I built Taman Maluri on ex-mining land.  When we were laying the pipes for the sewerage, the engineers suggested that we go 40 ft. down. I knew that if we were to go down 40 ft., we would have water gushing out. I thought about it and suggested that we used pumps instead and it worked. Were they testing me? I don't know but I knew that my solution earned their respect.  I was at the site day and night to solve any problems that could arise. I never put off to tomorrow what I could do today.  Every day of delay costs money. Interest accumulates even when you are sleeping. I was also everything from manager to office boy. I had only three or four staff when I started. One secretary, one messenger boy and one sales staff. I ran a very lean and tight office. The engineers, surveyors, site supervisors, contractors were not my employees but all were engaged as consultants for the project. As such, I need not worry about EPF, SOCSO, medical and insurance benefits. I took no salary but only an allowance to cover my family's needs. I had to keep costs down because until you sell, there is no income.    I was worried that we could not sell the houses. So I made sure that the houses would not only meet the standard of buyers but gave more than they expected, better quality and better design.  We made our roads wider.  We provided a letter box, a place for rubbish; at that time this was something different, something special. Now these are standard features. Where the minimum ceiling requirement was 10 feet, we made it higher.  These things do not cost much more, but it made our houses different and better.   We also made our houses affordable. Our single-storey link was sold at RM17,500; double-storey link at RM48,000.  Alhamdulillah, the houses sold like hot cakes and we have never looked back.  Success tastes even sweeter in the aftermath of failure.   I may have made all this sound simple. All my years of hard work condensed into a few paragraphs. But it was sweat and tears and there were times when I despaired of ever making it _ we faced it all _ from sleepless nights, long hours in the office, begging banks, in particular bank officers, running so often to government departments and sometimes having to deal with petty-minded officers with big egos and big stomachs. We were given the run-arounds enough to test the patience of a saint. I swallowed my pride and learned to be patient. At the beginning, nothing is easy. Things only look simple after you have succeeded and your bank account is no longer in the red.   There is no guarantee, of course, that if you venture into the housing industry, you will succeed. What if the market crashes and buyers withdraw to cut losses? What if consumer tastes change? What if, for example, you have these rows of houses, built and ready but no one buys? If you can sell, you prosper; otherwise you suffer.  These are the challenges that you will face, and you will face challenges in whatever business you choose.   Whether you will be able to weather the challenges really depends on you. You have to face the problems and try to sort them out. Problems have to be solved; they will not go away however much you hope and pray that when you wake up and like magic, they have disappeared. Whether you will be able to solve the problems or not depend on you and your preparation before you even embark on the project. Even if some things are beyond our control, if you have done a thorough study and know your market, the chances are you will have anticipated the problems and be able to solve them. You would have alternative plans and answers. Whilst you see abandoned projects, abandoned factories and businesses, you can also see that some sell even in the worst of time. Why?  Because they know how to read the market _ their product sells, whatever the market or economic condition.   Your organization is also important if you want to succeed in your business. Have a proper organization and draw out a management chart. Authority flows from the top.   It is people that makes your business a success.  Choose the right type. Get those who are hard working, disciplined, dedicated and honest. You can make the stupid learn. But the lazy, you will find them a great burden. Reward your staff for good per-formances.   Take good care of your staff and they will take good care of your business. But the lazy ones must be sacked. Don't allow them to destroy the good ones. Be firm but fair.   Be compassionate to those who are willing learners, but show no leniency to the lazy. Bad influence is like cancer and unless attended to, it will spread easily. Good behaviour is not that easy to acquire. So train your staff to be efficient and cost conscious. Remember in business, there is always competition and competition is good. It keeps you alert and on your toes all the time. Only your costs can decide if you will do well or otherwise. Cost and quality will determine your market share. Control these two and your market is safe. So show them leadership. You must be the first to come and the last to go. After all, it is your organization. You have to lead, be a good leader so that your employees can trust and count on you. If you are playful and undisciplined, the rest of the staff will take their cue from you. If you work hard, they will work as hard. Therefore, instil good qualities, i.e. honesty, hardwork, thrift, discipline and deter-mination; make sure time is never wasted.   Every-thing must be done on time. Remember, time is money.   Other than tight control on staff, you must have a tight control on finance. Discourage waste. Make sure every single cent is accounted for. Remember 100 cents make a dollar. It is from cents that you will make your millions one day. It is your money not your staff's, so you have to be diligent and ensure proper control. Saving money means making money.   You may have the best management team, you may have the finance, you may have the contacts but whether you succeed or fail will still depend on you. You must have in you the qualities that will determine success. What are these qualities?  I believe they are:   First, hardwork, hardwork and more hardwork. Rewards come to those who are willing to work hard. Business is hard work and sacrifices. Don't waste time looking at the clock. There is no such thing as 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sometimes, it is 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You may have to give up your leisure and holidays, be on call 24 hours a day, available at any time to make decisions, give directions and solve problems.   You have to be dedicated and have perseverance. It is a sacrifice and if you are not prepared to make the initial sacrifice, you cannot enjoy the benefits later. I have yet to come across a success story with the main character not putting in any effort.   There is no substitute for hard work. Work hard to make your dreams come true. If you believe strongly in what you are doing and want to make it a success, the fight to succeed is worth all your time and sacrifice. Never stop until you succeed.   Second, you must have a passion, a fire in you to do well.  It must keep burning in you until you succeed. The determination to succeed will help to ensure success. Without strong determination, you will be unsure of success. Your strong desire for success will motivate you to work hard.   The determination to succeed is the prime reason many achieve their goals. Success breeds success, and with success comes confidence. If you want something badly enough, it will happen because you will make it happen but it will only happen if you work hard at it. If you want to do something, try it.   Don't be afraid. You must believe you can do anything you want to do. If you work very hard to achieve it, once you set a goal, persevere to accomplish it. You should not accept defeat and refuse to quit even when faced with failure. You may stumble, but if you have the determination, you will get up and move on. You will be conscious of future pitfalls but when you are down, there is no where else to go except up.   Trust your instincts and commonsense. You should know yourself. Have confidence in your decisions, your ability and your judgement; if you believe in yourself, others will too, but if you make a mistake, do not be afraid to admit it and to learn from it. In short, never give up. Never stop learning.   Third, you must have pride in your work but do not be too proud to ask and to learn. Pride in your business is important _ this will urge you to succeed and do well. You must want to be the best in your chosen field. If you have a sense of shame, you will make sure that you will not fail. If you do not want to fail, you will plan well and work hard to ensure that you will not fail.   But do not be too proud to learn from others, to ask for opinions, to seek advice, consult people. Don't be shy. Be prepared to learn. Be humble, be friendly _ you may never know whose help you may need. Be particularly friendly to your bankers. Banks have the habit of asking back for their umbrellas when it rains. If the officers are sympathetic to your problems, you will get another chance.   Fourth, a good education is fundamental. You need education appropriate to your goals. Read everything.  Education does not end when you graduate. If you read, you will learn new things and may even find the answers to your problems.   Read about your business, about management, about finance, about new innovations in the market. Read the law on companies, duties of directors.  Some Malay businessmen want to be directors and at the very least, Managing Directors, if not Chairman. They are under the wrong impression that Directors have no responsibilities other than attending meetings and entertaining people. Read the Companies Act and you will know what it entails being a Director.   The first word of God was 'Iqra' _ Read. Read also for pleasure, widen your horizon, do not be a person who is encyclopedic about his business and knows nothing about the world around him. Nurture an intellectual curiosity about everything around you.   Fifth, you must want to be in business and you must love the profession to give your all to it. Some Muslims believe this world is for the non-Muslims, that Muslims should only pray and think of the hereafter. So why go into business and make money? You can't take the money with you when you die. For the Malays and Muslims, we have to change that belief. It is a wrong interpretation of the Islamic faith. I have yet to come across any religion that discourages its followers from doing business.    As long as it is not haram and your business practices are not immoral, I cannot see any reason why Muslims cannot pursue a career in business. As long as in the pursuit of success, you do not forget your religious obligations, I think it is possible to be both a businessman and a good Muslim.   Going into business is to make profits, but your ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life of those around you and to contribute to the nation. It is the people t hat make the country. If they work hard and succeed, then their success is the country's success.  If the people do well, the country will do well, and your contribution to the country's success however small, is an act of charity.   Sixth, you must, like the Boy Scouts, be prepared. You must go in with your eyes open, realistic of the risks and benefits, of the pitfalls that await you. In business, you take risks but you must not be reckless. You must be prepared to face challenges, not be afraid to face problems because you have already anticipated the problems and are prepared to meet them.    With time and practice, you will be able to handle problems with ease; you will acquire the ability to respond to problems, to train yourself to think quick and fast. Like all fields, in the field of business, you need brains to succeed. It is not the strongest or the fastest man or woman for that matter who wins.  It is the person who thinks that wins; therefore be a strategist.    Seventh, Discipline. You must exercise both mental and financial discipline. Discipline also means that you should do today what is needed to be done today no matter how tired you are or how tempting it is to put it off.    Discipline also means that you keep to appointments, to promises, to time, to schedules that you deliver what you say you would, when you say you would; that you honour your word; that you keep to your budget and control your cost; that you are honest notwithstanding the temptations that await you; being disciplined in your thinking and plans mean that you do not get carried away by grandiose plans, straying into ventures that have no relevance to your core businesses; that you are well organized and orderly in whatever you do.   It is very important to develop early your priorities, values and sense of proportion and spend your energy and resources to achieve your desired result. When you are disciplined, mentally, physically and financially, you will have the ability then to handle whatever comes your way. In other words, have focused concentration.   Eighth, be brave, be innovative, be creative and imaginative, be unafraid to take calculated risks and challenges; think the unthinkable, dream the impossible.  Sometimes, when you let your mind wander, unfettered by conventional thinking parameters, you might just find the right solution to your problems. But do not be foolhardy: your bravery must be tempered by practicalities, not recklessness that would jeopardize your business and your future.   Business is an adventure. It is not for the timid and the indecisive, those so afraid of failure that they dare not take the first step. Be brave and take a risk _ a ship in harbour is safe but it is not what a ship is for.  Business is an adventure that is both exciting and exhilarating and yet full of unseen dangers lurking at corners, but at the end of the day, it is an adventure worth undertaking and most fulfilling if accomplished well.    Whilst you must be realistic about your expectations, you must also think big. Not big cars, big houses but to think about your business. You have to start small but you must plan ahead not just for tomorrow or the next few years. You must think about how big your business is going to be 10 years, 20 years down the road. And to plan that far ahead, you must have a picture in your mind, a dream in your head about the future of your business.   As Robert Browning said, 'Alas, but a man's dream must exceed his grasp or what's a heaven for?' Keep dreaming and turn your dreams into reality. That is the hallmark of success.  Aim to be the best and if you achieve it, you will be noticed and will be remembered. Set your ultimate goal but you must also plan your intermediate goals.  In order to reach the top, you move up step by step.    Ninth, be decisive. If you fear to go into business or are doubtful of success, you will, of course, get nowhere.  Indecision is a curse. The test of an entrepreneur is the ease with which a decision is made. It does not matter if it is a wrong decision.   A wrong decision is better than no decision. We have the brains to reason, to think. If you don't act you will never know the result.    Last but not at all the least, you must be interested in making money. Many think money is the root of all evils. It is greed and the love of money that is the root of all evils, when money is an end itself and not a means.  It also depends on what you use your money for. It could be used for good or for evil.  If you use your money to build mosques, give to the poor and needy, it cannot be evil. Don't blame money. Blame those who use money for evil purposes.   To succeed, you must show interest in money and in wanting to make money. There must be that hunger to make money. There must be that strong urge. After making money, to make more money. There is nothing immoral in this urge. If you don't have it, I think you should not go into business.  Business is all about making money. You must enjoy making money.  If you don't enjoy it, do something else. Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying that you should only do something just for money. That alone cannot sustain you. But you are in the business to make money and that you must enjoy.   I would like, however, to distinguish between wanting to make money and greed. Do not be greedy. Greed destroys your self-respect. Do not worship money _ that you would lose your morals and religion for the sake of money. If earned through halal means, God will help you to succeed in whatever you do.   There is a joke about Imelda Marcos that she was in the 'mining' business. Every time she saw a business, she said, 'It is mine, mine, mine,' and look what happened to her.   When you have made money, be generous to those who have not, but only to deserving cases. Be thankful to God. Bersyukor.  Just because you have made lots of money, do not then think that you are superior to or better than the next person. The small courtesies in life are still important _ return phone calls, answer letters, show up on time, be polite, diplomatic, considerate.   Money in the bank is not a licence to be rude or arrogant. Neither does it mean that you have to flaunt your wealth. Conspicuous consumption only shows a weakness in character. If you have earned your money you will not need to bolster your image by surrounding yourself with excesses.  Learn to value your money but do not on the other hand, be someone who knows the price of everything and the value of none. Respect others and they will respect you. Your reputation is important.  Establish a clean reputation.  Make sure you are respected.  Maintain a high standard of integrity. At the end of the day, success isn't money, and it isn't power. The measure of your success isn't measured by the wealth you accumulated, the awards you received, the records you broke, the battles you won but the name you leave behind. There is no price to be placed on your name.    There is no point in being successful in business but a failure in life. Your family and your friends are important. A man with no friends and a dysfunctional family is not a happy man. It's not the money in your bank but people who make you happy. Do not confuse money with superiority. In the eyes of God, remember rich or poor, all are equal.   The above list are just some of the things that I think are important but ultimately all will depend on you.  Do you have the stuff to make it? Are you soft? Are you weak? Or are you the one with determination, courage and enough strength to see the company through difficult times? Each company will have its own problems.  Seldom will you find the answers in textbooks.   Yet, it is important to still read and learn how others solve their problems. All problems are unique to the particular organization, so you will have to use your head, use it wisely, sit down and analyse what has gone wrong. Then find out how best to solve your problem. Do not expect others to do your work for you.    Always remember to aim for excellence. Never settle for second best and second rate. Also remember that the road to success is never smooth. You may stumble along the way. Get up to move on.  You will grow stronger and steadier. Never accept defeat or failure.   Learn from your mistakes but do not repeat them. It would be a great misfortune if having tried and failed you gave up. The strong hearted with the determination and courage and preparedness to learn from past mistakes will in the end triumph.   Some of you may wonder why quite a number fail in spite of putting in so much effort. Is it because they are not lucky? My answer is that luck does play a part. It is sometimes an important element but don't depend on it.  In the end, it is 99% preparation and perspiration, and the rest is luck.   I do not presume that I have all the answers but what I have told you are some of the guidelines and qualities that you may need to succeed in business. There are so many different and some contradictory and some strange roads to riches.  There are so many paths leading to success. The best way to learn how to be a winner is to learn from winners and losers, especially the losers. Most losers lose because they take excessive risks and lack discipline.   In the final analysis, it is up to you to decide what is best. In the end, it is what is in you that determines your success. However, let me remind you that what I have been talking to you today is about how to run a business and be successful in business, NOT that to be successful you must be in business. In whatever endeavour you undertake, if you do your best, if you have pride in your work, if you work to achieve a standard of excellence in your field and if you retain the highest level of personal integrity, then you are a success.  To most people riches reflect success. This need not be so.  Success could be in other fields not confined to business only.  So go explore the Amazon, sing at the Opera, climb the Himalayas, find the cure for cancer, conduct an orchestra, discover a lost tribe in Kalimantan. Do what you want to do as long as it is the best.            ",5.499,7.273,6.02,0.491,0.508,73.184,11.95,0.063,0.762,0.174,7.793,8.17,4.289,2
"               With his makeshift wings spread above him, Basil spiraled upward on a rising updraft. The warm currents of air lifting from the cliffs below filled the taught membranes of his glider. They carried him further and further from the ground beneath him. His mind was somewhere else, somewhere long, long ago.   “Mother! Mother!” Llywiln cried, “Why can’t I fly?” Glymich had been preparing herself for the inevitable questions that she was sure would arise. Ever since her ‘Little Pink Ball’ had taken to speaking, she had practiced responses to “Why am I different? Why don’t I have claws? Why aren’t my teeth pointed?” Somehow the thought of flight had slipped by, it had just never occurred to her. As naturally as dragons took wings and flight for granted, she had just naturally assumed that her tiny Llywiln would take his lack of wings and flight for granted.   That was when Glymich first realized;   He thinks that he is one of us!   As she crouched there thinking of a response, her resolve formed. If her precious Llywiln thought of himself as a dragon, why shouldn’t he be treated as one, including all of the privileges that came with being a member of the most ancient of races. As much as she hated putting him off, the insistent, “Why? Why? Why?” not being the only reason; Glymich told him, “We’ll speak of it later.”   That evening, she cautiously approached Moodrake. He was the largest, and the strongest of the males in Wyre Clatnech. Even had he not been quite so big, or quite so powerful, Glymich would have had misgivings about this impending ‘meywar’ or meeting of the minds. Moodrake was logical, contemplative, and wise beyond his years, but when it came to humans, he was ruled by his emotions. The most prominent of which being, that he hated all things human.   In the darkness, Glymich let her mind reach out toward that strength that was their leader. This was an ability that every dragon possessed; they all had the ability to share their thoughts with one another. It was also a talent that she would never speak of to her precious Llywiln. Knowing that he would never attain the ability to do that, it seemed cruel to even tell him of it. Gently, ever so gently, Glymich nudged at the fortress that was Moodrake’s mind.   The rumbling,   ‘Yes, Glymich, what do you want?’   which tore through her mind, was none-the-less gentle, by Moodrake’s standards. She sighed an inward sigh of relief; at least she had caught him in a good mood. Glymich knew that above all else, she must keep her feelings for Llywiln to the back of her mind. If he found out about her affection for the human, Moodrake would never agree.   ‘Is this about that pet human of yours?’   rumbled through her mind. Had he guessed? No. Quickly, she replied,   ‘Yes, my lord, I was just thinking that maybe we should teach him to fly.’   Glymich braced herself for the explosion of rage that she knew would overwhelm her mind at any moment. She could hardly believe it when her head was filled with the deep, echoing laughter that only a dragon could make.     ‘Angry, why should I be angry?’   he went on. So he could probe her deepest thoughts, she would have to be more careful.   ‘But Moodrake,’   she responded,   ‘he is human, the skies are the domain of the dragons!’   Somehow, it seemed to Glymich, that she had turned out to be more appalled than Moodrake!   ‘Nonsense,’   he continued,   ‘do not the birds, and the lowly insects fly as well?’     'Besides,'   he added,   ‘Teaching him to fly, and him succeeding are two different things. He is just as likely to end up dropping from the sky like a fire rock, leaving only a crater to mark his passing. Then there would just be one less human for us to worry about!’       So that was his game,   Glymich thought to herself;   he thinks that it’s impossible for Llywiln to fly. He plans to let the problem take care of itself.   She would show him, they both would show him just what her little man-drake could do!   When Glymich had presented him with his first glider, fashioned from saplings and shed dragon skins, Llywiln had never been happier, or more excited. When he took to the glider, as naturally as if he had been born with wings, she had never been so proud. When Moodrake found out that the pesky human hadn’t been crushed upon the rocks below, he was never angrier. For weeks, one could see bursts of steam billowing from his cave. It was then, that Llywiln realized; he would have to be very careful around Moodrake.   Basil slipped out of his nostalgic reveries to discover that he had slipped from the rising updraft, and was well on his way along a downward spiral. If he wasn’t careful, the old drake might have gotten his wish yet, even if he wasn’t around to enjoy it. Oddly, Basil missed the cranky old drake. With very little altitude in which to maneuver and the carpet of green treetops was closing quickly. Basil turned sharply towards the south and picked out a small rocky overlook above the Chloridian Forest on which to land. In his distracted state, he had swiftly strayed northward, half the length of the Great Baaleth Range, to the uppermost realms of his mountain home.              Chance hadn’t felt the crate hit him. Then again, he couldn’t feel anything. His first thought, of course, was that Aquar had claimed him. That was of course, the fitting fate of all good sea captains. He was well prepared to spend eternity in Aquar’s realm. After all, in life the sea had been his home, and it had been good to him. Why then, should he not spend the afterlife serving it?   Just as he was resolving himself to his new occupation, an eternal one, a strange scent assailed his senses. It was the scent of smoke, and of cooking that he smelled. He could swear that he heard a sizzling sound. Odd, without body or form he wouldn’t think that he could sense anything. Then the reality of it began to dawn on him. Even if he was bodiless, a spirit trapped within the sea. Even if his spirit could sense things around him, there would be no fire! Somehow, he must still be alive, very puzzled, but alive.   It was then that he heard a crystalline voice, the voice of a siren, or of an angel. Ever so softly it whispered to him, “Close your eyes, this may be bright.” His head still ringing with that sweet voice, Chance clenched his eyes as he felt something soft, gently pulled back across his face. As he felt the orange warmth of the sun envelop his face, he was sure that he was still alive. He wasn’t sure why he was alive, but he was sure that he was.   “We tied you down,” the voice continued, “so the wind and waves wouldn’t wash you away. Later, when the storm had cleared, we covered you to protect you from the sun. How do you feel?” How did he feel? At the sound of the question, Chance almost laughed, ‘feel’ he couldn’t feel a thing! He was however, alive. Based on his assumption of a few moments ago; that was a lot better than he had expected. With a genuine smile, he replied, “I’ll live!” Beyond that, Chance wasn’t too certain as to what he could look forward to.   Slowly, he let his eyes squint open. Above him he saw clear skies, marred by only the lightest of fluffy cumulus clouds, and above him, a dark rounded object that came slowly into focus. As if rewarding him for opening his eyes, he beheld the sweetest face that he had ever seen. With its deep ebon hair, parted by a stripe of white that ran from front to back, sparkling green eyes, and refined thin lips that now opened into an angelic smile, Chance found that he now had a reason to look forward once more. The metallic bronze of her skin seemed to shimmer in the sun, right down to the points of her ears. Points… this had to be the elwess that he had seen on that strange craft!   How could they have survived the storm?   Echoed through his head. Others, of course, replaced these thoughts, as he found himself lost once more within those eyes, and that smile.             Trylla had never seen a human male before, at least not up this close. They were funny, awkward looking things. They seemed big and clumsy; how did they manage to stay upright? No doubt, their bulky frames held more sheer muscle than an elwan, but they lacked the coordination to use it. Their skin was an odd pinkish tan as well, not a proper metallic shade as hers… and what was with those ears? Trylla had to fight to keep from laughing out loud every time she saw them. After all, everyone knew that the more pointed one’s ears, the higher their intelligence. No wonder the poor dullard fell overboard.   Despite all of that, there was something about this big, awkward human that Trylla found strangely exciting. Not in the ‘forbidden food’ sort of way, but more of the ‘simply something of a different nature’ sort of way. There was something about him that pulled at the ‘Nanjar’ in her soul. True, he was funny looking, with his wild red-orange hair and that strange growth of it around his mouth and chin; elwan never grow facial hair. His size also was beyond anything that she had imagined humans to possess. He was a good one and one half times larger than her, with muscular arms and legs. This one was no artist or poet. This was a being that was used to hard work. A soul that had known sorrow, and loss, but still he smiled. What a smile!  It was then, that Trylla knew that she must get to know more of this ‘human’. She resolved herself to experience his being, no matter how strange, at first he may seem.   As she looked up from her administrations to their helpless passenger, she caught a look from Dunkirk out of the corner of her eye. It was not an approving look. In fact, it was a look of downright disapproval. Oh well, not to worry, Dunkirk disapproved of most of the things that Trylla did. He could be so old fashioned!   Still, he was her friend; he did seem to care what happened to her. Sometimes, his advice even proved useful, when she listened to it. The ‘human’ couldn’t move now anyway, so she would humor Dunkirk. After all, when you find yourself alone on a boat in the middle of the sea, and a long way from anyone, or anything else, why upset the one other person on board… But now, they weren’t alone!           Dunkirk kept himself busy with the boat, the nets, and the hundred other little jobs that his tiny hands were so good at. Being the only crew on this miserable journey was a thankless job. On the other hand, the better he cared for the boat, the better his chances of seeing land once again. The greater the care that he took of the nets, the fuller his belly would be, if he could only keep it down.   He had tried to dissuade Trylla from her latest folly, even suggested that they leave him in the sea. She wouldn’t hear of it. Once she pointed out that it could just as easily have been him that had been floating there. There was little more that he could have added after that, except that he had wished that it were. He did not wish the human any true harm; he didn’t know this man well enough to feel about him one way or another. What he had learned of humans though, was enough to make him feel much safer knowing that he couldn’t move. Dunkirk had tried to get some of this across to Trylla through subtle hints, but he knew better than to say anything outright. He knew all too well that once she had set her mind to something, there was very little that could dissuade her, especially, if it was something that she wanted.   That of course, wasn’t going to keep him from letting her know exactly how he felt about it. The look that she gave back to his made it clear, that she understood. It didn’t stop her, but she understood.            Blossom had finished sweeping out the floor of the inn. She was just about to sweep the debris out the door with her thresh broom when she noticed a small package wrapped in leaves. It was sitting on the old stump by the front door. As she quickly looked up, she thought that she had caught a glimpse of a figure in heavy robes, ducking into the shadows of the woods. As she cautiously approached the small parcel, Blossom noticed that it sat upon a small scrap of parchment, on which was scrawled in a simple sloppy hand,  ‘FOR TINEY’ . Rather than touch it herself, she ran into the inn to tell Tiney of her discovery.               “A package you say?” Tiney mumbled looking up from the already spotless bar that he was polishing again. “Let me see!” he grumbled, as he stepped away from his work. The last thing that he wanted to do was to waste time on foolishness, but he had to admit, that he had never received a package in his entire life. Sure enough, as he came out of the door, it sat there just as Blossom had said. Blossom had also told him of the shadowy figure that she thought that she had seen. He stood there eyeing the package suspiciously as his fingers ran lightly over the cut across his cheek. At first, it had seemed remarkably painful for such a light abrasion. Now, it almost seemed numb, and that was starting to concern him. It could be infected, or worse. With no healers in the area, this light wound could do some serious damage. Try as he might to push it to the back of his mind, the thought kept surfacing,   ‘What if it was poisoned?’   It was truly the most despicable of deeds, but there were assassins known to use poisoned weapons.   With his attention once more on the parcel, he reached for the stick by the door. A tool that he often used to chase off the marcots when they came out of the woods scavenging or looking for handouts from him or his patrons. He often found it had other uses. Giving the small item a shove with the staff, Tiney was satisfied that it wasn’t malevolent in nature. Being so assured, he turned his attention to the roughly scribed note.   The outside of the parchment held little more information than his name. Upon lifting it open, he discovered more of that same simple script, saying,  ‘sorry, this for cut.’  and was signed,  ‘kretook’ . Tiney recognized the name, not individually, but enough to know that it was a trog name. Suddenly, he understood the nature of his wound. He looked down at the package, realizing that it must be a cure for the poisonous secretions that trogs are rumored to ooze from their skins. “I’ll be the son of a seventh uncle!” Tiney muttered under his breath. “Huh?” questioned Blossom; she obviously was lost by all of this. Tiney carefully unwrapped the long shalla leaves that enclosed it and found a small freshwater clamshell. Opening the shell, he found a small stick, and a sticky substance that seemed to be made from roughly crushed fungus, clam, and something sort of talc or clay-like. The mixture itself seemed to slightly shimmer.   Tiney was a little hesitant at first, but finally concluded that there was no reason that anyone would try to poison him twice. Using the small applicator, he dabbed the shimmering substance along his damaged cheek. Almost at once, the numbness was replaced by a strong but pleasant tingling. He would have noticed that the tingling was subsiding if he hadn’t been distracted by the shocked look of amazement on Blossom’s face as she stepped back and choked out “H-h-how?” Taking a bucket of water from the well, and gazing at its mirrored surface, he did a double take as well. The deep, oozing cut was gone, replaced by smooth, unblemished skin.   The miraculous nature of this compound would have amazed him even more if his thoughts hadn’t jumped ahead to something even more astounding. He suddenly realized that he recognized this particular type of shellfish from experience with passing traders. This type couldn’t be found within half a days ride, and who knew where the other parts of the mixture had come from. Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to make up for what seemed was an accidental wound. Tiney would have to remember to make a point of expressing his thanks to that someone, if he ever saw him again.           Kretook had felt bad, not just because he was afraid to return to the Elw Inn. He truly regretted having hurt the innkeeper. He had been hurt before, himself. Not always physically, but he knew better than most, the feel of true suffering. The men that he had been fighting would get what they deserved, but the innkeeper was not his enemy. He did not deserve that pain.   At once, he took off through the forest, following paths that only the creatures of the wood used. When he had come of age to produce the trolp, or poison that the males of their race produced, his mother had explained what it did. She told him of the suffering, and pain that it could cause. She also told him that it should never be used upon the innocent. Of course, being realistic, his mother knew that accidents could happen, so she also taught her Kretook to prepare a cure.   Unfortunately, the items needed to create the cure had to be fresh, and none were close at hand. Kretook sprinted through the brambles and forest, gathering what he needed as he went along. He didn’t bother to stop for food, or water but continued onward night and day. He had just returned to the inn, rapidly set to combining the multitude of ingredients completing the salve, and was quickly scrawling a note, when he saw the female come from the door. With as subtle a movement as me could manage, he had slipped into the brush, and collapsed in a heap. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever be let back into the inn, but as he was drifting off, his head filled with visions of the dark haired waitress with the big, deep soulful eyes, and he smiled.            It didn’t take Jantell long to realize that things weren’t quite as they seemed. Although she couldn’t see the source of her discomfort, she could hear the source of it passing through the brush near her. Then it struck her. The odor that she had smelled was the foul scent of magic. She crouched lower than she had before, as she realized that this might not be as easy as she had first suspected. In the darkness of the forest, as in the darkness of her mind, she plotted her prey’s path. Her eyes were all but closed, while her mind was concentrating on her sense of hearing. With the silent, sliding, graceful movements of a kaweyr, she moved outward and upward to a thick branch overhanging the protected path. Laying flat along her gnarled wooden perch, she seemed to become one with the shadows of the bark. She had chosen this spot, for the big shaded gulwarf tree that towered above it. It’s cottony seedpods gently drifting downward like a million windblown feathers.   From her lofty crook in the branches, Jantell watched the drifting pods, and waited. As the raucous of breaking twigs and shuffling feet grew closer, she waited. As the downward swirls of gulwarf pods began to swirl and altered course, she waited. As she heard the labored breathing pause beneath her, she waited. Hers was the patience of the huntress.   As the stalled pods, hanging in the air beneath her turned to continue on their way, Jantell sprang. Body, knife, and mind, lunging in one swift motion; she was a deadly blur cutting through the air. Partially for sport, but also to inspire fear and confusion, she let a warrior’s cry escape her lips just before the moment of impact. Her target didn’t stand a chance. As it hit the forest floor, it rolled to face her. Only to find that ivory blade hovering where his neck would be was his neck visible. She spoke not a word; she didn’t need to… the razor sharp edge nudging at his flesh pretty much said it all.              Trendel didn’t move, he realized that was probably his only chance. Still, in the next moment it was just as likely that he would cease to exist in a quick slicing motion, and a sudden crimson blur. Worse yet, the world would go on without him, as if he had never existed. How he regretted his past; he regretted all that he was, all that he’d done, and all that he had become.   In desperation he clenched his teeth, looked up into those lucid cutting eyes that glared downward. He felt her heaving, animal body holding him down, looked upward with wide, pleading eyes, and begged, “Please, I can’t afford to die, not until I have made amends!” He was sure that this woman could render him limb from limb, and without a second thought. After all, he was in her domain now. He had never thought that he feared death. Even now, he suspected that it wasn’t death that he feared, but leaving life incomplete and with a bad reputation. It seemed to him like he was finishing off a great feast with something that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It just wasn’t the way that he wanted it all to end.   It wasn’t the act of dying at this woman’s hands that had him so upset. If anything, she was a magnificent creature to whom he would have been glad to surrender his life to. It was just that he didn’t want to go, being remembered only as being the Master’s tool.   The exquisite creature that held him pinned, pulled back so suddenly, he naturally assumed that she was going for the deathblow. Trendel closed his eyes, and prepared for the inevitable. When nothing happened, he risked a peek, just in time to see her standing over him, with a puzzled look on her face as she asked, “Why not?”   From the expression on her face, he was certain that she was not being sarcastic or playing with him. She seemed to actually want to know. As he didn’t respond right away, she repeated, “Why not? Death is just another part of life!” As simple as that, she had summed it up. Your born, you live, you die. How could he explain that there was more to it than that? There was pleasure, sorrow, disappointment, tragedy, abandonment, deception, wonder, awe, and so much more.   What would any of that possibly mean to her, a creature that lived from day to day, and her only goal survival. What would she know of ambition, treachery, or rejection; and yet… she had asked, and he was still alive. That surely counted for something.   Ever so carefully, Trendel pulled off the cloak of shadows, revealing his face, then torso, and legs. He could feel her dominating, piercing blue eyes probing through his very soul. “So little man,” she continued, “Why should I let you live?” Trendel looked straight into those cold crystal blue orbs for the first time, and said, “To learn!” The corners of her mouth turned up and her teeth briefly appeared between her lips. He wasn’t sure if it was meant to be a smile, but was too afraid to find out if it wasn’t.   “Very well, little man, you teach, I learn!” That said he felt her grab his collar one handed, and lift him airborne to his feet. “Come now, you teach!” and with that she dragged him from the safety of the trail, into the heart of her home, the deep woods. As terrified as Trendel was of those shadowed forests, all he could think was how much worse off he would have been, had he given her the wrong answer?               Maeglar trusted no one. He knew Trendel was, if not loyal, at least reliable. ‘Stump’, as he called him, held a certain pride in whatever he did, no matter how despicable a deed it might be, or whom he might be doing it for. Besides, Stump recognized true power, the protection that it could afford, and the danger that disloyalty to it could ultimately represent. That was why he was even more upset by the silence coming from the dish that was set before him. Had the amulet been damaged? Had stump befallen foul play? Was he simply not answering his master’s call? No, he knew better than that! Again he tried to contact his minion, and again he received nothing but silence in return.   Amongst the leaves and sticks along the woodland trail, on an amulet of gold, the image of Maeglar Threxx yelled, fumed, and cursed, and then finally faded into amber silence.            With the wind at his back, and the endless road to freedom, and adventure laid out before them, Andrhus Muesgroehher and his small group of followers wound their way down from Mt. Cark. They traveled onward through The Great Pass, and westward to the lowlands beyond. In addition to himself, there were four others in his group.   Svaulugh was the oldest and probably had the most experience with the outside world. He had been responsible for the most recent maps of the area around Mt. Cark, and was known to be an accomplished climber and spelunker. This dwear definitely knew the ropes, literally. He was closer to Theldhar’s age, than to Andrhus’s but cast of a totally different ore than their leader. He was outgoing, jovial, and understood that sometimes risks just had to be taken. Andrhus liked him, and was glad that he was along for the adventure. Especially since where they were going, his skills would prove invaluable.   Knurhl was much closer to Andrhus’s age as well as being one of his oldest, and closest friends. He had been chosen as the scribe and mapmaker for this expedition, as well as his ability to read, and speak several outside languages. He had spent a great deal of time in the archives with entirely too much time on his hands. In this case, that had turned out to be an asset. Besides, it was no secret that he also suffered from the ‘Dredar’ and probably wanted out from the mountain, as much if not more than Andrhus.   Klavhlok was the soldier, the small group’s soul defender. Although he had initially argued against this addition to their group, Andrhus eventually had to admit that someone with training in defense and bivouacking could come in handy. He had wanted to keep it strictly an academic expedition, free of conflict and politics. As his uncle pointed out, however, wild beasts care little for politics, and will consume explorers, and adventurers just as readily as soldiers, and warriors. So Klavhlok joined them.   Lastly, and perhaps, most objectionably was Frithch Frietz, Andrhus’s cousin and uncle Theldhar’s oldest son. Frithch’s responsibility was to be, arranging trade agreements between the Dwearen people and any outworlders that they might meet. Andrhus suspected that this was just an excuse for uncle Theldhar to keep an eye on the expedition. Especially since Frithch didn’t seem too keen on the idea of going himself. This was something that he would have to keep an eye on.   For now, though, it was their first day out, and all of their spirits were high. They all seemed to share that sense of invulnerability, which is common to all of those that are new to adventure. So excited were they to be on the road, that none of them even noticed the shadow that fleetingly passed overhead.             Theldhar looked down from the mountain, and worried. He was the leader of a whole race of people, and all of their worries were his worries. Right now, though, all of his thoughts were with the small band of travelers filing out of the valley below; and one in particular. Why? Why had he said yes? Yet he knew that he had been given no choice, not if it even remotely meant the possible return of Thremble to his people. If only Andrhus hadn’t found that journal! It had been lost for generations. Why did it have to surface now? Well, at least he had convinced Frithch to tag along and to keep an eye on the boy. He just hoped that it would be enough.   As his eyes strayed once more to the valley below, and he watched the small party filing out of the western end, he thought he saw something large, and winged slip out of the valley and towards the north. There was nothing he knew of that large. Except, well a… But that was ridiculous; they had been extinct for centuries. It was just the stress, and the worry; they were letting his eyes play tricks on him. Another pang of regret shot through him as he tried to decide which was harder, looking after his entire race of people, or his nephew. Either way, he knew that he wouldn’t sleep well that night… Then again, why should tonight be any different?              Back at the Elw Inn, Ami sat quietly in the corner, looking into the great stone fireplace. She had finished her morning chores, and being mid afternoon, the inn was fairly silent. Often, she would sit here and stare into the flames, thinking of her past. When she did that, the past filled her head, roaring up from the darkness that was a thousand yesterdays; a past, which was something that she could never talk about. They were dreams that she was too terrified to share.   As the flames reflected in her large black eyes, she wished that she could share those dreams. There was so much that she feared, but there was no one that she trusted. Her cousin, and Tiney had both been very good to her, but they would not understand; they would joke about it or they would mock her. Worse yet, they might even fear her. If only she had someone that she knew that she could trust. She had trusted her parents. She had told them of her dreams, of the fire, the pain, and the suffering, and of the death… now they were gone. No, she could trust no one, for if she did, she would risk losing him or her. In silence, she continued to stare into the fire.",6.06,7.156,5.724,0.483,0.526,78.722,13.867,0.085,0.81,0.105,6.805,10.6,4.34,2
"       THE GRAY ZONE by SEYMOUR M. HERSH How a secret Pentagon program came to Abu Ghraib. Issue of 2004-05-24 Posted 2004-05-15 The roots of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal lie not in the criminal inclinations of a few Army reservists but in a decision, approved last year by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to expand a highly secret operation, which had been focussed on the hunt for Al Qaeda, to the interrogation of prisoners in Iraq. Rumsfeld’s decision embittered the American intelligence community, damaged the effectiveness of élite combat units, and hurt America’s prospects in the war on terror.  According to interviews with several past and present American intelligence officials, the Pentagon’s operation, known inside the intelligence community by several code words, including Copper Green, encouraged physical coercion and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in an effort to generate more intelligence about the growing insurgency in Iraq. A senior C.I.A. official, in confirming the details of this account last week, said that the operation stemmed from Rumsfeld’s long-standing desire to wrest control of America’s clandestine and paramilitary operations from the C.I.A.   Rumsfeld, during appearances last week before Congress to testify about Abu Ghraib, was precluded by law from explicitly mentioning highly secret matters in an unclassified session. But he conveyed the message that he was telling the public all that he knew about the story. He said, “Any suggestion that there is not a full, deep awareness of what has happened, and the damage it has done, I think, would be a misunderstanding.” The senior C.I.A. official, asked about Rumsfeld’s testimony and that of Stephen Cambone, his Under-Secretary for Intelligence, said, “Some people think you can bullshit anyone.”  The Abu Ghraib story began, in a sense, just weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks, with the American bombing of Afghanistan. Almost from the start, the Administration’s search for Al Qaeda members in the war zone, and its worldwide search for terrorists, came up against major command-and-control problems. For example, combat forces that had Al Qaeda targets in sight had to obtain legal clearance before firing on them. On October 7th, the night the bombing began, an unmanned Predator aircraft tracked an automobile convoy that, American intelligence believed, contained Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader. A lawyer on duty at the United States Central Command headquarters, in Tampa, Florida, refused to authorize a strike. By the time an attack was approved, the target was out of reach. Rumsfeld was apoplectic over what he saw as a self-defeating hesitation to attack that was due to political correctness. One officer described him to me that fall as “kicking a lot of glass and breaking doors.” In November, the Washington Post reported that, as many as ten times since early October, Air Force pilots believed they’d had senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members in their sights but had been unable to act in time because of legalistic hurdles. There were similar problems throughout the world, as American Special Forces units seeking to move quickly against suspected terrorist cells were compelled to get prior approval from local American ambassadors and brief their superiors in the chain of command.  Rumsfeld reacted in his usual direct fashion: he authorized the establishment of a highly secret program that was given blanket advance approval to kill or capture and, if possible, interrogate “high value” targets in the Bush Administration’s war on terror. A special-access program, or sap—subject to the Defense Department’s most stringent level of security—was set up, with an office in a secure area of the Pentagon. The program would recruit operatives and acquire the necessary equipment, including aircraft, and would keep its activities under wraps. America’s most successful intelligence operations during the Cold War had been saps, including the Navy’s submarine penetration of underwater cables used by the Soviet high command and construction of the Air Force’s stealth bomber. All the so-called “black” programs had one element in common: the Secretary of Defense, or his deputy, had to conclude that the normal military classification restraints did not provide enough security.   “Rumsfeld’s goal was to get a capability in place to take on a high-value target—a standup group to hit quickly,” a former high-level intelligence official told me. “He got all the agencies together—the C.I.A. and the N.S.A.—to get pre-approval in place. Just say the code word and go.” The operation had across-the-board approval from Rumsfeld and from Condoleezza Rice, the national-security adviser. President Bush was informed of the existence of the program, the former intelligence official said.     The people assigned to the program worked by the book, the former intelligence official told me. They created code words, and recruited, after careful screening, highly trained commandos and operatives from America’s élite forces—Navy seals, the Army’s Delta Force, and the C.I.A.’s paramilitary experts. They also asked some basic questions: “Do the people working the problem have to use aliases? Yes. Do we need dead drops for the mail? Yes. No traceability and no budget. And some special-access programs are never fully briefed to Congress.”  In theory, the operation enabled the Bush Administration to respond immediately to time-sensitive intelligence: commandos crossed borders without visas and could interrogate terrorism suspects deemed too important for transfer to the military’s facilities at Guantánamo, Cuba. They carried out instant interrogations—using force if necessary—at secret C.I.A. detention centers scattered around the world. The intelligence would be relayed to the sap command center in the Pentagon in real time, and sifted for those pieces of information critical to the “white,” or overt, world.  Fewer than two hundred operatives and officials, including Rumsfeld and General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were “completely read into the program,” the former intelligence official said. The goal was to keep the operation protected. “We’re not going to read more people than necessary into our heart of darkness,” he said. “The rules are ‘Grab whom you must. Do what you want.’”  One Pentagon official who was deeply involved in the program was Stephen Cambone, who was named Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in March, 2003. The office was new; it was created as part of Rumsfeld’s reorganization of the Pentagon. Cambone was unpopular among military and civilian intelligence bureaucrats in the Pentagon, essentially because he had little experience in running intelligence programs, though in 1998 he had served as staff director for a committee, headed by Rumsfeld, that warned of an emerging ballistic-missile threat to the United States. He was known instead for his closeness to Rumsfeld. “Remember Henry II—‘Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?’” the senior C.I.A. official said to me, with a laugh, last week. “Whatever Rumsfeld whimsically says, Cambone will do ten times that much.”  Cambone was a strong advocate for war against Iraq. He shared Rumsfeld’s disdain for the analysis and assessments proffered by the C.I.A., viewing them as too cautious, and chafed, as did Rumsfeld, at the C.I.A.’s inability, before the Iraq war, to state conclusively that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction. Cambone’s military assistant, Army Lieutenant General William G. (Jerry) Boykin, was also controversial. Last fall, he generated unwanted headlines after it was reported that, in a speech at an Oregon church, he equated the Muslim world with Satan.  Early in his tenure, Cambone provoked a bureaucratic battle within the Pentagon by insisting that he be given control of all special-access programs that were relevant to the war on terror. Those programs, which had been viewed by many in the Pentagon as sacrosanct, were monitored by Kenneth deGraffenreid, who had experience in counter-intelligence programs. Cambone got control, and deGraffenreid subsequently left the Pentagon. Asked for comment on this story, a Pentagon spokesman said, “I will not discuss any covert programs; however, Dr. Cambone did not assume his position as the Under-Secretary of Defense for Intelligence until March 7, 2003, and had no involvement in the decision-making process regarding interrogation procedures in Iraq or anywhere else.”  In mid-2003, the special-access program was regarded in the Pentagon as one of the success stories of the war on terror. “It was an active program,” the former intelligence official told me. “It’s been the most important capability we have for dealing with an imminent threat. If we discover where Osama bin Laden is, we can get him. And we can remove an existing threat with a real capability to hit the United States—and do so without visibility.” Some of its methods were troubling and could not bear close scrutiny, however.   By then, the war in Iraq had begun. The sap was involved in some assignments in Iraq, the former official said. C.I.A. and other American Special Forces operatives secretly teamed up to hunt for Saddam Hussein and—without success—for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. But they weren’t able to stop the evolving insurgency.    In the first months after the fall of Baghdad, Rumsfeld and his aides still had a limited view of the insurgency, seeing it as little more than the work of Baathist “dead-enders,” criminal gangs, and foreign terrorists who were Al Qaeda followers. The Administration measured its success in the war by how many of those on its list of the fifty-five most wanted members of the old regime—reproduced on playing cards—had been captured. Then, in August, 2003, terror bombings in Baghdad hit the Jordanian Embassy, killing nineteen people, and the United Nations headquarters, killing twenty-three people, including Sergio Vieira de Mello, the head of the U.N. mission. On August 25th, less than a week after the U.N. bombing, Rumsfeld acknowledged, in a talk before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, that “the dead-enders are still with us.” He went on, “There are some today who are surprised that there are still pockets of resistance in Iraq, and they suggest that this represents some sort of failure on the part of the Coalition. But this is not the case.” Rumsfeld compared the insurgents with those true believers who “fought on during and after the defeat of the Nazi regime in Germany.” A few weeks later—and five months after the fall of Baghdad—the Defense Secretary declared,“It is, in my view, better to be dealing with terrorists in Iraq than in the United States.”  Inside the Pentagon, there was a growing realization that the war was going badly. The increasingly beleaguered and baffled Army leadership was telling reporters that the insurgents consisted of five thousand Baathists loyal to Saddam Hussein. “When you understand that they’re organized in a cellular structure,” General John Abizaid, the head of the Central Command, declared, “that . . . they have access to a lot of money and a lot of ammunition, you’ll understand how dangerous they are.”  The American military and intelligence communities were having little success in penetrating the insurgency. One internal report prepared for the U.S. military, made available to me, concluded that the insurgents’“strategic and operational intelligence has proven to be quite good.” According to the study:   Their ability to attack convoys, other vulnerable targets and particular individuals has been the result of painstaking surveillance and reconnaissance. Inside information has been passed on to insurgent cells about convoy/troop movements and daily habits of Iraqis working with coalition from within the Iraqi security services, primarily the Iraqi Police force which is rife with sympathy for the insurgents, Iraqi ministries and from within pro-insurgent individuals working with the CPA’s so-called Green Zone.    The study concluded, “Politically, the U.S. has failed to date. Insurgencies can be fixed or ameliorated by dealing with what caused them in the first place. The disaster that is the reconstruction of Iraq has been the key cause of the insurgency. There is no legitimate government, and it behooves the Coalition Provisional Authority to absorb the sad but unvarnished fact that most Iraqis do not see the Governing Council”—the Iraqi body appointed by the C.P.A.—“as the legitimate authority. Indeed, they know that the true power is the CPA.”  By the fall, a military analyst told me, the extent of the Pentagon’s political and military misjudgments was clear. Donald Rumsfeld’s “dead-enders” now included not only Baathists but many marginal figures as well—thugs and criminals who were among the tens of thousands of prisoners freed the previous fall by Saddam as part of a prewar general amnesty. Their desperation was not driving the insurgency; it simply made them easy recruits for those who were. The analyst said, “We’d killed and captured guys who had been given two or three hundred dollars to ‘pray and spray’”—that is, shoot randomly and hope for the best. “They weren’t really insurgents but down-and-outers who were paid by wealthy individuals sympathetic to the insurgency.” In many cases, the paymasters were Sunnis who had been members of the Baath Party. The analyst said that the insurgents “spent three or four months figuring out how we operated and developing their own countermeasures. If that meant putting up a hapless guy to go and attack a convoy and see how the American troops responded, they’d do it.” Then, the analyst said, “the clever ones began to get in on the action.”  By contrast, according to the military report, the American and Coalition forces knew little about the insurgency: “Human intelligence is poor or lacking . . . due to the dearth of competence and expertise. . . . The intelligence effort is not coördinated since either too many groups are involved in gathering intelligence or the final product does not get to the troops in the field in a timely manner.” The success of the war was at risk; something had to be done to change the dynamic.     The solution, endorsed by Rumsfeld and carried out by Stephen Cambone, was to get tough with those Iraqis in the Army prison system who were suspected of being insurgents. A key player was Major General Geoffrey Miller, the commander of the detention and interrogation center at Guantánamo, who had been summoned to Baghdad in late August to review prison interrogation procedures. The internal Army report on the abuse charges, written by Major General Antonio Taguba in February, revealed that Miller urged that the commanders in Baghdad change policy and place military intelligence in charge of the prison. The report quoted Miller as recommending that “detention operations must act as an enabler for interrogation.”  Miller’s concept, as it emerged in recent Senate hearings, was to “Gitmoize” the prison system in Iraq—to make it more focussed on interrogation. He also briefed military commanders in Iraq on the interrogation methods used in Cuba—methods that could, with special approval, include sleep deprivation, exposure to extremes of cold and heat, and placing prisoners in “stress positions” for agonizing lengths of time. (The Bush Administration had unilaterally declared Al Qaeda and other captured members of international terrorist networks to be illegal combatants, and not eligible for the protection of the Geneva Conventions.)   Rumsfeld and Cambone went a step further, however: they expanded the scope of the sap, bringing its unconventional methods to Abu Ghraib. The commandos were to operate in Iraq as they had in Afghanistan. The male prisoners could be treated roughly, and exposed to sexual humiliation.   “They weren’t getting anything substantive from the detainees in Iraq,” the former intelligence official told me. “No names. Nothing that they could hang their hat on. Cambone says, I’ve got to crack this thing and I’m tired of working through the normal chain of command. I’ve got this apparatus set up—the black special-access program—and I’m going in hot. So he pulls the switch, and the electricity begins flowing last summer. And it’s working. We’re getting a picture of the insurgency in Iraq and the intelligence is flowing into the white world. We’re getting good stuff. But we’ve got more targets”—prisoners in Iraqi jails—“than people who can handle them.”  Cambone then made another crucial decision, the former intelligence official told me: not only would he bring the sap’s rules into the prisons; he would bring some of the Army military-intelligence officers working inside the Iraqi prisons under the sap’s auspices. “So here are fundamentally good soldiers—military-intelligence guys—being told that no rules apply,” the former official, who has extensive knowledge of the special-access programs, added. “And, as far as they’re concerned, this is a covert operation, and it’s to be kept within Defense Department channels.”  The military-police prison guards, the former official said, included “recycled hillbillies from Cumberland, Maryland.” He was referring to members of the 372nd Military Police Company. Seven members of the company are now facing charges for their role in the abuse at Abu Ghraib. “How are these guys from Cumberland going to know anything? The Army Reserve doesn’t know what it’s doing.”  Who was in charge of Abu Ghraib—whether military police or military intelligence—was no longer the only question that mattered. Hard-core special operatives, some of them with aliases, were working in the prison. The military police assigned to guard the prisoners wore uniforms, but many others—military intelligence officers, contract interpreters, C.I.A. officers, and the men from the special-access program—wore civilian clothes. It was not clear who was who, even to Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, then the commander of the 800th Military Police Brigade, and the officer ostensibly in charge. “I thought most of the civilians there were interpreters, but there were some civilians that I didn’t know,” Karpinski told me. “I called them the disappearing ghosts. I’d seen them once in a while at Abu Ghraib and then I’d see them months later. They were nice—they’d always call out to me and say, ‘Hey, remember me? How are you doing?’” The mysterious civilians, she said, were “always bringing in somebody for interrogation or waiting to collect somebody going out.” Karpinski added that she had no idea who was operating in her prison system. (General Taguba found that Karpinski’s leadership failures contributed to the abuses.)  By fall, according to the former intelligence official, the senior leadership of the C.I.A. had had enough. “They said, ‘No way. We signed up for the core program in Afghanistan—pre-approved for operations against high-value terrorist targets—and now you want to use it for cabdrivers, brothers-in-law, and people pulled off the streets’”—the sort of prisoners who populate the Iraqi jails. “The C.I.A.’s legal people objected,” and the agency ended its sap involvement in Abu Ghraib, the former official said.   The C.I.A.’s complaints were echoed throughout the intelligence community. There was fear that the situation at Abu Ghraib would lead to the exposure of the secret sap, and thereby bring an end to what had been, before Iraq, a valuable cover operation. “This was stupidity,” a government consultant told me. “You’re taking a program that was operating in the chaos of Afghanistan against Al Qaeda, a stateless terror group, and bringing it into a structured, traditional war zone. Sooner or later, the commandos would bump into the legal and moral procedures of a conventional war with an Army of a hundred and thirty-five thousand soldiers.”  The former senior intelligence official blamed hubris for the Abu Ghraib disaster. “There’s nothing more exhilarating for a pissant Pentagon civilian than dealing with an important national security issue without dealing with military planners, who are always worried about risk,” he told me. “What could be more boring than needing the coöperation of logistical planners?” The only difficulty, the former official added, is that, “as soon as you enlarge the secret program beyond the oversight capability of experienced people, you lose control. We’ve never had a case where a special-access program went sour—and this goes back to the Cold War.”  In a separate interview, a Pentagon consultant, who spent much of his career directly involved with special-access programs, spread the blame. “The White House subcontracted this to the Pentagon, and the Pentagon subcontracted it to Cambone,” he said. “This is Cambone’s deal, but Rumsfeld and Myers approved the program.” When it came to the interrogation operation at Abu Ghraib, he said, Rumsfeld left the details to Cambone. Rumsfeld may not be personally culpable, the consultant added, “but he’s responsible for the checks and balances. The issue is that, since 9/11, we’ve changed the rules on how we deal with terrorism, and created conditions where the ends justify the means.”    Last week, statements made by one of the seven accused M.P.s, Specialist Jeremy Sivits, who is expected to plead guilty, were released. In them, he claimed that senior commanders in his unit would have stopped the abuse had they witnessed it. One of the questions that will be explored at any trial, however, is why a group of Army Reserve military policemen, most of them from small towns, tormented their prisoners as they did, in a manner that was especially humiliating for Iraqi men.   The notion that Arabs are particularly vulnerable to sexual humiliation became a talking point among pro-war Washington conservatives in the months before the March, 2003, invasion of Iraq. One book that was frequently cited was “The Arab Mind,” a study of Arab culture and psychology, first published in 1973, by Raphael Patai, a cultural anthropologist who taught at, among other universities, Columbia and Princeton, and who died in 1996. The book includes a twenty-five-page chapter on Arabs and sex, depicting sex as a taboo vested with shame and repression. “The segregation of the sexes, the veiling of the women . . . and all the other minute rules that govern and restrict contact between men and women, have the effect of making sex a prime mental preoccupation in the Arab world,” Patai wrote. Homosexual activity, “or any indication of homosexual leanings, as with all other expressions of sexuality, is never given any publicity. These are private affairs and remain in private.” The Patai book, an academic told me, was “the bible of the neocons on Arab behavior.” In their discussions, he said, two themes emerged—“one, that Arabs only understand force and, two, that the biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation.”  The government consultant said that there may have been a serious goal, in the beginning, behind the sexual humiliation and the posed photographs. It was thought that some prisoners would do anything—including spying on their associates—to avoid dissemination of the shameful photos to family and friends. The government consultant said, “I was told that the purpose of the photographs was to create an army of informants, people you could insert back in the population.” The idea was that they would be motivated by fear of exposure, and gather information about pending insurgency action, the consultant said. If so, it wasn’t effective; the insurgency continued to grow.  “This shit has been brewing for months,” the Pentagon consultant who has dealt with saps told me. “You don’t keep prisoners naked in their cell and then let them get bitten by dogs. This is sick.” The consultant explained that he and his colleagues, all of whom had served for years on active duty in the military, had been appalled by the misuse of Army guard dogs inside Abu Ghraib. “We don’t raise kids to do things like that. When you go after Mullah Omar, that’s one thing. But when you give the authority to kids who don’t know the rules, that’s another.”  In 2003, Rumsfeld’s apparent disregard for the requirements of the Geneva Conventions while carrying out the war on terror had led a group of senior military legal officers from the Judge Advocate General’s (jag) Corps to pay two surprise visits within five months to Scott Horton, who was then chairman of the New York City Bar Association’s Committee on International Human Rights. “They wanted us to challenge the Bush Administration about its standards for detentions and interrogation,” Horton told me. “They were urging us to get involved and speak in a very loud voice. It came pretty much out of the blue. The message was that conditions are ripe for abuse, and it’s going to occur.” The military officials were most alarmed about the growing use of civilian contractors in the interrogation process, Horton recalled. “They said there was an atmosphere of legal ambiguity being created as a result of a policy decision at the highest levels in the Pentagon. The jag officers were being cut out of the policy formulation process.” They told him that, with the war on terror, a fifty-year history of exemplary application of the Geneva Conventions had come to an end.    The abuses at Abu Ghraib were exposed on January 13th, when Joseph Darby, a young military policeman assigned to Abu Ghraib, reported the wrongdoing to the Army’s Criminal Investigations Division. He also turned over a CD full of photographs. Within three days, a report made its way to Donald Rumsfeld, who informed President Bush.   The inquiry presented a dilemma for the Pentagon. The C.I.D. had to be allowed to continue, the former intelligence official said. “You can’t cover it up. You have to prosecute these guys for being off the reservation. But how do you prosecute them when they were covered by the special-access program? So you hope that maybe it’ll go away.” The Pentagon’s attitude last January, he said, was “Somebody got caught with some photos. What’s the big deal? Take care of it.” Rumsfeld’s explanation to the White House, the official added, was reassuring: “‘We’ve got a glitch in the program. We’ll prosecute it.’ The cover story was that some kids got out of control.”  In their testimony before Congress last week, Rumsfeld and Cambone struggled to convince the legislators that Miller’s visit to Baghdad in late August had nothing to do with the subsequent abuse. Cambone sought to assure the Senate Armed Services Committee that the interplay between Miller and Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, had only a casual connection to his office. Miller’s recommendations, Cambone said, were made to Sanchez. His own role, he said, was mainly to insure that the “flow of intelligence back to the commands” was “efficient and effective.” He added that Miller’s goal was “to provide a safe, secure and humane environment that supports the expeditious collection of intelligence.”  It was a hard sell. Senator Hillary Clinton, Democrat of New York, posed the essential question facing the senators:   If, indeed, General Miller was sent from Guantánamo to Iraq for the purpose of acquiring more actionable intelligence from detainees, then it is fair to conclude that the actions that are at point here in your report [on abuses at Abu Ghraib] are in some way connected to General Miller’s arrival and his specific orders, however they were interpreted, by those MPs and the military intelligence that were involved.. . .Therefore, I for one don’t believe I yet have adequate information from Mr. Cambone and the Defense Department as to exactly what General Miller’s orders were . . . how he carried out those orders, and the connection between his arrival in the fall of ’03 and the intensity of the abuses that occurred afterward.    Sometime before the Abu Ghraib abuses became public, the former intelligence official told me, Miller was “read in”—that is, briefed—on the special-access operation. In April, Miller returned to Baghdad to assume control of the Iraqi prisons; once the scandal hit, with its glaring headlines, General Sanchez presented him to the American and international media as the general who would clean up the Iraqi prison system and instill respect for the Geneva Conventions. “His job is to save what he can,” the former official said. “He’s there to protect the program while limiting any loss of core capability.” As for Antonio Taguba, the former intelligence official added, “He goes into it not knowing shit. And then: ‘Holy cow! What’s going on?’”  If General Miller had been summoned by Congress to testify, he, like Rumsfeld and Cambone, would not have been able to mention the special-access program. “If you give away the fact that a special-access program exists,”the former intelligence official told me, “you blow the whole quick-reaction program.”  One puzzling aspect of Rumsfeld’s account of his initial reaction to news of the Abu Ghraib investigation was his lack of alarm and lack of curiosity. One factor may have been recent history: there had been many previous complaints of prisoner abuse from organization like Human Rights Watch and the International Red Cross, and the Pentagon had weathered them with ease. Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he had not been provided with details of alleged abuses until late March, when he read the specific charges. “You read it, as I say, it’s one thing. You see these photographs and it’s just unbelievable. . . . It wasn’t three-dimensional. It wasn’t video. It wasn’t color. It was quite a different thing.” The former intelligence official said that, in his view, Rumsfeld and other senior Pentagon officials had not studied the photographs because “they thought what was in there was permitted under the rules of engagement,” as applied to the sap. “The photos,” he added, “turned out to be the result of the program run amok.”  The former intelligence official made it clear that he was not alleging that Rumsfeld or General Myers knew that atrocities were committed. But, he said, “it was their permission granted to do the sap, generically, and there was enough ambiguity, which permitted the abuses.”  This official went on, “The black guys”—those in the Pentagon’s secret program—“say we’ve got to accept the prosecution. They’re vaccinated from the reality.” The sap is still active, and “the United States is picking up guys for interrogation. The question is, how do they protect the quick-reaction force without blowing its cover?” The program was protected by the fact that no one on the outside was allowed to know of its existence. “If you even give a hint that you’re aware of a black program that you’re not read into, you lose your clearances,” the former official said. “Nobody will talk. So the only people left to prosecute are those who are undefended—the poor kids at the end of the food chain.”  The most vulnerable senior official is Cambone. “The Pentagon is trying now to protect Cambone, and doesn’t know how to do it,” the former intelligence official said.    Last week, the government consultant, who has close ties to many conservatives, defended the Administration’s continued secrecy about the special-access program in Abu Ghraib. “Why keep it black?” the consultant asked. “Because the process is unpleasant. It’s like making sausage—you like the result but you don’t want to know how it was made. Also, you don’t want the Iraqi public, and the Arab world, to know. Remember, we went to Iraq to democratize the Middle East. The last thing you want to do is let the Arab world know how you treat Arab males in prison.”  The former intelligence official told me he feared that one of the disastrous effects of the prison-abuse scandal would be the undermining of legitimate operations in the war on terror, which had already suffered from the draining of resources into Iraq. He portrayed Abu Ghraib as “a tumor” on the war on terror. He said, “As long as it’s benign and contained, the Pentagon can deal with the photo crisis without jeopardizing the secret program. As soon as it begins to grow, with nobody to diagnose it—it becomes a malignant tumor.”  The Pentagon consultant made a similar point. Cambone and his superiors, the consultant said, “created the conditions that allowed transgressions to take place. And now we’re going to end up with another Church Commission”—the 1975 Senate committee on intelligence, headed by Senator Frank Church, of Idaho, which investigated C.I.A. abuses during the previous two decades. Abu Ghraib had sent the message that the Pentagon leadership was unable to handle its discretionary power. “When the shit hits the fan, as it did on 9/11, how do you push the pedal?” the consultant asked. “You do it selectively and with intelligence.”  “Congress is going to get to the bottom of this,” the Pentagon consultant said. “You have to demonstrate that there are checks and balances in the system.” He added, “When you live in a world of gray zones, you have to have very clear red lines.”  Senator John McCain, of Arizona, said, “If this is true, it certainly increases the dimension of this issue and deserves significant scrutiny. I will do all possible to get to the bottom of this, and all other allegations.”  “In an odd way,” Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, said, “the sexual abuses at Abu Ghraib have become a diversion for the prisoner abuse and the violation of the Geneva Conventions that is authorized.” Since September 11th, Roth added, the military has systematically used third-degree techniques around the world on detainees. “Some jags hate this and are horrified that the tolerance of mistreatment will come back and haunt us in the next war,” Roth told me. “We’re giving the world a ready-made excuse to ignore the Geneva Conventions. Rumsfeld has lowered the bar.”           ",11.212,10.581,10.822,0.648,0.543,51.91,19.333,0.102,0.849,0.049,12.812,13.78,5.018,2
"           “Sir?” “Yes, Coco, what is it?” “Necco is on line two, would you like me to put him through?”  Necco, finally! “Yes, thank you…oh and Coco…hold all my other calls.” “Yes Sir.”   A cruel smirk formed on Dee’s lips, he was so close he could taste it! Unconsciously, he began to smooth the creased leather on the arm of his executive chair as he grew minutely excited.  Necco would have an answer for him today, he thought, that he would.  In a smooth fluid movement, he adjusted his earpiece and microphone, and then leaned forward to connect to the call.  “Necco, tell me you’re calling with good news….or give me a good reason not to fire you.” “Whoa, whoa, whoa Mista K, ease up.  You know I’m your man.  The shipment just came in and I’m working the closing shift tonight at the Pussycat.  W-w-will you be by at your usual time?” The yearning in Necco’s voice excited him.  There was a time when Necco didn’t like to play his games, now it seems like he could not rid himself of the little welp.  “Only if you’re good, will you be good?” The momentary silence on the other end of the line told him that Necco was struggling mentally with his feelings.  He was both delighted and repulsed by what he felt when they were together…playing the game.  “Y-yes, s-sir,” he answered in a defeated whisper.  “Good boy, I shall see you at 6 then.”  “M-mister K, I-I jus--” *click* Dee quickly disconnected the call as he had no time for Necco’s inarticulate words of affection; he had things to do before he could enjoy the evening’s festivities.  Dee turned in his chair and faced the window of his corner office; the view was chaotic. It faced 45th Street and Park Avenue, which was a jumbled disarray of people, traffic and coffee carts.  He despised the city’s disorganization, its haphazard way of functioning.  He preferred things orderly, arranged and systematic.  Dee, born Delicioso Kandemhan, a joke of a first name given to him by his Spanish mother, had started at the company when he was 21 as an intern.  At the time the company name had been Ce & Ce Candy Co., owned by Cecil and Celeste Marzipan who had began as confectioners nearly 40 years before Dee arrived on the scene.  It had been advantageous of him to meet both of them at a company function where they took to him instantly.  After his initial period as an intern, he worked directly for Cecil and Celeste as an assistant, subsequently working his way to where he was today—an owning partner at what was now called Ce & De Candy Confectioners.  With his perseverance he had pushed the company from being the makers of a handful of different kinds of sugarcoated items to a corporation that included thousands of varieties of candies, from the exotic to the nostalgic as well as beverages and pastries.  Now here he was, 15 years later, in a position of power; a place he knew he’d always be.   “Sir,” Coco’s voice rose from the intercom and seemed to wrap around his lower body like a soft fur blanket.  Dee frowned, not liking that he had no control over his body when it came to Coco.  This was one of the reasons he never made any attempt to include her into his circle of sexual friends.  “Yes, Coco, what is it?” He barked impatiently. “You asked me to remind you about your appointment with your trainer.” Coco’s voice was cool and neutral and he wondered if he had hurt her feelings, just the thought that he may have broke through her cool demeanor excited him to the point where he almost asked her to come into his office. “Thank you Coco, I was just about to leave.  I’ll be reachable by Blackberry.” “Yes sir.”  Dee grabbed up his gym bag and walked determinedly past Coco towards his private elevator without as much as a sideways glance.  Coco watched him leave.  She stared at his tall, slim frame as it confidently strode into the elevator.  Damn he’s fine, Coco thought, no man should be that damned pretty.    She could still remember the day she interviewed for the position here; she truly thought she had no chance in hell in getting it.  There had been about 12 other women in the room that day to interview with Mr. Kandemhan, all white and she, the only black latina.  She overheard that some of the women even had MBA’s, Coco only had an Associates degree from the local community college; she couldn’t compete.  She was ready to leave when a coolly detached voice came over the intercom, “Ms. Villanueva, please come in.”  Coco started towards the oak wood double doors, wondering how the person who had called her in could pronounce her name perfectly, distinctly.  She even had trouble pronouncing it some days. She stepped into what she thought was the most unusual outer office she’d ever seen.  It was circular shaped furnished with only a huge circular cherry wood desk and high back leather chair.  A diminutive elderly woman sat at the desk and without a word pointed to the double doors behind her.  Coco continued on through the second set of double doors, faintly smiling at the woman as she past her.    Stepping through the doors, Coco’s mouth almost fell as she took in the huge two-level office that seemed bigger than her entire Bronx apartment.  A tall slim man stood looking out of the ceiling to floor windows that took over an entire back wall of the office.  The office itself was fastidiously ordered, there was a place for everything and everything was in its place. She studied the man’s appearance a moment longer before walking towards the enormous leather covered desk.  He wore his hair long, bound by what looked like a leather strap into a neat ponytail and his skin, what she could see of it, looked as if it had been kissed by the sun.  “Good morning Mr. Kandemhan, I’m--” He turned swiftly towards her and held his forefinger out to silence her.  “Absolutely Cecil, I’ll be there tonight, yes…yes… wonderful…send my love to Celeste, ciao.” Mr. Kandemhan turned his attention to Coco and she suddenly wished she had walked out on the interview.  Staring into her soft brown eyes were the coldest looking black eyes she’d ever seen, she could swear he looked at her with contempt.  But then he spoke, his voice seemed hot and cold at the same time; making Coco think of things she shouldn’t, like how would this man look naked.  I can’t work here, she thought, I’d end up doing my boss and that ain’t good.  “Ms. Villanueva, it’s a pleasure.  Please sit,” he said, motioning to the large overstuffed leather chair in front of his desk.  She placed her resume on his desk then sat down.  She had worn her best cream suit because it brought out her caramel coloring and flattered her curvaceous form.  Her dark long curls were wrapped in a tight professional bun showing off her long neck.  Before she walked in this office she felt as beautiful as a swan, now she felt like prey.  “Ms. Villanueva, I won’t kid you about this position, it’s very demanding.  I require more than usual from my assistants,” He paused, looking directly into her eyes and asked, “What can you offer that the others cannot?”  Coco could feel the blush creep up on her face; she’d been watching his full lips annunciate every letter of every word he spoke and didn’t believe he would turn his almond-shaped eyes up to look at her again. She was speechless, his request almost sounded sexual. Taking a moment to think about it, she decided to just be honest, besides she wasn’t getting the job anyway.  “Other than making sure you’ve bathed, there’s no particular task that I can’t do,” swallowing hard she continued, “as you can see from my resume, I type 65 – 70 words per minute, am familiar with all PC and MAC software as well as 3 different type of accounting software.  I am professional, detail oriented and very well organized.  I believe given the opportunity to work for you, I would become an essential part of your company.” Her speech delivered, she inhaled, and then exhaled.  “And?” He asked, slightly smirking.   “Umm and Mr. Kandemhan?” She replied, stumped. “Yes, Ms. Villanueva, and?  What else can you offer me? This position pays $65,000 annually plus benefits and bonuses.  I’m going to need a little more than an average glorified executive assistant; this person would be an extension of me, representing me in my absence.  So I reiterate, Ms. Villanueva, what else can you offer me?”  OH NO HE DIDN’T!! Coco thought. He did NOT just call me average! I’ll tell you what I can offer you, you damned prick, how about a little color up in this company!! You got like two black people in this building and that INCLUDES me and the janitor!! Coco couldn’t believe how much she wanted to smack this man’s hateful smirk of his gorgeous lips.  She took a deep breath then spoke.  “Mr. Kandemhan, I can do what the position requires and if there’s something I can’t do, I’ll learn.  Other than that, I don’t know what else I can offer.”  “Hhmm, I see.  Thank you, Ms. Villanueva that will be all.  Please show yourself out.” He had dismissed her.  Just like that.  Coco stood, reached over the desk and shook his soft hand, then turned and walked out of the office with her head held high.  She was too damned proud to cry until she got on the train home.  When Coco did get home she was completely taken aback to find a message from him waiting for her on her machine.  His distinctly clipped voice stating, “Congratulations Ms. Villanueva, you start Thursday.  Be sure to get in contact with the Human Resource office to fill out the necessary paperwork.”  Now here she was, two and a half years later, still working for a man who spoke to her as if she were a bad taste in his mouth he could not spit out fast enough.  But, now she’s paid $70,000 plus bonuses and as long as she was getting paid, he could talk to her as if she were the devil himself, she didn’t care.  The only thing she didn’t like was how her body responded to him when he lashed out on her.  No man should be that damned pretty.  *****************   Dee had just finished his daily power workout with Wrigley, his personal trainer.  He decided to hit the private steam room before he went back to the office to meet with Mr. Cadbury, his company’s chemist, about a project they were working on.  Although the workout was extremely rigorous, it had not squelched the seed of desire that had begun in his office.  Damn it all to HELL!  Dee thought I’m in control, no one else just me! I just have to work this thing out of my system. What he needed was a quick fix to put him back on top.  Dee looked up at a sound he heard near the entrance of the steam room and smiled.  At the door, already on all fours like a good little girl was Ginger.  She was the beautiful redhead who worked the reception area, handing out towels, t-shirts and locks to members of the exclusive gym.  Dee leaned his well-formed body against the smooth porcelain ledge of the steam room seat and sneered at her.   “Little girl, little girl, why are you here?” Dee asked in a singsong manner.  Ginger crawled forward several steps and answered in the same way, “To relish in the pain that will bring you good cheer.”  The sneer on Dee’s face turned into a radiate grin, his teeth bared in a savage manner. “Little girl, little girl, wouldn’t you want some?” Ginger closed the distance between them until finally she was kneeling between his legs, wearing nothing but an open robe and holding out a rider’s crop. “My cheer will begin when my pain makes you cum.”  His grin was now maliciously beatific; Dee grabbed the rider’s crop out of Ginger’s hand and whipped her soundly across her small pert breasts.  “Uuhh,” Ginger grunted.  And as an angry red mark welted up on her milky white skin, Dee realized that the crop had already been salted.  Perfect.   ******************  Just as Dee walked into the office building, his Blackberry went off.    ***Sir, Mr. Cadbury has arrived for your afternoon appointment, Coco***  He ran his thumb along the LCD screen over Coco’s name.  FUCK!  I thought I worked this out of my system already.  He gripped his Blackberry, erased the message and threw it in his gym bag.    As he stepped off the elevator he couldn’t resist taking a quick glance at Coco.  She sat behind the monstrous desk like a queen, regal, beautiful and dangerous.  She stared intently at her monitor as she softly chewed on the licorice whip that was hanging seductively from the corner of her lips.  It was the Ce & De brand of licorice, which she took extreme liking to and it seemed to be the only thing he ever saw her eat.  Dee stood frozen in the doorway, looking at the scene.  In an attempt to get a handle on his feelings; he gave himself, especially his erection, a mental and physical shake, and walked purposely towards her.  “Coco, has Mr. Cadbury been waiting very long?” Coco jumped.  “Oh god!  Mr. Kandemhan, I didn’t see you there.  You scared me!” she said, a little shakily.   “Hhmm, I see. Did you at least offer Mr. Cadbury some sort of refreshment?” Coco looked directly up at Dee with cool indifference. “Sir,” she said pointedly, “when have I ever left a guest unattended?”  Dee wanted to grab her delicate face and squeezed it between his fingers until she whimpered, but at that moment Mr. Cadbury decided to pop his head out of Dee’s office.   “Kandemhan! Hey buddy, you planning on keeping me waiting all day?” Mr. Cadbury’s chipper mood did nothing to break the heated tension between Dee and Coco. “We will discuss this later Coco.” “Yes sir,” she said, dismissing him as quickly as he had dismissed her.  Stepping into his office with Mr. Cadbury following him, Dee was seething.  “Cadbury, where are we on the projects?” Dee asked, barely allowing his chemist to sit down before interrogating him.  “You know, Dee, you really ought to ease up on that girl.  She’s one of the few assistants you’ve had that has lasted this long….and she’s cute to boot!!”  Dee allowed very few people to address him using his first name and Cadbury wasn’t one of them, however he was too intent on getting his hands on the projects Cadbury was working on to bother correcting him.  “Mr. Cadbury, I’d appreciate it if you let me handle my own affairs. Now, show me what you have.”  Mr. Cadbury opened the box he had brought with him and pulled out two objects.  The first was seven or so licorice whips.  However, instead of the normal seven-inch straps, these were three feet long and entirely corded with braided licorice laces. It gave the sweet, distinctively flavored root a bit more girth and weight.  The other was a special treat for Necco.  Dee had gotten it made for him knowing he would protest in Dee using it on him.    “Cadbury, you are a genius! I knew there was a reason I kept you around.” “I’m here to serve Dee, erm Kandemhan.” Cadbury quickly corrected himself when Dee threw him an abhorrent glare. “Do you have anything on the handle yet?” He asked.  “Not yet,” said Dee, “however, I will be meeting with a colleague tonight who, as we speak, has the mold for it.  This will be a masterpiece!”  Cadbury simply nodded, he really didn’t care for Kandemhan’s ‘collection’.  He had done several of these types of jobs for him in the past, however this one seemed different.  Kandemhan had been incessant about getting this ‘project’ together quickly.    Cadbury stood up, looking at his watch, “Kandemhan, if you don’t mind, I really have to get going.  Let me know when you want me to start working on the handle, okay?”  Dee, who wasn’t even listening to him, merely nodded; completely submerge in his projects.  “By the way,” Cadbury whispered, “do you happen to know if Coco’s single?”  At the mention of Coco’s name Dee looked up at Cadbury and asked, “What?” “If she’s single…a good looking woman like her may be taken, I wanted to know if you knew of any men in her life.  I’m thinking of asking her out.” Cadbury smiled at Dee, that knowing smile men give each other about women.  “You will do nothing of the sort; keep your mind on the business at hand Cadbury, not on my business!” Dee spat, so angry that anyone would dare suggest such a thing.  Cadbury quickly apologized, “Geez, Dee, erm, uhh I mean Kandemhan, I’m sorry.  I had NO IDEA you two were an item.  I would never--”  “Leave, Cadbury.  You’ve overstayed your welcome.”  Cadbury stood, openmouthed, looking at Kandemhan a moment longer then turned and walked towards the double doors.  As he was about to close the door behind him, Kandemhan threw back, “Be ready tomorrow, I will obtain the handle mold tonight.  I want this project completed by tomorrow at end of business day.” Cadbury nodded, not even looking back and silently walked out.  ****************  That was it, Coco thought, sitting at her computer simultaneously writing her resignation letter, which she was planning on sending Mr. Kandemhan via his precious Blackberry, and putting her resume out on every online job board she could find.  She could take being talked down upon but not questioning the way she did her job.  She had never given him any reason to think that she couldn’t do her duties.  Well let’s see what he thinks when he doesn’t find her here in the morning.  Coco had just finished gathering her things when the doors to Kandemhan’s office opened.  She looked up and saw Mr. Cadbury; he walked past her barely giving her a nod goodbye.  She had never seen him look so stressed before; he always seemed easygoing and good-natured.  Her boss must have said something really nasty to wipe a smile off of a nice man like that.  Anyway, she thought, not my problem anymore.  I got enough money saved and I own my apartment now, so fuck him! Coco put on her sweater and her headphones and walked out of her circular office.  As she stepped out of the building, she felt slightly dejected as if she would miss something.  It’s just the money talking, Coco laughed to herself; it’s just the money.  ***************  Dee gathered up the projects in his briefcase and picked up his gym bag as he headed out of his office.  He had to see Necco to get the template for the ‘project’.  As he walked out, he began barking orders towards Coco’s direction for the next day’s agenda when he noticed she wasn’t answering.  He looked up to see her desk was empty and immaculately ordered.  She must have left for the day, he thought.  Dee frowned; he felt unsatisfied for some reason but shook it off to think about the evening’s entertainment.  Dee stepped onto his private elevator and as the doors closed he looked one last time at Coco’s desk.  Something was amiss but he couldn’t put his finger on it.  The doors of the elevator closed leaving Dee with a foreboding feeling that nagged him long after he left the building.  ****************  Necco nervously looked through the store window again.  He’s late, thought Necco dejectedly, he probably ain’t even coming.  As he turned away from the door he heard three sharp taps on the glass.  Necco quickly turned back to see Mr. Kandemhan standing outside.  He opened the door almost relieved, “Hey Mista K., I thought, well I thought you weren’t gonna make it.”    “Don’t be ridiculous Necco, did I not say I would?” Dee smiled at Necco. “You were very good to wait my little Necco, very good.”   Necco felt his heart beat faster as Dee spoke to him.  He had never been with another man before Kandehman and technically he still hasn’t “been with a man.”  Necco wasn’t allowed to touch him but Kandehman could most definitely touch him.  He wasn’t gay or nothing but Kandehman had this way of making Necco do anything he wanted.  “Do you have it, Necco?” “U-u-hh yea, it’s in the back, this way.”  Necco lead the way to the storage area of the Pink Pussycat.  The storage room was filled with open boxes of inventory that had yet to be put away.  On a tall white table in the middle of the room, there were two kangaroo leather Cat O’ Nine whips and a molding cast for the whip’s handle.  Each Nine had a herringbone handle with about seven flat braided cats.    Dee admired the beauty of the Nines, you simply cannot get anything better than kangaroo leather, he thought.    “Are these for me, my little Necco?” “Y-yea, I thought you might like `em.” “And this is the casting mold for the handle, correct?” “Yea, of course there’s no charge Mista K., cuz, you know, we’re tight like that.” Necco was looking down; he couldn’t look Kandehman in the eyes when he called him his ‘little Necco’.  When he did; he would get a killer hard on and then he’d feel …dirty but in a good way, that kind of jeans-tight-around-the-crotch dirty but good way.   “Hhmm, indeed we are, my little Necco.  These nines are truly fine specimens.  I will have to try them out soon,” he said pointedly.  Necco got nervous; he didn’t want to be whipped today.  Not here.  He looked at Kandehman, wide-eyed as if pleading with him to understand but not verbally refusing.  “Don’t worry Necco, I’ve got something else in mind for you tonight,” he said, opening his briefcase and taking out project #2.  It was a lollipop spinner.  A battery operated machine used to spin a lollipop in a child’s mouth, except this one was slightly different.  Dee had asked Cadbury to modify the toy so that it could hold a larger stemmed pop and spin it at different levels.  The one it currently held was a large version of a Charm’s lollipop.  Dee pushed a button and the bulbous head of the pop spun around slowly.   “It’s a gift I had made for you, my little Necco.  Now what do you say?” “U-u-hh, look Mista K., I’m into electro-stimulating but not this kind.  We’ve never done anything that actually…uuhh, you know….penetrated.”  The way Dee looked down at him, Necco thought Dee would hate him and he couldn’t take it. “B-but, h-hey I’ll try anything once, three times if it feels good!” Necco joked. “That’s my good little boy,” said Dee as he reached into one of the open boxes and pulled out a small bottle of AstroGlide.   “Now, let’s see how well it works, shall we?”  ****************  An hour and a half later, Dee was back in his chauffeured car.  Project #2 was surprisingly pleasing, he’d have to thank Cadbury, he thought.  Oh hell, might as well send him a quick message.  Dee rummaged through his gym bag and retrieved his Blackberry.  There was a message from Coco, which had been sent hours ago.    ***Dear Mr. Kandehman, Due to reasons that are painfully obvious, I regret to inform you that I am resigning from this position as of today.  I wish you well. Sincerely, Coco Villanueva***  Dee anger knew no bounds; it rose rapidly up his body like a flood and crashed into him over and over.  How DARE she leave him? Well, he planned to fix this situation immediately.  “Driver, I’ve changed my mind.  Take me to 30 Bogardus Place.  It’s in the Heights.”  I refuse to let you go Coco, he thought, you’re mine.  **************  On the way to Coco’s house, Dee sent a Blackberry message to Cadbury.  He wanted him to meet him and pick up the molding cast and licorice whips and then get his final ‘project’ done this evening.  When Dee’s car pulled up to Coco’s building, Cadbury was already there. Dee handed off the items to him.  “I’d like you to deliver it here to me.” “Here?! At Coco’s place?!” “What part of my statement did you not understand Cadbury?” Cadbury sighed and nodded, “I should be done within 2 hours, give or take a few minutes, Sir.” “Very good, the apartment number is 5-A, I’ll be expecting you soon.” And with that Dee stepped into the building corridor.  He looked for her buzzer then pressed it, three sharp taps. Seconds later, her voice rose through the intercom, “Who is it?” Her voice alone incited and excited him.  “It’s Mr. Kandehman, I received your ‘letter’ of resignation and I wanted to talk to you about it, Ms. Villanueva.”  There was a long pause then she spoke again. “Okay, come up.”  The door buzzed and Dee stepped through.  The building was a renovated prewar which meant it now had elevators.  As Dee rode up he wondered what he would tell her.  His attraction for her was the main reason he hired her and was the only reason he kept her this long.  The doors opened up on the fifth floor and Dee stepped out.  He looked down the hall and saw Coco standing outside her door in a cream terrycloth robe.  “Mr. Kandehman,” she started as Dee closed the distance between them. “I was going to call you and fully explain in the morning.” “I’d prefer if we spoke in private Coco, not in the hallway of your building,” he said warmly.  Coco felt flustered; he had never spoken that way to her before.  Maybe he came to apologize, she thought. “Of course, Mr. Kandehman; please, come in.”  Inside Coco’s apartment Dee began to feel his excitement growing.  With every step he took into the pleasantly color Co-Op, he grew harder and harder.   “Mr. Kandehman, would you like something to drink?” “Why, yes thank you Coco, water will do. And please, call me Dee.” He smiled.  Coco stood absolutely still for a moment looking at him smile.  She once again got the feeling that she was being preyed upon.  His smile looked, felt and smelt dangerous. “O-of course M-Mi..umm Dee.”  Coco brought Dee water and sat opposite of him in her living room.  This was her place, she thought, he couldn’t tell her what to do here.  Dee could see several emotions passing Coco’s face. Delicious, he thought.  She may not be his employee any longer, but he planned to make her an offer he felt she would not refuse.    “Coco, I understand why you resigned, truly I do.  I’m a very difficult person to work for.”  “Well, there is that, Mr. Ka…umm Dee.  But it had a lot to do with you doubting my abilities”  Dee’s concentration was completely on the deep V of Coco’s robe.  She is very buxom isn’t she? He thought.  He’s never had buxom before, only waif.  “…and not to mention domineering!” “Hhmm what?” Dee asked. “Are you even listening to me, or are you just wasting my time? Because you can leave right now!” Coco was furious.  Not only at this man but at the way her body’s had been reacting since he arrived.    “Coco, I will not apologize for anything I’ve said or done because I don’t believe I was wrong, however, I’m willing to make you an offer I think you’d like.”  He’s probably going to offer me more money, she thought.  “I’m listening.” It infuriated him that as short as she was, she could look down at him, HIM!  “I’ll act as if you never resigned, bump your salary up to $80,000 and add 20 days vacation to your time, not to mention annual discretionary bonuses.”  Coco sat there openmouthed.  What the FUCK?! She thought; that was one hell of an apology!  “If,” Coco asked.  There had to be an ‘If’ somewhere in there, she thought. “If…” Dee said, what do I want, he thought.  I want you, Coco.  He couldn’t say that. “If you would do some things for me.”   “Like what,” Coco asked suspiciously. “Cadbury is on his way here with something I had him make.  I’d like you to be the keeper of this thing and use it when I say and on whom I say.  Can you agree to that?” “But what is it? I can’t just say yes without knowing.  What if I don’t know how to use it?” “Oh my little Coco, I’m positive that you know how to use it.” With that Dee got up and offered a hand to Coco so that she stood in front of him.  “What do you have on under this robe, my little Coco?” “I-I d-don’t understand--” “Oh, but you do,” he said as he slipped a hand beneath the robe to feel the strap of her bra that he noticed earlier.  MMmm leather, nice he thought. Coco was so excited she couldn’t breathe.  She had never in her life been topped!  She had always been the one on top, but Dee made her want to try new things.  Just then the doorbell rang.  “D-Dee,” she breathed and looked questioningly at him. “It must be Cadbury, shall we let him in?” He whispered.   Dee let Coco answer the door.  Cadbury walked in, obviously uncomfortable with the fact that he may have interrupted something.  “Ah Cadbury, good to see you again,” Dee said, grinning mischievously. “Show us what you have there.”  Cadbury’s mouth fell open then snapped shut.  He looked at Coco who looked confused but interested and decided to open the box he was carrying.  From inside, he pulled out a black and red Cat O’ Nine.  Coco walked up to get a closer look.  The entire whip was made of licorice.  Beautifully crafted for pleasure and pain.  She looked up at Dee questioningly and he smiled wickedly at her as he nodded for her to pick up the whip.  Coco grabbed the handle, it felt like the real thing, she thought, and she began to feel a hot wetness gather between her legs.  She wanted to use it, but not on Dee…on someone weak.  She looked up again at Dee, letting him know she was ready.  Dee turned his attention to Cadbury.  “Well done Cadbury, well done.  Do you mind if we give it a go?”  “Whatever rocks your socks, Kandehman.” Cadbury replied. Dee looked at Coco and watched as she lifted the whip and cracked it down across Cadbury’s clothed ass.  “WHAT THE FUCK?! YOU BITCH!! NOT ON ME!” Cadbury screamed.  Coco mirrored Dee’s smile and brought the whip down again.  “Kandehman, stop this,” Cadbury pleaded.  “Cadbury, you of all people should truly enjoy this.  I know I’ve neglected you for a time, but since you’ve been so very good; you simply must be rewarded!”   Cadbury hung his head down defeated and gave Dee a weak, “Yes sir.” Dee nodded at Coco and she stepped forward again with the whip.  “Can I make him do anything I want?” She asked sweetly, caressing the handle of the whip.    “Oh yes, my little Coco, ANYTHING you want!” Dee smiled.  ****************  “WHO?” Coco demanded as she repeatedly whipped Cadbury, “WHO CAN?”  “T-t-he Cc-candyman..c-can,” Cadbury grunted.  “WHY?” “b-b-because…” he panted, “h-he m-mixes it w-with l-love a-and makes t-the w-world taste g-good!…PLEASE STOP!” Cadbury begged and fainted away on Coco’s floor.  Coco smiled and turned.  Dee had been watching all this time and his erection looked as if it would burst out of his pants.  She walked towards him with her robe open revealing her patent leather clad lingerie and asked, “Is he right? Does the Candyman really make the world taste good?”  “That he does, my little Coco,” Dee replied as he watched Coco slip the tip on one of the licorice whips into her mouth, “that he does.”                 ",4.825,6.076,5.934,0.517,0.581,75.142,12.7,0.044,0.89,0.066,8.262,9.98,4.232,2
"   With the Scylding’s Heart    Lord Belheris, God of the Silver-Tongue, bid my humble prayer to pass, written as it is in this imperfect hand of mine own and with a quill that threatens to fail me. Blessed have you made your bards, with the gift of song and story, traveling far throughout the lands to please commoner and king alike. Because of you, Mighty Lord, twinned all the other Gods who have deigned to grace me with their divine favor, my name has been given a greatness the likes of which I have only seen of the heroes of old. Oft have I heard my name carried in long bardic lays that flow from great halls, through public houses, and along the steady rows of soldiers’ tents as they wait out the night before battle. I am even told how at the mention of my name, hope comes to the hearts of the lost, and in battle cries of it rally troops and send the enemy fleeing in terror.   Holy Lord, Most Noble Gods, I, Tanwin Scathach, mother, daughter, sister, soldier, and wife, most humbly beg you to bless me with your art, if only for a time. Grant me that I might tell my own tale, of my own life, as I have lived it, in the hopes that those that I love dearly might learn the truth of it all. For I fear I am becoming a legend, and legends have a life of their own with a light that shines so brightly that a person might be lost within it. So I beseech you, let me tell mine own tale.  For those who might read this, I will admit that though I can be a teller of tales in a pinch, I am no bard, and inscribing tales to parchment is another animal completely, one I am not so sure I can tame. So I ask of you this, especially of my own children and husband to whom I devote this work, have patience with me. Have patience and all shall turn out well in the end.  As with all stories and all legends there is a beginning, heroes being born or sallying out into the world to accomplish marvelous tasks and the like. As for me, though, I shall not start there, for there is another tale unto itself and would only belabor an already difficult task such as this. Instead I shall start in a place far more important to me, in a time and with a peoples that I will say made me who I am. I will say now that my tale is thus: I was ten when I encountered my first battle, face-front and full of blood, but I was no neophyte to arms, for raised in the Citadel of the Scylding, though I was not one, I carried the heart of one, and went roaring into the fight without fear, much to the dismay of my elders, most notably my uncle!  Let me start instead at another beginning, one of explanations, for I fear that I must give them as that so much can get muddled in legend. Bards are good people, but in the end they, like everyone else, prefer a good story to what really happened.   When I was but four years of age, the people I called my parents, the Duke and Duchess Cadwalder, decided to put me in the care of my uncle and aunt, the Lord and Lady Marcan. To be polite, I will say that my so-called parents could not contend with me. It was not that I was an ill-mannered child, for I was always seeking their affections and their approval, but it was as if they could not bare to love me nor to care for me as they did their elder son and daughter. While the Duchess could only look upon me coldly, the Duke could hardly look upon me at all, and then only with such an appearance of profound sadness that it looked as if his heart might break. I do not know what was said, but it was an argument in the night between my them settled my fate, and in the gloaming of the next morning I was whisked away to the Citadel of the Scylding some days away.  I will be as brief as I can be in regards to the Citadel as that there are no doubt a number of tomes written on its purpose and history already, although hopefully I will not be as dry.   The Citadel of the Scylding was originally built as Havenold Castle in the western Wulfingum Mountains to serve as a place of refuge in times of war, as well as a storehouse for arms and a reserve of soldiery. After a time the soldiery became renown for their skills, even surpassing the knightly orders of the kingdom, and soon a military college was formed, the Citadel of the Scylding, and its graduates are given the title Scyld. I would like to note that the only difference between the Scylding and other knightly orders is that while the knights may serve a god or a noble, Scylding serve only the kingdom of Lleogyr and pledge their alliance to no other. For well over five hundred years it has been thus, and even today the Citadel and it’s surrounding town still serve it’s original purpose, and that is where I will finally start my story.  It was early in the winter of my tenth year when the rumors of war had reached the Citadel. For nearly half a century the Merovingas in the north had been trying to invade Lleogyr and its neighbors, led by their dark god, Cwome. They had been bent for conquest, but had been repeatedly fended off, and a wary eye was kept on their borders for their next attempt. It had been quiet for some years, though, as if they had been biding their time, and indeed they had. Heldan, our neighbor to the west, had been overrun and it was only a matter of time before the Merovingas would attempt to make their way east. With the Citadel guarding one of the mountain passes, we had no doubt they would head our way, and neither did King Vortigern. By the end of the winter all the Scyldings had returned to the Citadel from throughout the kingdom, and it was not long before more reinforcements were to come. By the time the first lords had come with their troops, along with the first of the refugees, we had already prepared the city and castle for siege, and kept watch over the wide river valley below.  I will not give a list of all the lords with all their troops to arrive to our defense, that can be found in the history books, but I will make note of one in particular, not because of who he was, but because of who was traveling with him.  As with all the pomp and circumstance that happens with the arrival of nobles in full military regalia, my cousin, Saorla, and I had made it a habit to join the rest of the inhabitants of the Citadel to watch every entry parade that came in. Although colorful, and a rather loud (some lords seemed to have more drummers than soldiers), I have to admit on the whole I was rather disappointed, but only because being raised among the Scyldings, none could best our soldiery, a bias which I still hold to this day.   It was early afternoon when Lord Dunegalan had approached with his troops, and at four years my senior, Saorla had once again dragged me from my perch in the tallest garden tree to go watch their arrival from the gate into the heart of the keep itself. I remember how sullen I was as I watched the soldiers and the knights parade in. The sound of the drums echoing off the walls and towers carved from the mountain itself was nearly making me deaf. My cousin had chided me on looking unladylike, while my best friend, Bran, watched in uncharacteristic silence as the soldiers moved through the gate below us. A wave of my own sadness washed over me, keeping me from arguing with Saorla as I glanced at Bran. War was coming, and his father was one of the Scyldings, and Scyldings never held back from a battle.  “That’s General Hugh ap Dafyth,” Saorla continued in her litany of names of who was who, what their standard was, and why. She may have been schooling to be a healer to follow in the ways of my Aunt Aragwen, but she had an obsessive streak when it came to knowing nobility, and with all the arrivals, it was becoming maddening.  “Yeah, well, who’s that!” I growled, pointing down at the rather small person in new chainmail armor riding next to him.  “Tanwin, don’t be rude. Remember, you’re the niece to Lord Ioanan Marcan, and like me you represent the Citadel to the outside world.”  I would have grumbled something back, churlish as I was at being confined within the walls of the Citadel (everyone may marvel at how massive it is, but to a girl who enjoyed playing on the mountain-side and in the valley, it was terribly small), but my attention was instead held completely by whomever it was riding beside General Dafyth.  At first I wondered if perhaps the fellow was one of the mountain folk that some outsiders call dwarves, but he neither had the broad girth, nor any beard that I could see. He was too small to be the forest folk, the people some call elves, and I was beginning to wonder if he wasn’t something completely else. Here at the Citadel we had more than a few of the mountain folk in residence as teachers, craftsmen, and even a few Scyldings. Forest folk were a bit more rare though, and only a couple I knew lived at the Citadel, purely as teachers, one of whom was my assigned, and beloved guardian.  “Maybe he’s one of those halfling folk that I’ve heard of,” I muttered, watching the horse grow closer, and trying to notice that the person I was staring at was staring back. Even from here I could see his sharp brown eyes. “You know, little people.”  “That’s Carver ap Hugh, you dolt,” Saorla was obviously growing tired of me, as she was want to do being that at her age she had already entered womanhood and I was still a child. “He’s the general’s son, and he’s ten-years-old. Father says he’s going to be admitted into the Scylding academy and start out as a page like all the others.”  I glared down at the boy in armor who by now was glaring back up at me even as he started to ride beneath the main gate. I watched unblinking as the coif of his new armor slid from his head, revealing a mop of wild dark-blonde curls. How I hated him! My husband may laugh to read this, but seeing this boy in new armor riding into the Citadel to be admitted to the academy had struck such a pang of jealousy the likes of which perhaps he never knew. Other boys had indeed come to the Citadel over the years to start out their lives first as pages in their boyhood, then as squires in their teens, seeking to become gifted with the title and rights of a Scyld when they were in their twenties. Young and old, I had known them all, but this one, this one snot-nosed little brat in the shiny new chainmail had gotten my ire up! Never in my life had I seen a page show up in armor, let alone new armor, and bold enough to stare me straight in the eye and not stop staring. Even on the other side of the gate, as I watched him pass into the main courtyard to meet with my Lord-uncle and the Scyldings, he continued to stare back at me over his shoulder.  “You’re just upset about there not being any girls in the academy, Tan,” Bran would later tell me as we dined in the common hall with all the other children that had been brought into the Citadel proper for safety.  “No I’m not,” I lied, acutely aware that thus far there had never been a female Scylding.  “No girl’s been submitted to the academy so far,” he said around a mouthful of bread.  “You mean no girl’s been accepted,” I stabbed at a pea with my knife only to watch the green bead fly into my flagon for my troubles.  “No, I mean that no girl has asked for admission.”  “I can’t imagine why.”  Down at the end of the table one of the kitchen women aided by a couple of pages were tending to the younger of the children. The boy I had seen earlier, Carver, moved past them, only to pause and sweetly ask one of the women for a basket of bread which she happily gave him. No longer in armor, he was now dressed in a finery the likes of which I had only seen in court costume, angelic and perfect in his appearance, the son every parent would have wanted. If he had been closer I would have slapped the smirk from his face when he saw me and ambled back out of the hall with the attitude of the arrogant.   I would have to wait almost two weeks before I could do what I most desired on the field of opportunity, and a true field it was. Outside the Citadel the first skirmishes had begun, but in the heart of the Citadel, in the large castle proper, we children were allowed to play as we liked under the watchful eye of the elder pages, a few squires, and some of the adults who could do nothing else; in the Citadel whole, both city and castle, all served as they could in the times of need, ours was one of only two cities with our own militia as well as army.   Daneball is a favored sport among those of the Citadel, and of Lleogyr as a whole. Played by two teams, the field can be as large as necessary, and the teams as large as desired, with one goal post on either side of the field. Each team has a Quick armed with a padded representation of a dagger, and two Friends who stand a little ways behind the quick armed usually with a padded sword and shield. As for the rest of the team, they can be armed with whatever padded weapon or shield they wish, but until the game begins, they must remain at the goal post they are supposed to be protecting. The goal of the game is of course to get the ball to the opposite end of the field and tag the post to score a point. There are a couple of clinchers to this, though. Only the Quicks can touch or carry the ball, and while the rest of the team is trying to defend them, they are also trying to keep the opposing team from scoring, usually by “killing” the other quick by tagging them with a padded weapon. If both Quicks “die” then the game is at a draw and a new game begins. It’s a bit like a semi-organized field-battle, but with us youngsters it pretty much turns into a controlled moving mob. Just the way I like it!  “Daneball game!” Heldain shouted as he trotted into the garden where most of us were playing, talking, or watching over the little ones. “Who’s up for a daneball game?” he laughed, tossing the ball sky-ward and catching the big thing in one hand. As one of the larger, older pages, he was on the cusp of being chosen as a squire, but for now he was a fun kind of big-brother, and the instigator for most of our exciting group games.  I leapt to my feat, eager for a game, joining the throng that either wanted to watch or join in.  “Why don’t you go play with your dolls, little girl?” Carver said snidely, suddenly stepping into my path.  “Get out of my way!” I snarled, trying to push past.  “Why don’t you make me.”  I gave him a gentle shove to just get him out of my way, only to find him shoving me back a few steps. Angered, I pushed him harder, only to find myself being pushed back hard enough in turn to set me on my rump. I glared up at him.  “What are you going to do, little girl, cry?”  “No,” I said through gritted teeth as I started to get up. “I’m going to hand you your head.”  “Tanwin, he’s just trying to get you angry,” the unshakably calm Bran said at my shoulder. I had known him since I had arrived at the Citadel, and as children of the same age, we had become fast friends and the proverbial bookends. He had never once gotten me into trouble, and never once led me astray.  “Yes, listen to him, listen to your friend. He’s a boy” Carver goaded with another one of his infuriating smirks.  “Tan, you’re my Quick, got it?” Heldain interrupted, taking me by the shoulder and leading me to the field like a guardian brother he tried to be.  I have been reminded on occasion that I am not only rather stubborn, but apparently I have a bit of a temper, and as my husband likes to bring up on occasion when I am worrying over our own children, it was apparently far worse when I was younger.   I will concede here and now that remembering back on this, it is indeed the truth, as a child I had just a little bit of a bad temper, and in that daneball game, Carver got the worst of it. Heldain had chosen me to be the Quick on his team because I was small and fast, as opposed to the skinny runt that a couple of the kitchen-women chided me as being while they handed me sweetrolls aplenty. That day I did not disappoint him, although after a time he as well as the other team captain began to realize something was a bit amiss. It seemed that every time I had gotten my hands on the ball, I kept heading straight for Carver and either barreling over him myself or letting one of my “Friends” do it for me as they fought to keep up. I will admit that no matter where he was standing on the field, I was headed straight for him, deliberately running him over, running him down, or just plain kicking him in the shins to before knocking him over. Daneball is not a game for delicate flowers, and although I can already imagine my dear husband laughing to read this, I indeed had my sights on teaching the snot-nosed boy a lesson. Unfortunately for me, the teaching session didn’t last for long as that the captains decided to put him on my team for the rest of the game, but something rather interesting did happen. Cedric, who was playing one of the “Friends” had gotten wolloped a little too hard and decided to sit out to rest of the game. I don’t know what was in Heldain’s head, but he put Carver in the empty spot, and from then on our side kept winning. Carver had turned into the best “Friend” I had ever had on the field, and a perfect shield-man. By the end of the game I was wondering if I had been wrong about him, and by dinner we were comparing bruises and trading strategies.   Later that night, when all had gone to sleep, and even Bran had gotten tired of my storytelling and was snoring away in the large common room with the rest of the children, I made my way back to my private room in my uncle’s wing of the castle proper.  “Psst!”   At first I wasn’t sure where the sound was coming from.  “Hey, you, little girl,” the brisk whisper made me turn to find Carver standing just outside of the doorway to the common room.  “I’m not a little girl.” The need for sleep had made me surly.  “Well then I guess you need to tell me your name then so I can call you something else.”  “It’s Tanwin Scathach, if you really need to know Carver ap Hugh.”  Even in the half-darkness of the torch-lit halls Carver’s eyes sparkled brightly as he made a sweeping bow. “My lady,” he smiled broadly. “If I may, perhaps I might show you a bit of a trick I have.”  I raised my eyebrow at this.  “Wouldn’t you like a sweet-roll before retiring for the night? The cooks are already preparing them for the morning.”  Sure enough, as I watched from the shadows as he blatantly walked into the kitchen, smiled his most angelic smile at one of the cooks, said something, and was rewarded with two sweet-rolls of which one he presented to me with another bow when he returned to the hall. He had done what few if any of the pages, squires, or scylding had ever done. He had gotten a cook to part with food before the meal was served. I was impressed.  Darkness and sadness descended soon enough even in the haven of the castle proper. The skirmishes had turned into a full-fledged siege, and we knew it was only a matter of time before the Merovingians would get their larger siege engines through the pass. For now they had us sealed within the city walls, and while the fields were still too wet with spring growth to burn, it did not mean that they had no other way of making our lives miserable. Fiery arrows and small catapults were the least of our worries.  One morning as I looked out my window and gathered myself for yet another boring day. I wished for the millionth time my guardian, Peraduer, could be with me, teaching me, playing with me, singing to me in elven to calm my fears, and aiding me in practicing the bow and wooden sword. I so wanted to feel that I was doing something to help my uncle and the people I had grown up knowing and loving as one large family.  I could only shudder as I watched from my high window as more than a hundred Scyldings stood in silent formation on the inner practice fields, fields I had played on only the day before. Fully armored, I saw only the color of gray with the familiar red and cold crest of the Citadel emblazoned on their left shoulder plates. Each face I could see I recognized: Scyld Donigal Hillsfar, Scyld Maelogan Cadwalader, and countless others I had been raised around. There were none there whose names I did not know like my family, only because they had become my family, as had everyone in the castle itself. Page, squire, scyld, forge-master, cook, I knew them all, and at the front of the Scyldings sat my uncle, and beside him my guardian Peraduer of the Green.  At first I thought it some horrible dream, some nightmare come to haunt me as I heard Uncle Ioanan Marcan call the orders. As one the Scyldings put their helms upon their heads, unsheathed their swords, and charged from the field, straight for the castle gates, and the city beyond. Although I could not see them, I could hear the thunder of the hooves, and imagine them riding through the six city gates, charging out of the seventh and onto the field of battle. My world was shattering, being destroyed by an outside force I could do nothing about, and while the people I cared about most were dying, I was being hidden away like the child I was.   Although I do not remember it, I have been told of it. That when Bran and Carver with their uneasy truce came to find me for breakfast, they found instead a couple of the castle guard and my Aunt Aragwen trying desperately to unlock the door as a shrill scream erupted unending from my room.   When the door was finally open it was said that I was found in my bed with my dagger and my bow in my lap, and blood on my hands as I rocked back and forth sobbing and screaming. The window had been broken, and my aunt being the healer she was, recognized easily that I had put my hands through the glass. I had pounded at the thick window so hard that I had broken it with the palms of my hands.  I do remember sitting in the large infirmary of the castle proper eating a bit of bread as I sat on the edge of a cot, wondering why my hands tingled so. I remember saying something about it to my aunt, who was sitting beside me, but I don’t recall her answer. All I know is that was when I heard the shouting in the hall growing closer, and a rushing of heavy footsteps my aunt was off to meet whomever was coming. That was when I saw Scyld Paelan Godswin, Bran’s father, covered in blood and gore with most of his armor gone being carried in on a stretcher, and he was only the first. From there the world became a haze of red confusion as I made room and tried to keep out of the way. Looking back, I know I was in shock as I wandered back and forth in the hall outside of the infirmary door, praying out loud to whatever gods would hear me that all the Scylding would live, that no one would die, and my home as I knew it would be back again, unchanged. Bran stood in pale silence against the wall opposite the infirmary door as Carver tried to quietly comfort us both as best he could. Eventually, he convinced Bran to come with him to at least get something to eat, but I wouldn’t go. This was my family, I thought, and I had to watch over them, praying with all my might to ensure their safety.  It was after they had gone that it happened.  Standing where I was, a frenetic calmness in a sea of controlled chaos, I had heard a scream, a familiar scream, and the sobbing of a breaking heart.Out of the infirmary Bran’s mother, Teagan, was being escorted, clutching what I assumed to be her husband’s sword to her chest. Two of the healers were trying to calm her, but I knew the truth even if they weren’t saying it. Scyld Godswin was going to die, if he wasn’t dead already, and there was nothing Lady Godswin could do about it. The war had shattered her world.  A shout for help and the arrival of more mangled Scylding summoned the healers away. I dared not look at them as they passed, but only watched Lady Godswin for fear that I too would break.  There is a kind of madness that takes some people when a loved-one dies. It is a madness of action, of violence, of revenge, and protection. It is a hate, a fury, a kind of berserker rage, and watching Lady Godswin, I was bearing witness to it. In a moment she was off, striding down the hall with such a mad speed I was racing to keep up. Out onto the castle grounds she went, out through the castle gates, and through each consecutive city gate. We seemed to be ghosts to everyone, as no one stopped the raging lady as she passed, nor the young girl running to keep up. To my horror, they never even looked our way.  The last of the gates, the one that leads down to the river valley, had been left open but securely guarded, allowing for the wounded to be returned from the battle below. Unfortunately, one of the enemy cavalry had slipped past, and rode up towards the Citadel with amazing speed.  All I could do was helplessly run after Lady Godswin, screaming her name as she charged the mounted horseman with sword ready for the killing swing. His was the strike that got in first, though, and as I watched my best friend’s mother, a potter known for her skill and art, drop like a boneless doll with her life struck from her, the rider went past me, leaving me unharmed.   Scyld Donigal Hillsfar made quick work of the man, though, running him through as he charged in unseen from the side. He also made quick work of me, as he grabbed me by the back of my tunic and hoisted me over the cropper of his saddle. I was all I could do not to retch as we went back through the city, although there was little but bread to regurgitate. I had seen war, I had seen death, and I had seen it all touch the people I most cared about.  “Why?” I asked weakly, barely able to breathe let alone speak. “Why Scyld Hillsfar?”   “It’s for your own safety, Tanwin,” he replied brusquely as we reached the castle proper and he pulled me from the saddle as he dismounted and dragged me into the keep itself. “You are a child and you are not supposed to be out on the field of battle let alone close to it.”  “But I can fight,” I protested weakly, looking up at the man I considered second in greatness only to my uncle. “I know how to use a bow. I could shoot from the walls.”  The change of light we entered the keep for a moment created a halo above the cropped blonde hair of the scylding’s head. He frowned hard as he made his way up the stairs, his hard blue eyes flashing in a way I had never seen before. It was not anger. It was something else.  “No, Tanwin,” he answered firmly. “You’re too young.”  “But I’ve learned how to use a bow since I was four. I’m ten seasons old now. I know how to fight. Please, I must go,” I felt my voice growing stronger.  Hillsfar did not reply. He continued to walk, pausing only long enough to pick me up in his arms and carry me bodily towards what I knew to be the children’s common area.  “I can fight,” I insisted, feeling a sudden surge of determination. I had to do something, something to protect my family. “I can use my bow and I can fight.”  “Are you so eager to die, Tanwin Scathach?” Hillsfar growled so vehemently that I actually cringed. “I thought you would have learned by now after your little foray! After what you saw! Lest I remind you Tanwin Scathach, you are a ten-year-old girl, a child, and as such you are to stay as far away from battle as possible. You are to stay with the other children, and in case you do not understand, we are trying to keep you safe!”  I could say nothing as Scyld Hillsfar deposited me at the door of the children’s common room. I stared in at all the little ones playing, oblivious or ignoring the world around them beyond that room. They were innocent, they did not know, they had not seen, they had not grown up within the walls of the Citadel of the Scylding.  “I have to fight,” I announced, turning on my heel to face the behemoth of a man Hillsfar was.   “Don’t!” he pointed a gloved finger sharply at me, pinning me in place. “As niece to Lord Marcan there are certain things expected of you, and one of them is to behave and follow orders. Now be quiet.”  “But I can’t,” I protested as Hillsfar turned to go, just as quickly turning back.  “What has gotten into you, child?” he demanded. “Do you think this siege is some kind of game, your playground to play in?”  “No,” I replied truthfully.  “Then stay here.”  “But I can’t!”  “Tanwin Scathach, I am a scyld, and as a scyld I am expected to be at the city walls right now fighting. Instead of taking on the enemy in combat, I am here arguing with an obstinate child. I expected more of you. Now behave! I will have no more of it!”  “But it’s my fault,” I cried out as Hillsfar turned his back on me to go. “It’s my fault she died! It’s all my fault! If I’d had my bow I could have saved her. I could have saved her!”  Hillsfar looked at me, the brilliance gone from his ice-blue eyes. “Tanwin,” his voice was soft, “you could not have saved Lady Godswin. If you had had your bow, then you would have been a target too. They would have killed you as well. Because you were unarmed, they saw you only as a girl-child, and so they let you live.”  “But I know how to fight,” I could feel the tears slipping down my cheeks. “I have to fight. Everyone with a weapon and training is expected to be at the city wall, expected to fight.”  “Tanwin, you are ten years old, be reasonable!” the growl was starting to return to Hillsfar’s voice. “You’re too young! All the other children of the town have been safely tucked out of harms way in the Citadel, and so you should be too.”  “But it’s my home too!” I nearly shouted. “It’s my duty to protect my home, to protect my people, to serve the kingdom!”  Hillsfar smiled without merriment. “You are not a scyld, you are a child.”  “Then why did you let Lady Godswin fight!” I screamed more to the world at large and to myself than to him. “Why did you let her die! If I had had my bow I could have protected her! But which is worse, not being able to protect those who cannot fight, or letting those who cannot fight into the battle, and getting them killed! She was a potter and an artist, not a warrior!”  Silence.  I could feel my body trembling even as I dared to look at Scyld Hillsfar again. A painful kind of understanding seemed to flick behind his eyes.  “Lady Godswin made her own decision to take up arms, it was regretful,” he said quietly.  “She took up her husband’s sword because he died! She took up Scyld Godswin’s sword because she had her family to protect.”  “She was mad with grief.”  “Was she mad because she went to do what she felt she had to do, that she had to fight to protect her family and her city? Am I mad because I want to do the same? Are you mad because as a chevalier it’s your oath to do exactly what Lady Godswin sought to do, to protect the people around her, especially those she loved?” In silence at the back of my mind I was thanking my tutors for learning how to argue with eloquence even at such a young age. Just because I had not been accepted into the Scylding academy did not mean that I could not learn at least a part of what the pages did.  Hillsfar was quiet.  “I am Duke Cadwalder’s daughter, and Lord Marcan’s neice. I understand there are certain things that are expected of me. One of them is to protect my own people, those of this city, and those that I love and care about. I know how to use a bow. I must fight.”  “What is it that you really want, Tanwin?” asked the scyld wearily.  “I don’t want you to die. I don’t want my uncle to die, nor Peraduer, nor anyone else.” I replied. “I don’t want anyone to die, save for the enemy that would kill us all. I want to be like you. I want to be a Scyld. I want to protect the people who cannot fight, like Lady Godswin.”  Removing his gauntlets and placing his right hand gently atop my head, Hillsfar smiled wanly.  “They say that those with red hair are notorious for their tempers, but I think they’re wrong,” he said as he gently tousled my flat locks. “Perhaps it is not temper, but spirit. Aim that spirit true, Tanwin, and you’ll have all that you need in your life. Aim that spirit true, and I can see you becoming the first woman scyld ever to ride from the Citadel.”  Turning once again to go, Hillsfar paused a moment before adding,  “Until then, Tanwin Scathach, you are no more than a girl-child, and here you will stay until your uncle or your guardian comes for you. Be strong, Tanwin, and pray for all of us.”  In a moment he was gone, leaving me staring after him in silence, feeling unheard but not un-cared for, and resolved to do something.  “Bran’s in the chapel with his father,” Carver said quietly as I found him sitting on the corner of my bed in my room. “He said he wanted to be alone. I don’t know what happened to his mother, they said she just ran off”  I pursed my lips, fighting back the threatening tears as I belted on my dagger, and picked up my bow and quiver of arrows. “Lady Godswin is dead,” I said. “She went to take on the enemy in Scyld Godswin’s place and barely got out of the main city gate.”  Carver was silent, and I didn’t dare to look at him as I adjusted the quiver on my back.  “And what are you doing?” he finally asked after a moment.  “I’m going to do what Lady Godswin couldn’t,” I replied firmly. I would leave no room for argument here.  “And what is that?”  I could feel the fire in my chest, tightness in my jaw, strength in my legs and arms I had never known before. “I’m going to kill those that would kill my family. I am going to kill the Merovingas the best way I know how, with my bow, and from the city walls.”  “Your mad,” his brown eyes were wide.  “No, I’m enraged,” I corrected him. “Now are you going to help me, or do I need to worry about slipping through the city myself. I got through once, now that they’ve seen me and know what’s happened, I don’t think the guards are going to let me through again on my own volition.”  “Just like daneball, huh?”  “Just like daneball,” I nodded.  “Then let’s go!”  I don’t know how he did it, but Carver was true to his word, and as on the daneball field, he had gotten me through the city and to the city walls without incident, and without anyone noticing me. At the steps to the battlements by the main gate, it was another matter though.   “They spotted me,” Carver shoved me up the steps. “I’ll lead them off! Just go! Do it!”  Scrambling up the wooden stares on my hands and feet, I felt my legs and arms go wobbly and my stomach synch up in fear. For a moment I was wondering what in the great heavens had gotten me here, what crazy, childish notion I had as I watched the flurry of activity on the battlement walkway. None had seen me, their attention was out onto the field, and by the sound of it our soldiers were hurrying back in through the city gate even as the Merovingians were reaching the walls. Archers were pulling back on their bowstrings and letting loose as fast as they could while others were preparing the catapults, pots of boiling oil, and other weapons of war.   Feeling the bow in my hand I knew it was time. I was no longer a child. I may not have been a scyld, but like the fellow inhabitants of castle and town, I was not about to let the enemy take what was mine. Still unnoticed by those around me, I found an open space at the battlement and took my place in it, knocking my first arrow and preparing to take aim.   I will be truthful and say that when I first laid eyes on the field I nearly lost both my arrow and my nerve. I thought I had seen blood and death in the infirmary and with the loss of Lady Godswin, but it was nothing compared to the carnage I saw now on the ground below. I could not believe it, all the dead, but who I could not tell. Then I spotted my uncle’s shield laying discarded in the mud and my world changed forever as I let loose my first arrow in combat and watched it lodge into a Merovingian’s throat. Power and the feeling of righteousness surged through my veins as I watched the man clutching helplessly at his throat and then fall over dead. I had taken a life to save my people, and I was determined to save more.  I was no helpless child!  My second arrow penetrated a Merovingian breastplate, my third only struck a soft leg, but someone else finished that one off.   Something flashed in front of me, past me, but I paid it no mind as I knocked my fourth arrow, took aim and let loose into a Merovingian’s arm. I was growing frustrated that my aim had not constantly killed a man with each shot, and I told myself I would make time for more practice later.   It was after I let loose my fifth arrow and was watching the results that I realized that a siege ladder had been hooked into the battlement wall right in front of me. As I knocked my sixth arrow I saw an armored shadow rise above me, and as I looked up to take aim I stared directly into the eyes of my enemy, and my rage knew no bounds. Even as he smiled at me, I wondered if the thought he saw only a child with a toy bow, a little nothing girl pampered and preened in the houses of lords and dukes, a little girl whose only worth in age was for a contract marriage to bind two powerful houses together.  The Merovingian waived his sword in the air playfully, smiling and laughing.  My sixth arrow went into his left eye, and when he slowly toppled over onto the battlement, I had time to not only step out of the way, but pull out my dagger. I ended his pitiful wails by ramming my dagger into his heart and twisting, engorged on the hate and the power that moved me.  “I am no child,” I heard myself shout, and then I felt the hands grabbing at me, pulling my dagger and bow from my hands and lifting me off of my feet.  Terror and rage had me shrieking at the top of my lungs for help as I found myself being carried from the battlements. The enemy had taken me, alive, thought me a child, and now this.  “Tanwin,” I heard a familiar voice cry out and I craned my head to see my guardian, Peraduer, upon a horse, arms open and receiving and they received me pulling me up to sit in the saddle before him.  As we rode off back towards the castle, I saw the faces of people I knew looking worried, looking proud, looking haggard, but all looking hopeful. These were the people who had carried me from the battlement away from harm into the arms of someone I considered my second father.  “Scyld Scathach!” I heard someone shout, but Peraduer said nothing as we rode on into the heart of the city and then into the heart of the Citadel itself.  “Down,” he said gently, offering me a hand after dismounting first. I gratefully took, sliding from the saddle only to find my legs hardly under me.  “My uncle,” I gasped, fearful, terrified to the core.  Green eyes smiled gently, knowingly under dark brows. “You saw his shield,” he nodded. “Have no fear, he only dropped it when he was forced to wield a second sword. He is safe. You would have heard him calling orders to the archers to pull back from your position had you been listening.”  I could feel the heat of a blush coming on, the bane of fair skin.  “Did he see?” I asked hoarsely, my eyes cast to the ground.  “Yes, he did,” I heard my uncle reply. Apparently he had ridden ahead of us and was waiting, though I could not bare to look up at him. Though a wonderful and warm man, he was a terror to me in his anger, not for fear of violence, but for fear that I had failed him.   “I see you did not change your mind, Tanwin,” I heard Hillsfar add. “I am disappointed in you.”  “Well,” my uncle said tersely, “what do you have to say for yourself, young lady?”  My head snapped up and all the tears that I had held back for so long turned traitor on me and burst forth. “I am no little girl,” I said so firmly I thought that even the gods believed it. “I may not be a Scyld, I may not be a woman yet, but I sure as the heavens will protect my family and the people of this city. Lady Godswin may not have known how to fight, but I do, and I will!”  “Indeed?” was all my uncle said, looking at me with that calm gaze that told me he was thinking, calculating, assessing, and planning what he was going to do with me next. “And so you have chosen to put yourself and others at risk by placing yourself with your bow on the battlements and taking potshots at the enemy?”  “I was aiming, sir,” I replied, unwilling to yield my ground. What I had done was right, and I knew it to the marrow of my bones.  “So you were,” he nodded. “So you were, but were you thinking of those around you? Were you thinking of yourself, or were you just thinking of revenge for the Godswin’s deaths?”  “I was thinking of killing the enemy, sir,” I said in quiet truthfulness as I came to realize what I had done.  “I was thinking of revenge.”  “Well, Page Scathach, until such time as you learn the ways of organized combat, I would advise you to remain here at the castle and to move your things into the dorms. Leftenant Elsdon of Gosfrey will come to collect you at your room, but I will add that you are on probation.” My uncle held up a warning finger. “Every six months I will be receiving evaluations from your teachers and trainers, and I expect them to be exemplary. If they are not up to standards, then I shall pull you from the academy without so much as a second thought. Am I understood.”  “Yes, sir,” I nodded, completely caught off guard by what my uncle was implying, as well as his calm demeanor. Frankly, at that moment I was confused, and apparently he saw it.  “Tanwin,” he placed his large hands on my shoulders, “I know you are young, and you are strong, and you are very capable, as well as rather brash. But your heart and your ideas are in the right place. I know why you did what you did, and it was far more than revenge. No, your are not a little girl, you are a girl with the heart of a scyld and with your drive I have no doubt you will attain that title, but for now we must teach you how to aim your energies, teach you how a real battle is fought. Daneball may be a fun game, but it is lousy for the strategies of large groups in combat.”  The siege at the Citadel was a brief one as I later learned, lasting only a couple of weeks as compared to the months and even years other fortified cities had faced. Attrition had caused the enemy to finally flee as death came to them in a three-fold fashion. It was not just those of the Citadel that culled their hideous ranks. Winter winds had come late that year, bringing a killing cold in the night to those caught unprepared. I believe in the end, though, it was the wolves that convinced the remains of the army to leave. Although none in the Citadel had seen anything more than a rare large shadow the size of a horse in the gloaming before sunset or sunrise, we had all heard their howls to the hunt followed by the screams of the confused and dying. In the morning we could see their handiwork and carnage though, and the huge paw prints they left behind.   It was not long thereafter that a herald came from the king announcing the end of the war. He declared no victory, as I remember, only a cessation to the war. The Merovingian armies had left the lands, leaving the kingdom completely, not caring of the dead they left behind. We had survived, those who had lived counted their blessings as they gathered together once again, but we mourned those that we lost.  As for Carver ap Hugh, Bran Godswin, and myself, well, those are other tales for other times when Lord Belheris grants me blessings again. For now, I can only thank Him, and the other Gods who have looked upon me with favor, and finally finish this tale of mine.

"       What is Kabbalah? Kabbalah is a Hebrew word literally meaning “tradition”.  Sometimes Kabbalah is defined as “Jewish mysticism”.  That’s not a false definition, but it’s limiting.  In fact, while the body of teachings known as “Kabbalah” lies at the heart of Jewish tradition, it also ties together astrology, the Tarot, the European runes, and the Western esoteric tradition. There’s a wonderful tension in the Jewish tradition between the consciousness that “the Torah is a holy, pure, and absolutely unique teaching,” and the consciousness that “the Torah is an expression of universal truths, which we share with all cultures.”  There’s room in the tradition for both frames of mind, but clearly for our discussion the second will be more useful.     THE THIRTY-TWO PATHS OF WISDOM Less well known than the Sefer Yetzirah proper, the Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom is presented as an appendix in editions of the Sefer Yetzirah.  Rabbinical commentaries on the Thirty-Two Paths are scarce, sparse, and contradictory. This is too bad, because the Thirty-Two Paths appears to offer a point-by-point explanation of the meaning of the Tree of Life diagram.  The text itself, though, is problematic, because it does not spell out which sefiroth, letters, or paths correspond with each of its items.  There are multiple opinions among the Rabbis as to which letter goes with which path, and then again as to how the paths should matched with the paragraphs of the Thirty-Two Paths text.  There is a commentary on the Paths  by someone calling himself Raavad, but he is probably not the Rabbi Abraham ben David (“Raavad” for short) of the Talmud, according to both historians and kabbalists (see Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah, appendix IV), and his commentary is of only limited help. Fortunately, the Western occultists have preserved an interpretation that incorporates the Thirty-Two Paths in a meaningful system, together with the Major Arcana of the Tarot.  This system explains each path in a clear manner that is consistent with the generally accepted meanings of the adjacent Sefiroth.  Because I find it the most convincing overall, I have adopted it here.  Jewish purists may object that this system does not wholly correspond with any of the Rabbinic versions; however, as I have said, the Rabbinic interpretations are for the most part mutually exclusive and were very likely intended to confuse. In this version, the Paths begin with the Sefiroth themselves in their customary descending order.  The Hebrew letters are then assigned to the connecting lines of the Tree of Life, moving (for the most part) right to left and top to bottom.  The version of the Tree of Life used here is the older version cited by Moses Cordovero, and not the later Lurianic version where the lower channels from Netzach and Hod to Malkhuth were moved to different positions.  (For a full discussion of the two versions, see Leonora Leet, The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah.)  It would be tempting to identify the three “mother letters” of the Sefer Yetzirah with the three horizontal lines and the seven “doubles” with the vertical lines, but this system does not follow that attribution.  Rather, it takes the Hebrew alphabet in its traditional order as an integral progression. The following commentary, then, draws on both Jewish and Western sources.  I have also included an original commentary on the Prayer of Hannah (in I Samuel 2:1-10), which is included in some Jewish prayerbooks; it appears to follow the structure of the Sefiroth and may shed some light on their meaning. Finally, you do not have to know Hebrew to use this commentary.  Because this commentary is quite detailed, I have included some Hebrew terminology when necessary, but my goal has been to make the ideas accessible and useful to those who read English.  The footnotes at the end are aimed mostly at readers who do know Hebrew and may wish to compare my translations with the original sources.   1.  KETER  -- sekhel mufla ·Keter (crown).  Wondrous mind:  the light originally conceived, the First Glory.  No created thing can reach it.   ·My heart exults in the Eternal; my power is exalted in the Eternal; I have triumphed over my adversaries, for I rejoice in Your salvation. The only thing that can be known about this level is that it is unknowable.   In Hannah’s prayer, the channel of Keter is opened through pure joy in existence.  The Hebrew idiom for “my power is exalted” literally means “my horn is raised up”, and the word for horn, keren, can also mean radiance.  So the image here suggests raising one’s head in joy and receiving the blessing of Heaven. This is the experience of the pure joy and wonder of being alive.  It is the consciousness that life is a free gift that we have done nothing to earn.  In our daily lives, it is what keeps us going.   It is also the source of our will.  More specifically, Keter represents the unity of attention with intention, as suggested by the Hebrew word kavanah, which has both meanings.  This is our power to act consciously:  to do each and every act as if we really mean it.  The psychologist Viktor Frankl (who survived the Holocaust) and Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (who did not) taught that a sense of meaning is the single most important factor for a person’s well-being.     2.  CHOKHMAH -- sekhel maz’hir ·Chokhmah (wisdom).  Radiant mind:  the radiance of the homogeneous unity, exalted over every head, called by kabbalists the Second Glory.   ·There is nothing as holy as the Eternal, for nothing else exists, and there is no strength like our Creator. Chokhmah means wisdom, but in Kabbalah the word means something more:  it is pure consciousness, and in fact it is also the primal matter of which the universe (space, time, matter, and energy) is ultimately composed.  This is the principle of force, and it is the first point on the right side of the chart—the side of expansion and light.  Its shell, or adverse aspect, is dogmatism. Chokhmah is the first stage of finite existence.  Therefore the next line of Hannah’s prayer calls on the awareness that all things are unified in the Creator. Traditionally, Chokhmah is drawn on the right side of the Tree diagram and is associated with the head; and here (as elsewhere) the Kabbalah anticipates modern science by identifying the intuitive thought of Chokhmah with the “right brain” and the analytical Binah with the “left brain”. Alternatively, Chokhmah may be associated with the “third eye” in yoga, the browpoint, which is also where the head tefillin (phylactery) is worn by observant Jews.  This is the center of insight and intuition.  In any case, the important thing is not to take the physical symbolism too literally. The important thing about the “body”metaphor is to understand that all the parts must function together.  Just as a healthy body requires a free flow of blood through the blood vessels, so does a healthy life require a sound connection between its various aspects -- here described by the Sefiroth and their interconnecting Paths.     3.  BINAH -- sekhel mekudash ·Binah (understanding).  Sanctified mind:  the foundation of Original Wisdom, called Artisan Faith ; cognate to uman (artisan) and emunah (faith ); it is the source of faith, from whose power faith emanates. ·Do not speak much in pride, nor let pride cross your lips, for the Eternal is the source of knowledge, and by the Eternal  are actions measured.   This is the principle of form.  Binah is the vessel; in the intellect, it represents the beginning of rational thought.  This is the first point on the left side of the chart, an area which will be characterized by the symbolism of darkness, receptiveness, multiplicity, mystery, sustainability, and the feminine principle.  Binah represents the process of accepting and weighing the truth, nurturing it in the mind, and giving form to it.  Binah is sometimes called the mother principle.  Its shell is intellectualism. This is the foundation (yesod in Hebrew, here used in its broad sense), or organizing principle, of Original Wisdom. “Original Wisdom” refers to the ten sefiroth together, also collectively called Arikh Anpin.  This sefirah in particular gives shape and structure to the overall arrangement. Binah is the awakening of rational, verbal thought; as we have seen, its gate is the meditation of silence.  Therefore, Hannah’s prayer cautions against reckless speech, and reminds us that the judgment of the Creator is the ultimate truth.  This line also hints at the quasi-sephirah of da’at, knowledge, which is the re-synthesis of Chokhmah and Binah. As we have seen, Binah can be represented by the “left brain” in the body; in yoga, on the other hand, it would correspond to the Throat Chakra, which is associated with communication and creativity.       4.  CHESED -- sekhel kavua ·Chesed (kindness or mercy).  Fixed mind:  from it grow all the spiritual powers in the finest emanations, emanating from one another by the power of Keter. ·The bow of the mighty is crushed, and the fallen are girded with strength.   This is the principle of giving; think of the branches of a tree.  Chesed wants to give freely of all that is pure; it is selfless.    The shell of Chesed is moral weakness or blind obedience.  Chesed is to be given with clarity and intention; not, as the Judaic scholar Julius Lester once put it, “splashed about like cheap paint”. Chesed is the sephirah of mercy and forgiveness; the daily prayers for forgiveness of sins are associated with Chesed.  This is the power to overcome the weapons of “the mighty” -- giborim in Hebrew, which suggests the next sephirah, Gevurah.     5.  GEVURAH -- sekhel nishrash ·Gevurah (strength).  Rooted mind:  The essence of the homogeneous unity, unified in the essence of Binah, which emanates from the [left] side of Arikh Anpin .  ·The well-fed hire out for bread, and the hungry are filled, until the barren woman has borne seven, and the mother of many bears no more.  If Chesed is the branches of the tree, Gevurah is the root.  This is the beginning of self-definition and boundary-setting.  It is the power of silence and the strength of accepting the universe.  Cruelty is the shell of Gevurah. Gevurah is also the strength of endurance and of self-sacrifice.  Hannah invokes the image of “the well-fed hiring themselves out for bread”.  I think this is not simply another “reversal of fortune” (of the kind found so often in Biblical language) but a positive example:  “The well-fed are hiring themselves out,” even though they have enough to eat, to earn charity to give to the poor, so that “the hungry are filled.” The last phrase is sometimes translated “... the mother of many is desolate.”  But again, I do not think we are reading a “reversal of fortune” here:  why would Hannah, herself childless, wish harm to befall the “mother of many”?   Actually, the last word (umlalah) means something finished or ended.  In this interpretation, the “mother of many” has simply come to the end of her childbearing years:  the cycle is completed.  And this is the gate of Gevurah:  the strength to stand firm and let things happen in their course and time.     6.  TIFERETH -- sekhel shefa nivdal ·Tifereth (harmony).  Mind of the contained energy:  within it grows the ray of Keter, and it radiates that energy upon all the blessings unified in its essence. ·The Eternal gives life and death, sends to the underworld and raises again.   In the body, Tifereth symbolically corresponds to the womb; it is where all the emanations of the upper sefiroth combine and take shape, and then emanate into the lower sefiroth.  This is also the process of self-knowledge, through which a person comes to know herself as an individual.  Its shell is narcissism. Tifereth represents the transformation of potentiality into actuality.  Because its essence is rebirth and re-creation, Hannah sees in it the cycle of death and life.  The gate of Tifereth is the understanding of continuous renewal.     7.  NETZACH -- sekhel nistar ·Netzach (eternity or victory).  Hidden mind:  the radiance that shines on all the mental powers which are beheld by the mind and by faith. ·The Eternal impoverishes and enriches, humbles and also raises up.    In ordinary Hebrew, the word netzach can have several meanings:  “victory”, “eternity”, or “leading”.  The root meaning seems to be importance or eminence.  In Kabbalah, Netzach is the final thrust of outward growth.  This is the process of giving of oneself; sharing our unique creative contributions with the world.  It is also the world of the senses, and of vision:  seeing the world around us, and seeing how we would like it to be.  Exploitation and selfishness are the shell of Netzach. It is important to mention here that openness to sensation and inner feeling is not a weakness -- it is a strength. Some people believe that spirituality means shutting off your senses and your awareness of the world.  This is an error.  In fact, even the most disciplined spiritual traditions teach that we must be aware and open to the riches of the world around us -- both in Nature and in our fellow human beings.  This is the richness of which Hannah speaks; but it fades into poverty for those who isolate themselves from the realm of the larger world.  For this reason, too, she connects Netzach with humility:  for the truly humble person is the one who knows how much she has to learn.     8.  HOD -- sekhel shalem ·Hod (splendor).  Integral mind:  the original structure, which sits rooted only in the chambers of greatness that emanate from the essence of its endurance (kiyumo).   ·Raising the poor from the dust, the humble from the dirt-heap, to seat them with nobles, and bequeath to them the seat of honor, for the columns of the earth are the Eternal’s, and the Eternal has set the land on them. Hod means majesty or glory, and the sephirah of Hod is the power of quiet control.  The left side of the chart represents growth, but not the rapid outward growth typified by Chesed and Netzach.  Here we see a sustained growth, described as “endurance” (kiyum) -- a word we shall see again in #23.  Again there is the symbolism of “chambers” here.  Hod is the process of structuring; it’s the practical application of the discipline of Binah and Gevurah.  Hod is associated with hearing, particularly in the context of rational, verbal thought.  Detachment and false “objectivity” are part of the shell of Hod. Hannah’s prayer also echoes the concepts of structure, and of being “seated” or established.  Notice that she uses images of uncleanness to describe the world of chaos, and by contrast shows the pure, “civilized” realm available to those who follow the wisdom of the Eternal.  “Columns” is a reference to Netzach and Hod together, and in fact the kabbalists frequently stress that the exuberance of Netzach and the discipline of Hod are to be seen as complementary. Together, Netzach and Hod correspond to the navel in the body (and to the Navel Chakra in yoga).  The navel is our first and most tangible channel for the inward and outward flow that connects us with the outside world.     9.  YESOD -- sekhel tahor ·Yesod (foundation).  Pure mind:  it purifies the sefiroth, probing and illuminating the outline of their structure so that they are unified with no interruption or separation. ·[The Eternal] will guard the steps of the pious, and the wicked will perish in darkness, for man does not win by force.  The word Yesod means foundation.  Yesod is the sefirah where we discover the universe as it lives inside of us.  It is the individual’s connection with the harmonies of the outside world.  Here she discovers the influences of the moon, the sun, and the natural world in her own body and soul.  This is also the sefirah of expanded consciousness, the trance state where the body is no longer a confinement but a channel.  Because of its power and mystery, the moon is a traditional symbol of Yesod. Hannah speaks of being open to the natural rhythms of the Universe in this line.  The “steps of the pious” are the journey on the Way, the elusive path of least resistance through our dynamic Universe.  In Gevurah we learned to accept the cycles of nature; here we are actively working with them.  It is by acting in harmony with Creation that we achieve success.  In the human realm, Yesod is our capacity to experience another person intimately, through the rhythms of our physical bodies.     10.  MALKHUTH -- sekhel mitnotzetz ·Malkhuth (nobility).  Glistening mind:  it rises and sits on the throne of Binah, and shines with the radiance of all the lights, and radiates the energy of growth upon the ministering angel. ·Those who oppose the Eternal will be shattered; the Eternal will thunder from the heavens, and will judge the ends of the earth, and will give strength to the ruler and will exalt the power of the redeemer . Malkhuth is identified with the divine immanence, the presence of the Spirit in the world.  Traditionally it is considered a feminine sefirah. The sephirah of Malkhuth is also identified with the messianic future, as is made clear in the tenth and final verse of Hannah’s prayer.  Here “ruler” and “redeemer” may also be interpreted as referring to the potential in every person.  Note that the word for “ruler” (melekh) indicates the sephirah of Malkhuth; also, the phrase “exalt the power” (yarem keren) is identical to the expression used in the first verse, intimating the cyclical connection between Malkhuth and Keter. Malkhuth is the realm of manifestation.  It is connected to the physical world.  In our daily lives, it represents our possessions, our homes, and the things we produce.  It is the fulfillment of potential, the validation of the will of Keter.  For example, if you are writing a book on a computer, you can have a hundred pages of text stored in the computer’s memory but you probably will not feel a sense of achievement until you actually see the pages printed on paper. Malkhuth is also the arena of “real life” where we interact with other people in the social sphere.  And it is ultimately here that we must draw the strength to reconnect with Keter.     11. ALEPH -- sekhel metzuchtzach Keter-Chokhmah ·Glaring mind:  the essence of the Veil of the Sanctuary, recounted in the description of the priestly sacrifices, which separates the place of the food-offerings from the chamber of the Spirit; it connects the Paths, that they may stand before the Most Hidden .   ·vertical axis ·air The diaphragm of the body is analogous to the Veil of the Sanctuary, as it separates the organs of digestion from those of respiration (in fact, ruach in Hebrew means both “breath” and “spirit”).  By extension, this represents the separation between heaven (the abode of the spirit) and earth (the world of the body).  You can see this in the shape of the Aleph, where the diagonal crossbar establishes the boundary between the upper and lower parts.  The path denoted by Aleph is the first emanation from Keter, joining it to Chokhmah.  Thus the letter symbolizes the paradox of Spirit and human.  In the Tarot, this is the Innocent (or Fool) who, like the silent Aleph, is yet unformed. The Aleph suggests the paradoxical nature of the Creator.  As humans, we are limited and finite.  We have certain desires, and limited means to achieve them; therefore, we see the world as a place full of obstacles to be overcome.  Not so the Creator.  All things and their opposites spring from a common Source. Aleph is the first of the “mother letters” and corresponds with the vertical axis on the Cube .     12. BETH -- sekhel bahir Keter-Binah ·Glowing mind:  the essence of the wheel Chesed, called the visualizer, the place where seers (prophets, and mystics who enter the merkava ) find their visions.   ·above ·Mercury ·life/death For more on the merkava (chariot), see #18 (Cheth), which connects with Beth at Binah.  Beth signifies the idea of instrumentality:  it is the letter that introduces the process of creation in the book of Genesis.  In the Tarot, this is the Mage (or Magician), who represents psychic power and the ability to channel energy. According to Eakins, the Mage is “the motivating energy at the center of the turning of the spring ... standing at the center of the Wheel of Fortune, which is the circle of life”.     13.  GIMEL -- sekhel manhig ha’achduth Keter-Tifereth ·Mind directing unity:  the essence of the Glory (Keter; see #1), the fulfillment of the truth of individual spirits which are unified above. ·below ·Moon ·peace/war The Tarot card for Gimel is the Priestess, representing inspiration.  The figure on the card holds a scroll, which is usually depicted rolled up.  This represents the secrets of cosmic law.  This is the hidden path of consciousness that travels directly from the transcendent realms of Keter into the individual’s creative capacity in Tifereth. The letter name “gimel” is connected with the word for “camel”, the idea being that it is something that conveys life.  More broadly, it comes from the word gamal, which is often translated “bestow” or “recompense”.  This is giving, but not in the ordinary sense of giving (that’s nathan in Hebrew); rather, it’s a kind of putting energy into the system.  So, for example, the act of doing deeds of kindness is called gomel chesed, because it’s a gift that continues to give.  And it is this kind of fertile energy represented by this path.     14.  DALETH -- sekhel me’ir Chokhmah-Binah ·Illuminating mind.  This is the essence of the speaking silence  and it points toward the secrets of the foundations of holiness and their structure. ·east ·Venus ·wisdom/folly As Rabbi Kaplan explains, the “speaking silence” (chashmal) is the interface between Chokhmah and Binah consciousness.  In the Tarot, Daleth is represented by the Empress, who symbolizes the manifestation of the potential intimated in Gimel.  As such, the Empress is often shown as pregnant, and may be adorned with pomegranates or other emblems of fertility. The letter name daleth means a door, and so this path represents a door opened.  (Symbolically, it could be the door of the womb.)  But the word also has connotations of selflessness , and -- as in the birth process -- it tells us that creativity also means letting go.     15.  HEH -- sekhel ma’amid Chokhmah-Tifereth ·Stabilizing mind.  Stabilizes the essence of creation in the “clouds of purity”, as it says in Job 35:9.  The kabbalists say this was the shadow that descended at Mount Sinai. ·south ·Aries ·sight Here the pure energy of Chokhmah is channeled into Tifereth.  It’s all about structure and clarification:  the commentary explains that this is where nebulous or “cloudy” ideas become solidified so that they can take form.  Hence, the image of heh is the window:  an opening in a structure which gives shape and definition to the image seen. In the Tarot, the Emperor symbolizes this process, and the card is interpreted as referring to any system of laws or constraints.  Broadly, it symbolizes authority.     16.  VAV -- sekhel nitz’chi Chokhmah-Chesed ·Eminent mind.  The abode (edun) of glory, of which no lower glory is the equal.  It is called the “Garden of Eden” prepared for the pious. ·south-east ·Taurus ·hearing The commentary suggests that this path is connected to “control” (another meaning of netzach) of one’s nature.  But perhaps more telling is the corresponding Tarot card, the Priest (or Hierophant).  This figure is generally depicted raising his hands in benediction and wearing a three-tiered crown.  The crown is shown with three, five, and seven ornaments on these three tiers.  These correspond to the three, five, and seven Hebrew words of the three verses of the Priestly Blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), offered by the descendents of Aaron to their Israelite brethren.  The Priest’s hands, too, are raised in the traditional gesture of the Priestly Blessing. The meaning ascribed to the Priest card is revelation or prophetic insight.  This association of prophecy with the Biblical priesthood is important because, as Dr. Leet persuasively argues, the ancient priesthood may have been the source of the mystical rites that facilitated prophecy.  So a better name for this card might be “the Prophet”. This path represents the free flow of pure wisdom (Chokhmah) into self-expression (Chesed).  No wonder its emblem is the a figurehead of revealed religion.  This card has proved particularly troubling to feminist commentators; perhaps this is because, all too often, the authentic inner voice of women’s spirit has been stifled by the “false prophet” of fundamentalist, patriarchal religion.     17.  ZAYIN -- sekhel ha-hergesh Binah-Tifereth ·Sensory mind.  Prepared for the pious ones of faith, to garb themselves in the spirit of holiness; it is called Foundation of Beauty [yesod ha-tifereth] in the upper arrangement. ·east-above ·Gemini ·smell Zayin is the channeling, organizing principle that connects Tifereth to the “upper mother”, Binah.  This is where pure thought or intellect descends into individual consciousness, which has the capacity to experience the senses.  (The senses themselves will be channeled through the lower sefiroth of Netzach and Hod.)  Tifereth is where things first begin to take on their worldly form. Like Binah itself, this path is described as a “foundation” or organizing principle.     18.  CHETH -- sekhel beth ha-shefa Binah-Gevurah ·Mind of the Chamber of the Influx .  In contemplating it, they acquire a secret and a clue, who “dwell in the shadow [of the Most High] ” and adhere to meditation on the essence of the Most Recondite. ·east-below ·Cancer ·speech This is one of the most introspective of the paths.   The Tarot card corresponding to it is the Chariot (merkava in Hebrew) and its astrological sign is Cancer.  I think the “chariot” refers not literally to a wheeled vehicle, but to the act of mystical meditation, which is also known in Hebrew as “merkava”.  In fact, the earliest Rabbinic references to mysticism speak of a meditation called the “act of the merkava”.  While all of the cards imply some kind of inner growth or transformation, this one in particular refers to letting oneself become a “vehicle” for the Spirit.  This indicates a withdrawal from the outside world, which is appropriate and necessary at times in our lives, in order to enable the rebirthing process of Mem (directly below Cheth on the Tree diagram).     19.  TETH -- sekhel sod ha-pa’uloth ha-ruchanioth Chesed-Gevurah ·Mind of the Secret of All Spiritual Activities.  The influx spreads through it from the highest blessing and the supernal glory. ·north-above ·Leo ·taste If the Thirty-two Paths calls this the “Secret of All Spiritual Activities”, then it must be pretty important. And indeed it is:  this is the path between Chesed, kindness, and Gevurah, severity.  The letter Teth is called by Ginsburgh “the hidden good”; its name means “snake”, and suggests the ambiguous guises through which blessing often comes into our lives.  In fact, the Hebrew word for “snake” (teth is Aramaic) is nachash, which has the same gematria (numerology) as “messiah”.  The Tarot card corresponding to Teth is called “Strength” and shows a woman holding a lion’s open jaws.  This is a marvelous visual metaphor for the interrelationship of Chesed and Gevurah, and the card’s title underscores the fact that true strength does not consist of brute force alone.  This path symbolizes the delicate balance between two opposing forces.     20.  YOD -- sekhel ha-ratzon Chesed-Tifereth ·Mind of the Will.  The structure of all created things, and through it the mind knows all the essence of Original Wisdom. ·north-below ·Virgo ·touch This is where kindness turns inward.  The expansiveness of Chesed connects with the womblike creative potential of Tifereth.  The “structure of all created things” is in the realm of Tifereth; reaching upwards into Chesed, the mind grasps the “essence” (though not the “structure”) of the ten sefiroth. Yod means hand and has the numerical value of ten.  Most significantly, it is the first letter of the sacred name of the Divinity (translated in some English bibles as “Jehovah”).  The Tarot card corresponding to Yod is “the Hermit”, which Eakins and others believe should really be called “the Crone”.  It is a card of contemplation, but it is more proactive than the Chariot.  The Crone figure is a “solitary”:  she lives alone, but she is involved.  She is doing things.  She may appear as the lonely figure in the woods, who directs a young wanderer to the correct destination (as in The Twelve Wild Swans).  Or as a solitary practitioner, she may be influencing the course of outside events in other ways.  But she is expressing an inner-focused will that leads outward -- hence the name of the path.    21.  KAPH -- sekhel ha-chefetz ha-mevukash Chesed-Netzach ·Mind of the Object of Desire .  It receives the influx of divinity in order to distribute its blessing to all things. ·west ·Jupiter ·wealth Lying diagonally across from Cheth, this is one of the most outward-going paths.  This is the process of blessings becoming manifest; but it is also the cyclical process of life.  Therefore its Tarot card, “The Wheel of Fortune”, carries symbols representing the growth and dissolution principles.     22.  LAMED -- sekhel ne’eman Gevurah-Tifereth ·Faithful mind.  The powers of the spiritual are increased by it, in order for them to be close to all who dwell in their shadow [or:  in the image ]. ·north-west ·Libra ·action Lamed means goad or teaching, and this path may be regarded as the aspect of life that prods us to learn from experience.  If Kaph is the carrot, Lamed is the stick.  This is the path from the severity of Gevurah to the balance of Tifereth.  Its Tarot card is “Justice”.     23.  MEM -- sekhel kayam Gevurah-Hod ·Established mind.  The power of enduring for all of the sefiroth. ·east-west axis ·water Mem refers to the element of water. The Tarot card for Mem is “the Hanged Man” and the figure is drawn in a curious position:  he is hanging upside down, tied by one ankle to a tree.  What are we to make of this? In fact, the Hanged Man is a sign of rebirth.  Look closely:  his head is down; he is tied by a cord to the tree of life.  He is the fetus in the womb. This explains why the card is associated with the waters of birth.  It is the goal of endurance (recall from # 8 that kayam, like kiyum, means “standing fast”) and the outcome of authentic meditation.  It is what happens when seclusion leads to self-discovery.  It is the reason for having the strength to “hang in there”.    24.  NUN -- sekhel dimyoni Tifereth-Netzach ·Imaginative  mind.  Gives a to all images a likeness appropriate to their stature.  ·south-west ·Scorpio ·motion The wording of this Path also suggests ending or silence (see endnote).  In this light, it is not at all surprising that the Tarot card corresponding to Nun is “Death”.  Nor is it surprising that it follows “The Hanged Man”, which represents birth. This is the journey from Tifereth to Netzach (in one of its aspects, the Sefirah of vision).  This is the process where the object or idea formed in Tifereth begins to assume its final shape.   What is interesting about this Path is the connection with “Death”.  On a certain level, I think Death represents all kinds of “corpselike” activities, when we are going through the motions of life but we’re not really there spiritually.  This is one of the dangers of the descent from the formative world of Tifereth into the final actualization of Yesod and Malkhuth.  (See #25, next.) The positive potential is symbolized on the Tarot card by the white rose (on the flag carried by Death), which harks back to the rose held by the Innocent on #1 above.    25.  SAMEKH -- sekhel nisyoni Tifereth-Yesod ·Testing mind.  The first test by which the Creator tests the pious. ·west-above ·Sagittarius ·vibration The name of the letter Samekh means a support or prop.  A support may be strong or weak, and much depends on its integrity. The path from Tifereth to Yesod is a critical one.  This is where our personality takes form and finds expression.  Not surprisingly, the two paths flanking it on the Tree of Life have rather scary-looking Tarot cards:  “Death” and “The Devil”.  But the card for Samekh is called “Temperance” -- that being an old word meaning either moderation or modification. The symbolism of the card features an angelic figure pouring water from one vessel to another.  This is the flow of thought from the subconscious to the conscious mind and back.  The delicacy of this operation -- which the angel executes without spilling a drop -- represents the urgency of right mind and right action at all times.  In the words Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, “The whole world is a narrow bridge; the main thing is not to fear.”     26.  ‘AYIN -- sekhel mechudash Tifereth-Hod ·Renewed  mind.  Through it the Creator renews all the months  which are renewed through perpetual creation . ·west-below ·Capricorn ·mirth Hod is the lower reflection of Binah; the path from Tifereth to Hod is the connection between the self and the rational, analytical mind.  Its chief danger is materialism.  The Hebrew letter ‘Ayin means “eye” and this is the path where we attempt to organize our experience -- the things we’ve seen.   Hod is also connected with natural law, the “rational” or mechanical side of nature exemplified by the lunar cycle.  It has been suggested that humankind’s earliest use of numbers arose from observing the cycle of the moon.  Because we are now entering the lower and more physical aspects of reality, most of the Paths in this last section will make reference to natural phenomena. The Tarot card corresponding to ‘Ayin is called “The Devil”.  The female and male figures mirror the figures of Eve and Adam in “The Lovers”.  The horned figure seated behind them is holding a torch and is sitting on a half-cube, symbolizing incomplete knowledge. The Devil represents the force of complexity in the universe; its adverse aspect, chaos, appears when that force is denied.  This is not so much the scheming, tragic hero of Milton’s Paradise Lost; I think he is more like Melkor in Tolkien’s Silmarillion, who tirelessly threw into confusion the tidy plans of the four elements. Order without complexity leads to chaos; order without freedom leads to evil.    27.  PEH -- sekhel murgash Netzach-Hod ·Sensory mind.  From it was created the mind of every creature under the upper sphere, and all their sensations. ·north ·Mars ·grace/sin Among their other attributions, Netzach and Hod are said to represent sight and sound respectively.  As the name and description of this Path suggest, this is the connection between the two. The name of the letter Peh means “mouth”.  The mouth is the organ of speech, and of one of the most intimate forms of communication -- the kiss. Ginsburgh explains that “Providence is the power of da’at as revealed by the eyes.  The power of da’at as revealed by the mouth -- speech -- is the more explicit form of contact and communication between two individuals.” The attribute of Peh is Grace, which means elevating something beyond its rigid form and structure. The Tarot card for Peh is especially disturbing for us today.  According to Eakins, the image represents “the Lightning Flash, also called the Descent of Power, through the Tree of Life”.  It is the transformation of matter into energy.  On a more mundane level, the card is interpreted as the elimination of old structures, the loss of a false sense of security, and bankruptcy. The Sefiroth of Netzach and Hod together are said to be connected to the faculty of prophecy. Biblically speaking, a negative example of the Tower archetype would be the Tower of Babel.  Here the imbalanced energy of Netzach manifested as arrogance, and the rationality of Hod degenerated into materialistic ambition.  Fittingly, the Hodic qualities of reason and communication were disrupted, resulting in the downfall of Netzachian expansion. A positive example of the Tower would be Mount Sinai.  Here the mountain is a natural “tower”, illuminated by flashes of lightning.  The outcome of this illumination is the shattering of old falsehoods.       28.  TZADI -- sekhel mutba’ Netzach-Yesod ·Natural mind.   By it is fulfilled the nature of all that exists under the sphere of the sun. ·south-above ·Aquarius ·meditation This Path and the next are connected with thought. This Path mediates between the expressive world of Netzach and the subconscious mind of Yesod.  This is the landscape of the universal mind as it exists submerged in the individual unconscious. The Tarot card corresponding to Tzadi is called “The Star”.  Its astrological sign is Aquarius, often called “the astrologers’ sign”.  This card hints at the psychic link between the subconscious mind and the universe. “Under the sphere of the sun” refers to the Moon, Mercury, and Venus collectively.  29.  QOPH -- sekhel mugsham Netzach-Malkhuth ·Physical mind.  It gives form to all bodies that materialize under the structure of all the spheres, according to their growth. ·south-below ·Pisces ·sleep More physical than Tzadi, the path denoted by Qoph is the world of bodily consciousness and unconsciousness.  It is the realm of sleep.  Its Tarot card is “The Moon”, indicating the body’s cycles and rhythms.  This is the link between the body and the world. The “Moon” card depicts a moon over a lake.  There are usually raindrops in the picture:  this is a play on the name of the Path, because the Hebrew word for “rain” (geshem) is related to the word for “body” or “physical”.   30.  RESH  -- sekhel klali Hod-Yesod ·General mind.  By it, the astrologers formulate the principles of the stars and constellations in their orbits, according to the perfection of their knowledge. ·south ·Sun ·fertility This is the rational, analytical side of the Path denoted by Tzadi.  More important, it represents an emergence into awareness and heightened consciousness.  Ginsburgh calls it the “art of clarification”.  This Path and the next are connected with speech.   31.  SHIN -- sekhel tamidi Hod-Malkhuth ·Perpetual mind.  It conducts the path of the sun and the moon according to their structure, each in its proper sphere. ·north-south axis ·fire This is the connection between the body and the rational mind.  The “sun” and “moon” represent logical and instinctive modes of thought respectively.    32.  TAV -- sekhel ne’evad Yesod-Malkhuth ·Worshiped mind.  It is prepared for the destruction of those who indulge in the idolatry of the seven planets. ·center ·Saturn ·dominion/servitude This seems like a strange way to end.  Condemning idolatry is typical in Jewish texts, but ending on a negative note is not.  Besides, why do we need a special “Path of Wisdom” to punish us for idolatry?  We ought to know better in the first place. Idolatry means being trapped in the form.  It means being a slave to the symbol -- and the name of the letter Tav means a sign or symbol.  Forms and symbols are essential; as we have seen, they are the gateways to wisdom, power, and fulfillment.  But their purpose is to help us interact with what is out there in the world.  This is the meaning of the path from Yesod to Malkhuth -- from principle to reality. And “The World” is the title of the Tarot card corresponding to Tav.  This card shows a figure, usually a nude woman, dancing.  In a word, this card stands for freedom.   Enslavement comes when we turn our learning into dogma, and limit our experience of the world to conform to what we already think we know.  Liberation comes from taking the knowledge gained in books and classrooms, and applying it to the realm of real life -- the World.  And not only that:  because someday, we all must be liberated from our physical bodies; so we must understand that the World itself is a symbol of the power of the infinite creative force beyond.

"       MEMORIES OF A FREE IRAQ. The Fire Last Time by Zainab Al-Suwaij  The New Republic Post date: 02.03.03  Issue date: 02.10.03  As war with Iraq draws closer, commentators, journalists, and policymakers frequently question whether the Iraqi people would really support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But that question has already been answered. Although Americans remember the Gulf war, many do not realize that, for a few momentous days immediately after it, much of Iraq rose up in open rebellion against Saddam's regime. In fact, 15 out of 18 Iraqi provinces rebelled. I was one of the rebels.   For over a decade, I have stayed silent about what I saw. But now, as the world considers freeing Iraq from Saddam's rule, I feel compelled to bear witness to the last time Iraqis tried to liberate their country.   In February 1991, I was living with my grandparents in Karbala, a city of roughly 350,000 an hour southwest of Baghdad. The Gulf war was raging, and my family and I often listened to Voice of America for news free of Iraqi-government control. We heard President George H.W. Bush repeatedly assure us that if the Iraqi people rose up against Saddam, the United States stood ready to help them. 'There's another way for the bloodshed to stop,' Bush had said, 'and that is for the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside.' I was excited by Bush's words, but, after two decades of living under the brutal rule of Saddam's Baath Party, it was impossible for me to imagine we would ever be liberated. Even though millions of Iraqis dreamed of overthrowing Saddam, we were afraid to speak about it and doubted anyone would ever come to help us. I felt the world had abandoned us.   If an uprising was going to break out, I thought, it certainly wasn't going to be in Karbala, where security was unusually tight, even for a police state. Saddam had special reason to worry about Karbala. For centuries, Karbala has been a sacred place for Shiite Muslims, who are largely shut out from the upper levels of Iraq's secular, Sunni-dominated regime. Karbala is home to two sacred shrines that honor two of the key figures in Shiite history, Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas; many elderly Shiites retire to Karbala to spend the last years of their lives as 'neighbors' to Imam Hussein before being buried in one of the city's vast cemeteries. Because of the shrines, Iran refrained from bombing Karbala during its war with Iraq, a decision that only made Saddam more suspicious of Karbala residents.   Because of the city's large percentage of Shiites, the Iraqi government has used every method possible to demonstrate its control of Karbala. Every year, on the anniversary of Imam Hussein's martyrdom, Shiites observe ten days of mourning; during this period, Shiites perform the Aza, a passion play that depicts events leading up to the imam's murder. When Saddam came to power, he banned public performances of the Aza. Saddam also left his mark on the shrines honoring Imam Hussein and Abbas, which were infiltrated by the secret police. Built around their two graves, the shrines were once elaborate constructions topped with golden domes, but now the gold tiles have been removed and replaced with counterfeit metal. Although the shrines remained open to worshippers, when I would visit them I saw rooms within the buildings that had been used by secret police for interrogation--signs the police were prepared to clamp down hard on any Shiite agitation.   Even by Iraqi standards, Karbala was claustrophobic--in Karbala, even more than in the rest of Iraq, you learned not to trust anyone. Though the secret police set up shop in the two shrines, they had a pervasive presence in all parts of the city. The city crawled with informers. Anyone you met--in the streets, in school, at the mosques--might be an agent of the secret police, whose ranks ranged from teenage boys to elderly grandmothers. At my high school, I felt enormous pressure to join Saddam's Baath Party. I was not allowed to receive my high school diploma unless I signed up for the party. I refused because I didn't want my name associated in any way with Saddam's crimes. The high school officials denied me my diploma and forced me to sign a document stating that if I joined any other political party, the regime had the right to kill me. This document was added to my school file, and I thereafter tried to keep a low profile because I felt informers were watching me.       n March 1, 1991, I was fasting and praying with other women in the shrine of Imam Hussein. That day, I was reading prayers for illiterate women, a custom I had performed since childhood. Suddenly, a woman ran into the mosque and announced, 'Our army has pulled out of Kuwait.'   I burst into tears--not out of regret for the Iraqi army, but because I had hoped Saddam's regime might fall while most of his military was in Kuwait. During the Gulf war, we frequently saw young men in the street who had deserted the Iraqi army in Kuwait and returned to their hometown. Now, I worried, with the war over, there would be less reason for people to desert the army, and the elite Republican Guard would return and increase Saddam's control over the country. My hopes of freedom seemed to fade.   I was still crying when I left the shrine. I was turning 20 the next day, and I suddenly understood that I had no future in Iraq. As long as Saddam ruled, I could not live as a free person. I had no diploma, I couldn't speak openly about my political and religious beliefs, and my relatives could--and did--disappear at any given minute. Iraq under Saddam was a dead end.   I cried all the way home. People stared at me on the street as tears soaked my hijab. It may be hard for non-Iraqis to understand why I was so distraught, why I could not imagine continuing to live under Saddam's rule. But the years of war with Iran, Kuwait, and now the United States and its allies, coupled with Saddam's brutal war against his own people, had sucked the life out of me. And the news that the army would be returning from Kuwait intact meant that my limited hope for freedom was now crushed.   Imam Hussein's shrine had always been my place of comfort, and, on March 3, I went back to pray. Walking along Shara'a Al Abbas, Karbala's main street, I noticed that the mood was tense. The street was filled with more secret police than usual. They stood around and talked nervously.   Afternoon prayers that day in Imam Hussein's shrine lasted only one hour, and then the soldiers immediately kicked us out. I had never seen the shrine shut down like this--the tension in Karbala was rising fast. As I left the shrine, I saw a tank and machine guns stationed in the center of the city. The moment I returned home, I tuned in to the Voice of Free Iraq, an opposition radio station that had started broadcasting out of Cyprus in January 1991, and learned that an uprising had started in Basra and spread north and east to the cities along the Iranian border. Evidently, people across Iraq had decided that now was the time to act, before all the troops could return from Kuwait. Here was a window to make a difference, while Saddam's army was still in retreat and the president of the United States was promising support. 'This is amazing,' I thought. 'Will our turn ever come?'       wo days later, on March 5, as I was having breakfast, our neighbor Umali came to see us. Umali's family was originally from Iran, and, although Saddam had expelled many people we thought were of Iranian origin years earlier, she had paid a bribe to continue living in Karbala. 'They are coming!' she told me. 'Who?' I asked. 'The uprising fighters. They have already liberated Basra and Najaf, and now they are coming to Karbala.' I didn't know who exactly these fighters were, but, as I would later see with my own eyes, they were a loose coalition of regular Iraqis of all backgrounds--soldiers who had deserted, high school students, and older people who could still remember a time before Baath Party rule--who had risen up with little organization and now were moving across the area.   I jumped up and ran outside. The streets were filled with troops, secret police, and heavy weaponry. Guns were drawn. Soldiers were shouting into loudspeakers, ordering everyone to return to their houses and shut their doors. To my surprise, dozens of young men were defying the soldiers and urging people to remain outside.   When I returned home to change into pants and boots, my grandfather tried to stop me from leaving. 'Come back!' he shouted at me. 'Don't do this. This will not take you anywhere.' My grandfather survived decades of Iraq's internal battles by refusing to get involved in politics. He knew that what was about to happen could lead to a bad ending.   Overcome with anger, I told myself that I had a choice. By joining the young men, I could show I wanted to live as a free person. A rebellion had begun in Karbala, and I made a conscious decision to be a part of it. As I left the house, I saw groups of men, mostly local Shiites, who had heard of the uprising in Basra and gathered in Karbala to join the rebellion. Many were teenagers, and they carried whatever they could find--sticks, axes, knives, even curtain rods. A few had guns. 'God is great!' they shouted. 'We swear by God, we will never forget [Imam] Hussein!'   I was the only woman in the street, surrounded by mobs of men. 'Who are you?' they asked me. 'What are you doing here? This isn't your place.' 'This is my fight, too,' I told them. 'I am with you.'   With makeshift weapons and our own bodies, we began to confront the Iraqi soldiers who had entered the town in recent days yet who were already weakened by weeks of allied bombing, desertions, and the army's withdrawal from Kuwait. The soldiers started firing on the crowd--the first time I had ever seen live shooting. Caught up in the frenzy of noise and excitement, I didn't run for cover. Instead, I kept shouting along with the others, 'Down with Saddam!' Years of anger within me came pouring out.   Even with its guns, the army was no match for us that day. The angry crowds surged toward the soldiers' trucks and jeeps despite the rain of bullets. They swarmed en masse all over the military's vehicles and forced the troops out of their cars so that the soldiers could not possibly shoot at all the waves of rebels. Many soldiers threw down their weapons and ran off down the street, chased by the crowd. Many were caught and some were beaten; most who were captured were taken to the Imam Hussein shrine, which became a makeshift headquarters for the rebels and a detention center for army troops. I saw one older soldier who escaped the crowds banging on my neighbor's door, crying. He asked to be hidden or at least given some civilian clothes that might save him.   With the army on the run, it became easier for us to get weapons. During the Gulf war, Saddam had stored many of his weapons in places the United States and its allies would never dare bomb: elementary and high schools. Guards who used to work at the schools began emptying the school storage rooms and passing us everything from Kalashnikov rifles to grenade launchers. The guns would be necessary: Though many of the soldiers had run off, I saw that some were still putting up resistance to the rebels, and they were increasingly joined by Baath Party civilian militias and members of the town's secret police. For the Baath members and the secret police, their existence depended on Saddam staying in power, so they holed up inside Karbala's city hall and other municipal buildings and fired into the crowds in the street, maiming and killing as many people as they could. Later that night, many attempted to flee but were killed or captured by the rebels.   By late afternoon on March 5, when the situation had calmed down a little, I returned home. My grandmother had been worried sick about me, but I told her not to worry. 'If I live, I want to live in freedom,' I said. 'Otherwise, why bother?' 'But,' she argued with me, 'none of this is organized!' I responded passionately, 'Remember what President Bush said? If we rise up against Saddam, the Americans will help us.'   I felt this was an historic moment for the Iraqi people, and I wanted to record it. So I grabbed my family's camcorder and started filming the scene in the streets, where people were dancing and shouting in celebration after many of the troops retreated. Cars honked, people handed out sweets, and women and children hugged and kissed. Walking around with the camcorder, I felt as if I were taping an enormous wedding celebration. Despite the joy, there were many people who had been killed and injured in the initial rush at the army troops. Wounded rebels, army soldiers, and Baath Party members lay in the streets. I told people to carry two of the injured men back to a mosque my family ran. But my grandfather, who wanted no part of the uprising, had taken the keys so that no one could bring the wounded inside. I went into our house, entered the mosque through a back passage, and opened the building's big blue doors. As they swung open, a crowd of what seemed to be hundreds of people rushed in, many limping because of their wounds. With the few supplies we had, we administered first aid. Some people suffered from severe chest and leg wounds and needed to go to the hospital, but nobody dared to drive in the midst of the persistent shooting.       s night fell and the city grew quiet, a great fear set in--a fear fostered by years of living in Iraq. We wondered who in the mosque was really with us and who was against us. Would someone burst into the mosque and try to kill us? Would someone amongst us turn on the group and inform the Baath Party members and other people allied with Saddam where we were? Most of us were strangers to each other. Some of the people in our group, of course, had worked for the secret police--with so many Iraqis in one room, some would have worked for the security services. I treated one secret policeman, Naji, who was shaking with fright as I touched him. He was convinced we were going to kill him as we tried to wrap his wounds. 'Don't be scared,' we told him. 'We are not like you.' Naji had expected us to act just like the Baath police. 'May God protect you,' he sighed in relief.   That night, I mobilized our family's servants to cook food, help clean up the blood in the mosque, and put out mattresses. I ran into the house, got pillows, and ripped the cotton out of them, which we used to dress the wounds.   All this time, my grandfather stayed in the house. Sometimes he would bang lightly on the mosque door and whisper, 'Make them leave. This will be bad for you. Saddam will come back.' What he was saying was logical, given Iraq's history, but I didn't want to listen. I was exulting in what I thought was a moment of freedom, and I pretended not to hear him and continued helping the wounded. Eventually he ignored us, and, when things got quieter, I sat with other members of the group in the prayer hall of the mosque while each person told his or her history. Soon we were telling jokes we recalled from the Voice of Free Iraq.   It may not sound dramatic, but talking together openly was a completely new experience for us. For years we had lived in a society of informers, where nobody could be trusted. Now, we were getting to know each other for the first time.   That first night of the uprising was the first time I ever saw Iraqis reveal themselves to one another and talk openly about who we were and what had happened to us and our families. Our neighbor, Said, a former army general, told us he had been jailed for ten years for refusing to join the Baath Party while he was in the military. I was shocked to find out he'd been in prison; I had always thought of him merely as our strange, aloof neighbor. Two of the injured men, Sami and Hazam, recounted their experiences. Years before, Sami had been jailed for no reason and had spent four years in prison. He described how prison guards had beaten him, tied him to a ceiling fan, and then turned it on. Hazam had also been imprisoned. He later joined the army to get out of prison but deserted when the military invaded Kuwait. Now he was hiding in Karbala.   That night, we also discussed some of our hopes and visions for the future of Iraq. A medical student named Ali, who had come to the mosque and volunteered to treat the wounded, joked, 'When we capture Saddam, we'll charge five dollars to everyone who wants to spit on him.' We all started laughing because previously nobody had ever dared to make jokes like this. Ali continued, 'If someone wants to kick him, ten dollars. That's how we'll raise the money to rebuild Iraq.'   We were sure it was only a matter of time before the Americans arrived, and we were already thinking about how to build a democratic society. We talked about all the people who had been thrown out of the country over the last four decades--Jews and Shiites. Many of these people had lived in Iraq for generations, but their property was confiscated when they were forced to leave. Some, of course, never even got the chance to leave--they were executed in Iraq. We spoke quietly so the injured could sleep.       n the morning, on March 6, we sent two men to get medicine from a nearby pharmacy and others to look for any ambulances that were still operating. Ali's sister was a pharmacist, and some men from our group smashed open her store, which had been boarded up as the uprising began, to obtain medical supplies. When they returned to the mosque, we were able to begin seriously treating the wounded and taking them to the hospital.   Despite our excitement, we could not forget our worries about the night before. While people were taking the wounded to the hospital, I made sure we cleaned up everything in the mosque. I told our family's servants, 'I don't want there to be any trace of blood or any evidence that people were here overnight.' After we scrubbed the floors, we gathered all of our makeshift bandages and burned them in our family's oven.   Later that morning, I walked over to the city jail. The front door was open, and most of the guards had fled, leaving the prisoners alone. At first, the remaining guards wouldn't let me in because I was a woman, but, when I insisted, they backed down. I explored the jail for over an hour. It was a huge building with many floors. People were wandering through the halls, and inmates were banging on the walls of their cells, yelling to be let out. There were prisoners from many countries--Kuwaitis, Saudis, Palestinians, Jordanians, Egyptians, and even a few Europeans who had been arrested during the invasion of Kuwait and shipped to Karbala. Although there were still a few cowed guards around, everyone was being freed by members of the uprising who had come to the jail over the past day. One man, a Kuwaiti, told me he had come to Iraq to check on his brother, a prisoner of war from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He was arrested and held for three months; prison guards tortured him every day. 'Get out of the city,' I told him. 'It's not safe.' I pointed him in the direction of the U.S.-held zone in southern Iraq.   Some of the older prisoners didn't even know what year it was. Some prisoners no longer remembered why they were imprisoned in the first place.   As I wandered around the jail, some of the liberated prisoners gave us a tour. I saw huge meat grinders that fed into a septic tank and rooms I believe were used for sexual abuse. Instruction manuals on how to use torture devices were posted on the wall. A terrible smell was everywhere. Here before me was the dark secret of Saddam's Iraq. I felt sick but free. Now, I thought, these rooms will never be used again.   Walking out into the street, I saw that people were still celebrating, but they were also waiting for U.S. support, support needed to prevent the army from returning and to allow the uprising to move to other cities in the heart of Iraq. People became anxious, not knowing what to expect. The strange reality of the uprising, with its hope and joy, its danger and uncertainty, unleashed a mix of emotions. Many of the rebels were eager to destroy the people who had terrorized us for years, and they tried to kill as many soldiers and government agents as possible. There were revenge killings in which families murdered the secret-police agents who had killed their relatives. When I visited the hospital on the second day of the uprising to give blood, I saw the corpse of Jabbar, a well-known local informer, lying in the hospital's courtyard. A local man wanted to use his car to run over Jabbar's dead body.   Other rebels showed mercy, protecting some government workers and helping them hide from angry mobs. It seemed to me that some of the uprising fighters tried not to imitate the ways of our oppressors. Instead of using the police station as their base, they used the two shrines. Instead of summarily executing all of Saddam's soldiers, informers, and secret agents in town, they arrested some--though they also killed many. I saw people cooking in the streets and giving out food to strangers. I had never seen Iraqis standing together like this, but then I had never seen Iraqis experience any semblance of freedom.       s the conflict in Karbala wore on, our fear intensified. By the third day of the uprising, it was only a matter of time, we thought, before Saddam's troops arrived en masse to destroy us. Where were the Americans who had promised to come to our aid? Depression began to set in. We waited and waited--for the Americans, for international help, for food, for water, and for medical supplies. The hours grew longer and longer.   By the fifth day, March 9, regiments of the Iraqi army loyal to Saddam arrived on the outskirts of Karbala and started bombing the city from a distance. Under cover of artillery fire, they began sending deployments of soldiers into the city. When I returned home, I saw two soldiers trying to shoot my neighbor, Said. I yelled at him to be careful as shots hit his hand. One of the soldiers shot at me, and the bullet grazed my cheek. At first I didn't even notice it. But Said called out to me, 'My daughter, something is coming out of your face.' I touched my hand to my cheek and felt blood.   Around 4:30 in the afternoon, tanks from the Republican Guard, Saddam's most devoted troops, started rumbling down Karbala's main street. A group of us gathered outside as Said, the former general, assigned positions to the men. 'I don't want to hear a single shot until all the tanks are in,' he told us. 'Tanks are good in deserts and open spaces, but they're terrible in the streets. Don't attack until all the tanks are trapped.' Said had been in the army when it still had a strong British influence.   Said asked for volunteers to bomb one of the tanks. 'Who will stay with me?' he asked. I stepped forward, but he was skeptical. 'You've been shot and you're a woman,' he told me. 'But you need me here now, and you don't have anyone else,' I replied. He reluctantly agreed to let me try.   I went up to the roof above the tank I was assigned to bomb. I watched as the other fighters down the street ambushed the tanks, one by one. Suddenly it was my turn. I pulled the pin and threw the grenade. The grenade hit its target. There were fires and explosions everywhere. There was a jolt through my body. For three hours I couldn't move and stayed hidden behind the wall; I just sat there praying. What had become of me? A 20-year-old woman, desperate for a future that was now slipping away, tossing grenades and vainly trying to hold off the tragedy that I realized was about to come.   By now, it was clear the Americans were not coming. President Bush had promised to help us if we rose up against Saddam, and we had believed him. But the help never arrived. American troops did not interfere as Saddam turned his helicopters and tanks against us, sending more and more regiments of his troops to Karbala. With no commerce and no help from the world, our supplies were running out, our energy was gone, and our momentum had disappeared. Troops loyal to Saddam began swarming through the city as the residents of Karbala fled. Within a few days, the uprising was crushed. Now it was about our own survival. We said goodbye, cried, and spread out on our own.   Saddam assigned the responsibility for Karbala to his son-in-law, Hussein Kamel, who quickly made an example of the resistance fighters, having troops shoot on sight anyone accused of being in the resistance. Kamel also let the bodies of those rebels shot during the uprising lie untouched in the streets as a reminder to the populace of what happened to people who rose up. I saw stray dogs approach the bodies and start eating them.   To escape Karbala, 20 family members, friends, and I crammed into a car built for five. The son of an army general, who was a close friend, drove us out of Karbala through a hail of bullets. At checkpoints just outside the city, guards screamed at us, but, when the driver showed his army credentials, we passed through.   The next few months were difficult, as the secret police hunted uprising fighters across the country. People told me that they entered our home in Karbala and took everything. Friends in Karbala told me that secret police rounded up people regardless of whether they had fought in the uprising. One family friend returned home to his family in Karbala months later. The next day, the secret police took him to prison. Someone had told them he participated in the uprising, and he was tortured for 45 days, each day denying their accusations. One day a taxi driver knocked on the family's door. 'Pull your son out of my car,' the driver said, 'because he can't move.' In prison, the family friend had lost his mind. He stayed curled up, friends told me, crying like a baby and yelling, 'I want my mommy!'   We could hardly get beyond Karbala's outskirts, so I hid in a small home outside the city, covering my face and sleeping in a secret room. All my hopes and dreams had seemed so close, but now they were crushed. The spirit had been sucked out of me, but, to keep from getting depressed while I hid, I spent hours writing poetry, waiting for the opportunity to escape. I kept thinking about the bizarre window of freedom I had just experienced: Iraq without Saddam's rule, the joy of liberation, the anger of many people after two decades of repression, the way in which we spontaneously organized, the feeling of being open with neighbors and complete strangers, the sight of the prisoners and the human meat grinders.   Eventually, the border to Jordan was reopened, and I seized the chance to flee Iraq. At the border, I had to bribe the border guard to ignore my name on a list of people who were not allowed to leave the country. I was out, but I felt dead inside.       he surviving veterans of the uprising scattered across Iraq and around the world. Sometimes I hear from a fellow refugee in California or Michigan who also participated in the uprising. But mostly there is silence. We thought if we forgot about the past--or at least stopped talking about it--it would go away. But now the weapons-inspection crisis has reached a boil. Could it possibly be that President George W. Bush will bring justice and liberation where his father failed?   America's showdown with Saddam has evoked all the emotions from March 1991 that I have tried so long to forget. They remind me of the diary I kept during the uprising. I made a point of writing in it every day because I believed we were making history. I wanted to preserve those moments so that I would never forget the first precious days of freedom. I wrote every day at noon, if I could, or at night, by candlelight. After the uprising failed, when I was on the run and cut off from my family, this diary was all that I had.   The night before I left Iraq, I burned my diary in an oven, page by page. Anyone caught with such a document would be killed. In all, I burned over 200 pages--full of details about what I had seen and done in Karbala. As the pages went up in flames, tears streamed down my face.   For many years, I have tried to forget what I wrote in those pages. But I can never erase those memories. Sometimes I feel I am back in Karbala. We are waiting for the Americans once again.       Zainab Al-Suwaij is executive director of the American Islamic Congress (http://www.tnr.com/www.aicongress.org). source:  http://www.aicongress.org/policy/articles/TNR1.htm   Copyright 2002, The New Republic    ",5.87,6.098,6.847,0.516,0.508,73.4,15.4,0.114,0.825,0.061,8.901,10.75,4.379,2
"       Excerpts from the HRW report:  [prologue] A Petition  In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate   The Venerable Chief and Leader, the Honorable Saddam Hussein (May God Protect Him), President of the Republic and Head of the Honorable Revolutionary Command Council:  Struggling Comrade, I greet you. And I present myself to you as a devoted citizen.  I implore you in the name of Ba'athist Justice to hear my plight, which has deprived me of sleep night and day. For I lost all hope and when I had no one left to turn to except yourselves, I came to you with my problem, which may be of some concern to you.  Sir:  I, the undersigned, Assi Mustafa Ahmad, who returned as a prisoner of war on August 24, 1990, am a reserve soldier born in 1955. I participated in the Glorious Battle of Saddam's Qadissiyat [the war with Iran] in the Sector of Al-Shoush and was taken prisoner on March 27, 1982. I remained a prisoner until the day that the decision to exchange prisoners of war was issued. Then I returned to the homeland and kissed the soil of the Beloved Motherland and knelt in front of the portrait of our Victorious Leader and President Saddam Hussein. In my heart I felt a tremendous longing to return to my family. They would delight in seeing me, and I would delight in seeing them, and we would all be caught up in an overwhelming joy that could not be described.  However, I found my home completely empty. My wife and my kids were not there. What a catastrophe! What a horror! I was told that the whole family had fallen into the hands of the Anfal forces in the Anfal operation conducted in the Northern Region, under the leadership of Comrade Ali Hassan al-Majid. I know nothing of their fate. They are: 1. Azimah Ali Ahmad, born 1955/ My wife.  2. Jarou Assi Mustafa, born 1979/ My daughter.  3. Faraydoun Assi Mustafa, born 1981/ My son.  4. Rukhoush Assi Mustafa, born 1982/ My son. I have thus come to you with this petition, hoping that you would take pity on me and inform me of their fate. May God grant you success and protect you. You have my thanks and respect.

Your wife and children were lost during the Anfal Operations that took place in the Northern Region in 1988.  Yours truly,  [signature]  Saadoun Ilwan Muslih  Chief, Bureau of the Presidency        [from the introduction to the HRW report] ... With this latest report, painstakingly compiled over eighteen months, Middle East Watch believes it can now demonstrate convincingly a deliberate intent on the part of the government of President Saddam Hussein to destroy, through mass murder, part of Iraq's Kurdishminority. The Kurds are indisputably a distinct ethnic group2, separate from the majority Arab population of Iraq, and they were targeted during the Anfal as Kurds. Two government instruments -- the October 1987 national census and the declaration of 'prohibited areas', covering more and more of the Kurdish countryside like a crazy-patterned quilt -- were institutional foundations of this policy. These instruments were implemented against the background of nearly two decades of government-directed 'Arabization', in which mixed-race districts, or else lands that Baghdad regarded as desirable or strategically important, saw their Kurdish population diluted by Arab migrant farmers provided with ample incentives to relocate, and guarded by government troops.  The Kurds bear arms as a matter of course, and have regularly resorted to them when thwarted in their demands for greater political and cultural autonomy. Indeed, the Anfal cannot be understood without an awareness of the half century of Kurdish armed struggle against the central government of Iraq, through various political regimes. In the early 1970s, the Ba'athists, still uncertain about their hold on power, went much further than their predecessors in recognizing those demands --offering a substantial degree of self-government and recognizing the Kurds' separate identity in a new Provisional Constitution. That constitution is still in force, and Baghdad still maintains the fiction that 'its' autonomous region, with its own Kurdish administration, is in force. This puppet administration sits in government-controlled Kirkuk, and regularly denounces the 'foreign-backed usurpers' in the Kurdish rebel-run territory.  The logic of the Anfal, however, cannot be divorced either from the Iran-Iraq War. After 1986, both the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the two major parties, received support from the Iranian government and sometimes took part in joint military raids against Iraqi government positions; the KDP also had a rear base inside Iran. That Baghdad was entitled to engage in counterinsurgency action, to wrest control over Iraq's northeast border region and much of the mountainous interior from rebels, is undisputed. What Middle East Watch contends is that, in doing so, the central government went much further than was required to restore its authoritythrough legitimate military action. In the process, Saddam Hussein's regime committed a panoply of war crimes, together with crimes against humanity and genocide.  While many readers will be familiar with the attack on Halabja, in March 1988, in which up to 5,000 Kurdish civilians died -- the incident caused a brief international furor -- they may be surprised to learn that the first use of poison gas against the Kurds by the central government occurred eleven months earlier. All told, Middle East Watch has recorded forty separate attacks on Kurdish targets, some of them involving multiple sorties over several days, between April 1987 and August 1988. Each of these attacks were war crimes, involving the use of a banned weapon; the fact that noncombatants were often the victims added to the offence.  By our estimate, in Anfal at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 100,000 persons, many of them women and children, were killed out of hand between February and September 1988. Their deaths did not come in the heat of battle -- 'collateral damage' in the military euphemism. Nor were they acts of aberration by individual commanders whose excesses passed unnoticed, or unpunished, by their superiors. Rather, these Kurds were systematically put to death in large numbers on the orders of the central government in Baghdad -- days, sometimes weeks, after being rounded-up in villages marked for destruction or else while fleeing from army assaults in 'prohibited areas'.  While a minority had been combatants, or else served as a 'backing force' for the rebel parties, the vast majority of the dead were noncombatants whose death resulted from the fact that they inhabited districts declared off-limits by the Iraqi government. Underlining the deliberate, preplanned nature of the Anfal, those responsible for their murder by firing squad were usually members of élite security units unconnected to the forces responsible for the Kurds' capture; in other words, while one hand would sweep, the other would dispose of what the regime considered to be the 'garbage'. ...   [complete text of Note on Methodology] A Note on Methodology The Methodological Approach to Documentary, Testimonial and Forensic Evidence Used in This Report   Testimonial Evidence   To a large measure this report is based on testimonies obtained in Iraqi Kurdistan from eyewitnesses to (and often victims of) Anfal-related abuses. Two Middle East Watch researchers and an assistant spent a total of six months in the Kurdish areas on three separate missions between April 1992 and April 1993, conducting approximately 350 in-depth interviews. The methodology they used in obtaining this testimonial evidence is described below.  Prior to its first mission in April 1992, the research team designed a questionnaire on the basis of our understanding of Anfal, still limited at that time, and following discussions with regional experts and statisticians. This questionnaire was constructed with a view to facilitating the tabulation and quantification of data concerning the forced displacement and/or disappearance of Kurds during Anfal.  The team tested the questionnaire through a small number of interviews shortly after its arrival in the area, and immediately determined that the questions did not take account of a number of factors, including specific historical events that are instrumental to understanding the circumstances that surrounded Anfal, as well as the methodical nature of the operation. The team then revised the questionnaire drastically and began its research, only making minor adjustments to the basic design in the weeks that followed.  The purpose of the research was to find out as much as possible about Anfal and about the people who were said to have disappeared during and after the operation. The research population was divided into three groups: (1) direct eyewitnesses to Anfal-related abuses; (2) persons active in (para-)military units, either Kurdish guerrillas (peshmerga), former military officers, or leaders (mustashars) of the pro-governmentKurdish militias; and (3) staff of local and international non-governmental organizations and officials of the local Kurdish administration, all of whom were intimately familiar with the situation on the ground before, during and after Anfal.  Because of the particular nature of Iraqi policy vis-a-vis rural Kurds in the 1980s, most eyewitnesses to Anfal were to be found in the large housing complexes (mujamma'at) in the valleys of northern Iraq. After the Iraqi government withdrew from a large part of the Kurdish region at the end of October 1991, villagers in some areas began returning to their destroyed villages to farm the lands and, sometimes, to rebuild their homes. The research team visited as many of the complexes as possible, as well as some of the (partially rebuilt) villages. In all cases, the operative question was: 'Where can we find the Anfals?' (Anfalakan, in Kurdish). Local residents would then guide the team to a house where Anfalakan were said to be living, and some initial questioning was done to ascertain that the people were indeed 'Anfals' and not persons who had been relocated there from their villages during earlier stages of village destruction and had not been affected directly by Anfal. This method had a snowball effect: one family of Anfalakan would lead the team to another, until the team felt it had exhaustively covered a particular geographic area of Anfal.  Essentially, the team obtained eyewitness testimonies in three different ways: (1) by visiting places of residence randomly and asking for Anfalakan (the most frequent method); (2) by pursuing specific leads; and (3) occasionally, by responding to unsolicited requests to be interviewed. In the beginning, the sole criterion employed in deciding whether or not a person should be interviewed was whether the person was present in a military-demarcated area during Anfal and had lost relatives as a result of the campaign. In later stages of the research, when clear patterns had started to emerge, the search was more specifically for persons from certain Anfal areas, i.e., those about which the team had insufficient data, or those where particularly egregious abuses, like chemical weapons attacks, had taken place. In addition, a number of interviews were conducted at that time with people who had been in Anfal areas during Anfal but whose families had managed to escape unhurt, as well as with people who had experienced various forms of human rights abuses in the periods immediately preceding and following Anfal (1987 and 1989).  The team specifically sought out one sub-population of eyewitnesses: those who had been arrested in Anfal and taken to massexecution sites (then and now in areas that are controlled by the Iraqi government) from where they had managed to escape and return to safety. The testimonies of these execution survivors have proven crucial in the effort of Middle East Watch to provide evidence that the vast majority of those detained during Anfal, whose fate is officially said to be unknown, were actually killed. The team was able to locate seven such Anfal survivors, as well as one person who had survived an execution three months after Anfal. Some of these survivors did not want their identities to be known because, they said, they feared future government reprisal. One of the eight, Taymour, had already been interviewed by local Kurdish television, as well as by foreign journalists on numerous occasions. A second one, Hussein, had given testimony to the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq, Mr. Max van der Stoel, during the latter's visit to the area earlier in 1992. Four were located through local peshmerga commanders who had heard of their stories. The remaining two were found through the testimony of one of the survivors who had been in the same group as them at the time of the execution.  Invariably, respondents were eager to tell the team what had happened to them. In almost all cases, these people had not been interviewed about their experiences before. All freely gave their names, and only some requested that their identities be concealed for publication. Apart from the small number of persons who requested that their names be changed, all names referred to in this report are genuine. The team taped most interviews on audio-cassette and took photographs (slides) of the respondents afterwards. In the case of important interviews, the team asked the respondent's permission to videotape either highlights or a full second interview (as in the case of some of the execution survivors). The team traveled with one or more Kurdish interpreters at all times. These persons were asked to provide literal translations from English to Kurdish (Surani or Kurmanji dialects) and back. In addition, some interviews were conducted by team members directly in English or in Arabic.  In virtually all cases, the team interviewed a single person at a time, although close relatives were often present during the interview. The questions covered the following topics:  1. Personal history before Anfal (personal status, family members, property, occupation, religious and tribal affiliations, etc.)  2. Information concerning the village in which the person was living before Anfal (location, size of population, main tribe, main economic activity, availability of goverment services and facilities, etc.)  3. Military activity in and around the village before Anfal, and government policies affecting the inhabitants (presence of peshmerga, government attacks, administrative and economic blockade, casualties, 1987 population census, etc.)  4. Events during Anfal (nature of government attack, circumstances of arrest, route of transport, selection process, conditions of detention, casualties, circumstances of release, etc.)  5. Living conditions after Anfal and attempts, if any, to locate missing relatives.  Usually, topics 1 and 2 followed a fairly strict question-and-answer format, while topics 3, 4 and 5 allowed for greater flexibility: the person was asked to recount events as he or she remembered them, and the team would (a) only ask questions for clarification about specific dates, locations or identities; or (b) pursue at some length a narrative of particular interest to the project; or (c) probe any contradictions that might appear in the testimony, or between the testimony and a previous one.  Due to the high incidence of illiteracy in rural Kurdistan, as well as the local population's particular way of marking time, the team encountered considerable difficulty in its attempts to establish exact dates for specific events, or particular chronologies, on the basis of interviews with individual villagers. Dates would often be related to religious feasts, for example. On the whole, though, after numerous interviews, the team was satisfied that it had obtained an accurate picture of the separate stages of Anfal and the events that transpired within these stages. Some of these dates have subsequently been substantiated in documents captured by the Kurds from the Iraqi intelligence agencies during the March 1991 uprising.  Generally, the team determined the accuracy of individual accounts by virtue of their internal consistency, their general consistency with the overall patterns that emerged during the project, including with other types of evidence, and their specific consistency with a follow-upinterview conducted, in a few cases, with the same respondent. In the case of all interviews, the team tried to obtain supporting evidence. This included personal documents that were in the possession of the respondents (for example, 'movement permits' and administrative orders), or an inspection of the site described (e.g. a prison, or a village that had been subjected to a chemical attack). As a result of this procedure, a small number of interviews, or segments thereof, were discarded or left unused, either because the testimony was not deemed to be reliable or sufficient supporting evidence was not immediately available.  * * *   Documentary Evidence   In the March 1991 popular uprising in northern Iraq, Kurdish civilians and members of the Kurdish political parties stormed and took control of offices of the Iraqi government and its agencies, including the various intelligence agencies. Several of these buildings were heavily damaged, or even burned to the ground, but others survived unscathed. The Kurds thus came into possession of the inventories of many of these facilities. Matters taken include large quantities of documents, logs and registers, as well as audiotapes, videotapes, films and photographs.  In the days before the uprising was crushed by advancing Iraqi troops, the Kurdish parties succeeded in removing the majority of the documents they had captured from the towns to strongholds in the mountains. In the spring of 1992, one of the two largest parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), agreed to a tripartite arrangement in which Middle East Watch and the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee were the other two partners. Under this arrangement, the PUK agreed to send the documents in its possession to the United States for research and analysis; the Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed to turn the documents into official records of the U.S. Congress and store them in the facilities of the U.S. National Archives; and Middle East Watch agreed to conduct research on the documents for human rights purposes, including the pursuit of a genocide case before the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  The PUK cache consists of fourteen tons of documents contained in 847 boxes. The total number of pages has been estimated at over four million. In May 1992, the PUK placed these documents in the temporary custody of Middle East Watch and they were then flown, in the presence of the director of Middle East Watch, to the United States. In Washington, D.C., the documents were then handed over to the U.S. National Archives and placed in its storage facilities, while remaining under the joint custody of the PUK and Middle East Watch.  At the end of October 1992, a Middle East Watch-led team of researchers began the task of screening, cataloguing, and analyzing these documents. Important documents were pulled out, photocopied and translated, and a number of these have been included in this report. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iraq, Mr. Max van der Stoel, has also made use of some of the documents found by Middle East Watch, in his report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in March 1993.  The vast majority of the documents are from two main locations: Suleimaniyeh governorate and its districts; and Erbil governorate and its districts, especially the qadha of Shaqlawa. Almost all hail from the offices of Iraq's General Security Directorate (Mudiriyat al-Amn al-Ameh) in these locations, with a smattering of documents belonging to the General Military Intelligence Directorate (Mudiriyat al-Istikhbarat al-Askariyeh al-Ameh) and the Ba'ath Party. Generally, the documents are either file folders or pages tied together with shoelaces between two hard covers. There are also a number of bound ledgers. Due to the conditions that prevailed at the time of the uprising, especially in Suleimaniyeh, a number of the documents have completely fallen apart, and individual pages have been burned, trampled upon, muddied, or, in many cases, torn. The majority of the documents are in good order, however.  All documents, handwritten or typewritten, are in good and legible Arabic. They cover a wide variety of subjects that can most easily be divided into three main categories:  (1) administrative matters concerning agency staff: salaries, vacations, promotions, gun permits, disciplinary actions, etc.  (2) Personal information: These are files containing information on agency staff, ordinary citizens, or suspected members of Kurdish resistance parties. They include secret background checks, as well as records of investigations and interrogations. A number of files containvirtual life histories, some concluding with execution orders and death certificates.  (3) Reports on events in the area, and policy statements: These two types of documents are often mixed in together, and include reports on Amn and military actions undertaken against the peshmerga; reports on peshmerga activity in a particular area; and official orders and instructions that are being passed on down through the ranks.  Although the three categories generally appear separately in the documents, it does happen that a copy of an important order concerning the government's policy vis-a-vis the Kurds will appear in a person's secret file. Sometimes, evidence of abuse is either fragmentary and embedded in a larger text that outwardly seems innocuous, or phrased in such euphemistic terms that an untrained eye would have difficulty in recognizing it. The task of the Middle East Watch-led team, then, has essentially been to sift through these tons of documents in search of hidden nuggets.  * * *   Forensic Evidence   A team of forensic investigators was sent by Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights to Iraqi Kurdistan in May-June 1992. The team consisted of forensic investigators trained in forensic anthropology, archeology, and law, who had carried out exhumations of graves in several countries, including Argentina, Chile, El Salvador and Guatemala. It carried out exhumations of graves at three sites in Iraqi Kurdistan: at the village of Koreme, the village of Birjinni, and the cemetery of a complex of Anfal survivors outside the city of Erbil.  In its investigations, the team followed internationally accepted standards set forth in the United Nations 'Model Protocol for a Legal Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions' (the 'Minnesota Protocol').1 The full results of the team's investigations arefound in Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, The Anfal Campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan: The Destruction of Koreme, January 1993, and its methodology at each site is described below.  Koreme Site:  The team undertook the exhumation of a mass grave at the destroyed village of Koreme containing the skeletal remains of twenty-six men and boys, all of whom had died by gunfire at close range in a line indicating execution by firing squad. The team archaeologist directed the survey of the destroyed village, mapping the village as it stood before destruction, using standard archeological survey techniques; in addition, the team archeologist directed the collection and mapping of cartridge casings to determine the pattern of weapons firing at the execution site. The team's lead anthropologist directed the exhumation of the gravesite at Koreme, using standard exhumation techniques to preserve the skeletons and other artifacts. Investigations were carried out at the morgue at Dohuk General Hospital to determine the number of different individuals in the grave; sex, age, and other identifying marks; and manner of death. The team's lawyers directed interviews with survivors and other villagers to give a narrative of events corroborated by scientific evidence.  Birjinni Site:  The team carried out archeological surveys and exhumations of graves at the destroyed village of Birjinni which, according to surviving villagers, had been bombed in August 1988 with chemical weapons. The team archeologist carried out standard surveys of the ruined village. The forensic anthropologists exhumed the graves of persons reported to have died from inhalation of chemical agents. The team's lawyers conducted interviews with surviving villagers to obtain their account of events. In addition, the team took soil and other samples from the craters where chemical weapons were reported to have impacted. In 1993, the British Ministry of Defense chemical weapons laboratory at Porton Down reported discovering degradation products of mustard gas and nerve agents in samples taken from these sites. This is the first instance of a chemical weapons attack being proved on the basis of chemical residues left behind at the impact site.  Erbil Site:  The team undertook exhumations at the graveyard of a complex where survivors of the Anfal were taken. The gravesite was surveyed by the archeological team in order to make determinations of the ratio of adult and child graves in the cemetery. The forensic scientists exhumed three children's graves, one of them reported to have been made by a survivor from the village of Koreme and containing his infant sister. The exhumation of that grave corroborated his account, and contained the skeletal remains of a girl about one-year old, with evidence of malnutrition.  ______   1 Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, 1991.       [complete text of Introduction]  Introduction  This report is a narrative account of a campaign of extermination against the Kurds of northern Iraq. It is the product of over a year and a half of research, during which a team of Middle East Watch researchers has analyzed several tons of captured Iraqi government documents and carried out field interviews with more than 350 witnesses, most of them survivors of the 1988 campaign known as Anfal. It concludes that in that year the Iraqi regime committed the crime of genocide.  Anfal--'the Spoils'--is the name of the eighth sura of the Koran. It is also the name given by the Iraqis to a series of military actions which lasted from February 23 until September 6, 1988. While it is impossible to understand the Anfal campaign without reference to the final phase of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, Anfal was not merely a function of that war. Rather, the winding-up of the conflict on Iraq's terms was the immediate historical circumstance that gave Baghdad the opportunity to bring to a climax its longstanding efforts to bring the Kurds to heel. For the Iraqi regime's anti-Kurdish drive dated back some fifteen years or more, well before the outbreak of hostilities between Iran and Iraq.  Anfal was also the most vivid expression of the 'special powers' granted to Ali Hassan al-Majid, a cousin of President Saddam Hussein and secretary general of the Northern Bureau of Iraq's Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party. From March 29, 1987 until April 23, 1989, al-Majid was granted power that was equivalent, in Northern Iraq, to that of the President himself, with authority over all agencies of the state. Al-Majid, who is known to this day to Kurds as 'Ali Anfal' or 'Ali Chemical,' was the overlord of the Kurdish genocide. Under his command, the central actors in Anfal were the First and Fifth Corps of the regular Iraqi Army, the General Security Directorate (Mudiriyat al-Amn al-Ameh) and Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat). The pro-government Kurdish militia known as the National Defense Battalions, or jahsh, assisted in important auxiliary tasks.1 But the integrated resources of the entire military, security andcivilian apparatus of the Iraqi state were deployed, in al-Majid's words, 'to solve the Kurdish problem and slaughter the saboteurs.'2      Supplementary Materials   • The Anfal Campaign, Other Key Reports on Iraq  • Give Iraqis real justice -- not a U.S. puppet show  • Iraq: Killings, Expulsions on the Rise in Kirkuk   More on Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan     The campaigns of 1987-1989 were characterized by the following gross violations of human rights:  · mass summary executions and mass disappearance of many tens of thousands of non-combatants, including large numbers of women and children, and sometimes the entire population of villages;  · the widespread use of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent GB, or Sarin, against the town of Halabja as well as dozens of Kurdish villages, killing many thousands of people, mainly women and children;  · the wholesale destruction of some 2,000 villages, which are described in government documents as having been 'burned,' 'destroyed,' 'demolished' and 'purified,' as well as at least a dozen larger towns and administrative centers (nahyas and qadhas);  · the wholesale destruction of civilian objects by Army engineers, including all schools, mosques, wells and other non-residential structures in the targeted villages, and a number of electricity substations;  · looting of civilian property and farm animals on a vast scale by army troops and pro-government militia;  · arbitrary arrest of all villagers captured in designated 'prohibited areas' (manateq al-mahdoureh), despite the fact that these were their own homes and lands;  · arbitrary jailing and warehousing for months, in conditions of extreme deprivation, of tens of thousands of women, children and elderly people, without judicial order or any cause other than their presumed sympathies for the Kurdish opposition. Many hundreds of them were allowed to die of malnutrition and disease;  · forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of villagers upon the demolition of their homes, their release from jail or return from exile; these civilians were trucked into areas of Kurdistan far from their homes and dumped there by the army with only minimal governmental compensation or none at all for their destroyed property, or any provision for relief, housing, clothing or food, and forbidden to return to their villages of origin on pain of death. In these conditions, many died within a year of their forced displacement;  · destruction of the rural Kurdish economy and infrastructure.  Like Nazi Germany, the Iraqi regime concealed its actions in euphemisms. Where Nazi officials spoke of 'executive measures,' 'special actions' and 'resettlement in the east,' Ba'athist bureaucrats spoke of 'collective measures,' 'return to the national ranks' and 'resettlement in the south.' But beneath the euphemisms, Iraq's crimes against the Kurds amount to genocide, the 'intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.'3  * * * The campaigns of 1987-1989 are rooted deep in the history of the Iraqi Kurds. Since the earliest days of Iraqi independence, the country's Kurds--who today number more than four million--have fought either for independence or for meaningful autonomy. But they have never achieved the results they desired.  In 1970, the Ba'ath Party, anxious to secure its precarious hold on power, did offer the Kurds a considerable measure of self-rule, far greater than that allowed in neighboring Syria, Iran or Turkey. But the regime defined the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in such a way as deliberately to exclude the vast oil wealth that lies beneath the fringes of the Kurdish lands. The Autonomous Region, rejected by the Kurds and imposed unilaterally by Baghdad in 1974, comprised the three northern governorates of Erbil, Suleimaniyeh and Dohuk. Covering some 14,000square miles -- roughly the combined area of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island -- this was only half the territory that the Kurds considered rightfully theirs. Even so, the Autonomous Region had real economic significance, since it accounted for fully half the agricultural output of a largely desert country that is sorely deficient in domestic food production.  In the wake of the autonomy decree, the Ba'ath Party embarked on the 'Arabization' of the oil-producing areas of Kirkuk and Khanaqin and other parts of the north, evicting Kurdish farmers and replacing them with poor Arab tribesmen from the south. Northern Iraq did not remain at peace for long. In 1974, the long-simmering Kurdish revolt flared up once more under the leadership of the legendary fighter Mullah Mustafa Barzani, who was supported this time by the governments of Iran, Israel, and the United States. But the revolt collapsed precipitately in 1975, when Iraq and Iran concluded a border agreement and the Shah withdrew his support from Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). After the KDP fled into Iran, tens of thousands of villagers from the Barzani tribe were forcibly removed from their homes and relocated to barren sites in the desert south of Iraq. Here, without any form of assistance, they had to rebuild their lives from scratch.  In the mid and late 1970s, the regime again moved against the Kurds, forcibly evacuating at least a quarter of a million people from Iraq's borders with Iran and Turkey, destroying their villages to create a cordon sanitaire along these sensitive frontiers. Most of the displaced Kurds were relocated into mujamma'at, crude new settlements located on the main highways in army-controlled areas of Iraqi Kurdistan. The word literally means 'amalgamations' or 'collectivities.' In their propaganda, the Iraqis commonly refer to them as 'modern villages'; in this report, they are generally described as 'complexes.' Until 1987, villagers relocated to the complexes were generally paid some nominal cash compensation, but were forbidden to move back to their homes.  After 1980, and the beginning of the eight-year Iran-Iraq War, many Iraqi garrisons in Kurdistan were abandoned or reduced in size, and their troops transferred to the front. In the vacuum that was left, the Kurdish peshmerga--'those who face death'--once more began to thrive. The KDP, now led by one of Barzani's sons, Mas'oud, had revived its alliance with Teheran, and in 1983 KDP units aided Iranian troops in their capture of the border town of Haj Omran. Retribution was swift: in a lightning operation against the complexes that housed the relocatedBarzanis, Iraqi troops abducted between five and eight thousand males aged twelve or over. None of them have ever been seen again, and it is believed that after being held prisoner for several months, they were all killed. In many respects, the 1983 Barzani operation foreshadowed the techniques that would be used on a much larger scale during the Anfal campaign. And the absence of any international outcry over this act of mass murder, despite Kurdish efforts to press the matter with the United Nations and Western governments, must have emboldened Baghdad to believe that it could get away with an even larger operation without any adverse reaction. In these calculations, the Ba'ath Party was correct.  Even more worrisome to Baghdad was the growing closeness between the Iranians and the KDP's major Kurdish rival, Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The Ba'ath regime had conducted more than a year of negotiations with the PUK between 1983-1985, but in the end these talks failed to bear fruit, and full-scale fighting resumed. In late 1986 Talabani's party concluded a formal political and military agreement with Teheran.  By this time the Iraqi regime's authority over the North had dwindled to control of the cities, towns, complexes and main highways. Elsewhere, the peshmerga forces could rely on a deep-rooted base of local support. Seeking refuge from the army, thousands of Kurdish draft-dodgers and deserters found new homes in the countryside. Villagers learned to live with a harsh economic blockade and stringent food rationing, punctuated by artillery shelling, aerial bombardment and punitive forays by the Army and the paramilitary jahsh. In response, the rural Kurds built air-raid shelters in front of their homes and spent much of their time in hiding in the caves and ravines that honeycomb the northern Iraqi countryside. For all the grimness of this existence, by 1987 the mountainous interior of Iraqi Kurdistan was effectively liberated territory. This the Ba'ath Party regarded as an intolerable situation.  * * * With the granting of emergency powers to al-Majid in March 1987, the intermittent counterinsurgency against the Kurds became a campaign of destruction. As Raul Hilberg observes in his monumental history of the Holocaust:  A destruction process has an inherent pattern. There is only one way in which a scattered group can effectively be destroyed. Three steps are organic in the operation:  Definition  |  |  Concentration (or seizure)  |  |  Annihilation   This is the invariant structure of the basic process, for no group can be killed without a concentration or seizure of the victims, and no victims can be segregated before the perpetrator knows who belongs to the group.4  The Kurdish genocide of 1987-1989, with the Anfal campaign as its centerpiece, fits Hilberg's paradigm to perfection.  * * * In the first three months after assuming his post as secretary general of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau, Ali Hassan al-Majid began the process of definition of the group that would be targeted by Anfal, and vastly expanded the range of repressive activities against all rural Kurds. He decreed that 'saboteurs' would lose their property rights, suspended the legal rights of all the residents of prohibited villages, and began ordering the execution of first-degree relatives of 'saboteurs' and of wounded civilians whose hostility to the regime had been determined by the intelligence services.  In June 1987, al-Majid issued two successive sets of standing orders that were to govern the conduct of the security forces through the Anfal campaign and beyond. These orders were based on the simple axiom on which the regime now operated: in the 'prohibited' rural areas,all resident Kurds were coterminous with the peshmerga insurgents, and they would be dealt with accordingly.  The first of al-Majid's directives bans all human existence in the prohibited areas, to be applied through a shoot-to-kill policy. The second, numbered SF/4008, dated June 20, 1987, modifies and expands upon these orders. It constitutes a bald incitement to mass murder, spelled out in the most chilling detail. In clause 4, army commanders are ordered 'to carry out random bombardments, using artillery, helicopters and aircraft, at all times of the day or night, in order to kill the largest number of persons present in these prohibited zones.' In clause 5, al-Majid orders that, 'All persons captured in those villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them, of which we should be duly notified.'  Even as this legal and bureaucratic structure was being set in place, the Iraqi regime became the first in history to attack its own civilian population with chemical weapons. On April 15, 1987, Iraqi aircraft dropped poison gas on the KDP headquarters at Zewa Shkan, close to the Turkish border in Dohuk governorate, and the PUK headquarters in the twin villages of Sergalou and Bergalou, in the governorate of Suleimaniyeh. The following afternoon, they dropped chemicals on the undefended civilian villages of Sheikh Wasan and Balisan, killing well over a hundred people, most of them women and children. Scores of other victims of the attack were abducted from their hospital beds in the city of Erbil, where they had been taken for treatment of their burns and blindness. They have never been seen again. These incidents were the first of at least forty documented chemical attacks on Kurdish targets over the succeeding eighteen months. They were also the first sign of the regime's new readiness to kill large numbers of Kurdish women and children indiscriminately.  Within a week of the mid-April chemical weapons attacks, al-Majid's forces were ready to embark upon what he described as a three-stage program of village clearances or collectivization. The first ran from April 21 to May 20; the second from May 21 to June 20. More than 700 villages were burned and bulldozed, most of them along the main highways in government-controlled areas. The third phase of the operation, however, was suspended; with Iraqi forces still committed to the war front, the resources required for such a huge operation were notavailable. But the goals of the third stage would eventually be accomplished by Anfal.  In terms of defining the target group for destruction, no single administrative step was more important to the Iraqi regime than the national census of October 17, 1987. Now that the springtime village clearances had created a virtual buffer strip between the government and the peshmerga-controlled zones, the Ba'ath Party offered the inhabitants of the prohibited areas an ultimatum: either they could 'return to the national ranks'--in other words, abandon their homes and livelihoods and accept compulsory relocation in a squalid camp under the eye of the security forces; or they could lose their Iraqi citizenship and be regarded as military deserters. The second option was tantamount to a death sentence, since the census legislation made those who refused to be counted subject to an August 1987 decree of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council, imposing the death penalty on deserters.  In the period leading up to the census, al-Majid refined the target group further. He ordered his intelligence officials to prepare detailed case-by-case dossiers of 'saboteurs'' families who were still living in the government-controlled areas. When these dossiers were complete, countless women, children and elderly people were forcibly transferred to the rural areas to share the fate of their peshmerga relatives. This case-by-case, family-by-family sifting of the population was to become a characteristic feature of the decisions made during the Anfal period about who should live and who should die.  Last, but not without significance, the census gave those who registered only two alternatives when it came to declaring their nationality. One could either be Arab or Kurdish--a stipulation that was to have the direst consequences for other minority groups, such as the Yezidis, Assyrians and Chaldean Christians who continued to live in the Kurdish areas.5  * * * The Anfal campaign began four months after the census, with a massive military assault on the PUK headquarters at Sergalou-Bergalou on the night of February 23, 1988. Anfal would have eight stages in all, seven of them directed at areas under the control of the PUK. The KDP-controlled areas in the northwest of Iraqi Kurdistan, which the regime regarded as a lesser threat, were the target of the Final Anfal operation in late August and early September, 1988.  The Iraqi authorities did nothing to hide the campaign from public view. On the contrary, as each phase of the operation triumphed, its successes were trumpeted with the same propaganda fanfare that attended the victorious battles in the Iran-Iraq War. Even today, Anfal is celebrated in the official Iraqi media. The fifth anniversary in 1993 of the fall of Sergalou and Bergalou on March 19, 1988 was the subject of banner headlines.  Iraqi troops tore through rural Kurdistan with the motion of a gigantic windshield wiper, sweeping first clockwise, then counterclockwise, through one after another of the 'prohibited areas.' The First Anfal, centered on the siege of the PUK headquarters, took more than three weeks. Subsequent phases of the campaign were generally shorter, with a brief pause between each as army units moved on to the next target. The Second Anfal, in the Qara Dagh region, lasted from March 22 to April 1, 1988; the Third, covering the hilly plain known as Germian, took from April 7 to April 20; the Fourth, in the valley of the Lesser Zab river, was the shortest of all, lasting only from May 3 to May 8.  Only in the Fifth Anfal, which began on May 15 in the mountainous region northeast of Erbil, did the troops have any real difficulty in meeting their objectives. Encountering fierce resistance in difficult terrain from the last of the PUK peshmerga, the regime called a temporary halt to the offensive on June 7. On orders from the Office of the Presidency (indicating the personal supervisory role that Saddam Hussein himself played in Anfal), the operation was renewed twice in July and August, with these actions denominated Anfal VI and Anfal VII. Eventually, on August 26, the last PUK-controlled area was declared 'cleansed of saboteurs.'  By this time, Iran had accepted Iraq's terms for a ceasefire to end the war, freeing up large numbers of Iraqi troops to carry the Anfal operation into the Badinan area of northern Iraqi Kurdistan. The Final Anfal began at first light on August 25, and was over in a matter of days. On September 6, 1988, the Iraqi regime made its de facto declaration of victory by announcing a general amnesty for all Kurds. (Ali Hassan al-Majid later told aides that he had opposed the amnesty, but had gone along with it as a loyal party man.)  Each stage of Anfal followed roughly the same pattern. It characteristically began with chemical attacks from the air on both civilian and peshmerga targets, accompanied by a military blitz against PUK or KDP military bases and fortified positions. The deadly cocktail of mustard and nerve gases was much more lethal against civilians than against the peshmerga, some of whom had acquired gas masks and other rudimentary defenses. In the village of Sayw Senan (Second Anfal), more than eighty civilians died; in Goktapa (Fourth Anfal), the death toll was more than 150; in Wara (Fifth Anfal) it was thirty-seven. In the largest chemical attack of all, the March 16 bombing of the Kurdish town of Halabja, between 3,200 and 5,000 residents died. As a city, Halabja was not technically part of Anfal--the raid was carried out in reprisal for its capture by peshmerga supported by Iranian Revolutionary Guards--but it was very much part of the Kurdish genocide.  After the initial assault, ground troops and jahsh enveloped the target area from all sides, destroying all human habitation in their path, looting household possessions and farm animals and setting fire to homes, before calling in demolition crews to finish the job. As the destruction proceeded, so did Hilberg's phase of the 'concentration' or 'seizure' of the target group. Convoys of army trucks stood by to transport the villagers to nearby holding centers and transit camps, while the jahsh combed the hillsides to track down anyone who had escaped. (Some members of the militia, an asset of dubious reliability to the regime, also saved thousands of lives by spiriting people away to safety or helping them across army lines.) Secret police combed the towns, cities and complexes to hunt down Anfal fugitives, and in several cases lured them out of hiding with false offers of amnesty and a 'return to the national ranks'--a promise that now concealed a more sinister meaning.  * * * To this point, Anfal had many of the characteristics of a counterinsurgency campaign, albeit an unusually savage one. And captured Iraqi documents suggest that during the initial combat phase, counterinsurgency goals were uppermost in the minds of the troops and their commanding officers. To be sure, Iraq--like any other sovereign nation--had legitimate interests in combating insurgency. But the fact that Anfal was, by the narrowest definition, a counterinsurgency, does nothing to diminish the fact that it was also an act of genocide. There isnothing mutually exclusive about counterinsurgency and genocide. Indeed, one may be the instrument used to consummate the other. Article I of the Genocide Convention affirms that 'genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law.' Summarily executing noncombatant or captured members of an ethnical-national group as such is not a legitimate wartime or counterinsurgency measure, regardless of the nature of the conflict.  In addition to this argument of principle, many features of Anfal far transcend the realm of counterinsurgency. These include, first of all, the simple facts of what happened after the military goals of the operation had been accomplished:  · the mass murder and disappearance of many tens of thousands of non-combatants--50,000 by the most conservative estimate, and possibly twice that number;  · the use of chemical weapons against non-combatants in dozens of locations, killing thousands and terrifying many more into abandoning their homes;  · the near-total destruction of family and community assets and infrastructure, including the entire agricultural mainstay of the rural Kurdish economy;  · the literal abandonment, in punishing conditions, of thousands of women, children and elderly people, resulting in the deaths of many hundreds. Those who survived did so largely due to the clandestine help of nearby Kurdish townspeople.  Second, there is the matter of how Anfal was organized as a bureaucratic enterprise. Viewed as a counterinsurgency, each episode of Anfal had a distinct beginning and an end, and its conduct was in the hands of the regular army and the jahsh militia. But these agencies were quickly phased out of the picture, and the captured civilians were transferred to an entirely separate bureaucracy for processing and final disposal. Separate institutions were involved--such as Amn, Istikhbarat, the Popular Army (a type of home guard) and the Ba'ath Party itself. And the infrastructure of prison camps and death convoys was physicallyremote from the combat theater, lying well outside the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. Tellingly, the killings were not in any sense concurrent with the counterinsurgency: the detainees were murdered several days or even weeks after the armed forces had secured their goals. Finally, there is the question of intent, which goes to the heart of the notion of genocide. Documentary materials captured from the Iraqi intelligence agencies demonstrate with great clarity that the mass killings, disappearances and forced relocations associated with Anfal and the other anti-Kurdish campaigns of 1987-1989 were planned in coherent fashion. While power over these campaigns was highly centralized, their success depended on the orchestration of the efforts of a large number of agencies and institutions at the local, regional and national level, from the Office of the Presidency of the Republic on down to the lowliest jahsh unit.  The official at the center of this great bureaucratic web, of course, was Ali Hassan al-Majid, and in him the question of intent is apparent on a second, extremely important level. A number of audiotapes were made of meetings between al-Majid and his aides from 1987 to 1989. These tapes were examined by four independent experts, to establish their authenticity and to confirm that the principal speaker was al-Majid. Al-Majid was known to have a distinctive, high-pitched voice and the regional accent of his Tikrit district origins; both these features were recognized without hesitation by those Iraqis consulted by Middle East Watch. As a public figure who frequently appears on radio and television in Iraq6, his voice is well known to many Iraqis. One Iraqi consulted on this subject pointed out that the principal speaker on the many hours of recordings in Middle East Watch's possession spoke with authority and used obscene language. In contrast, he said: 'Others in those meetings were courteous and respectful with fearful tones, especially when they addressed al-Majid himself.' Al-Majid, two experts noted, was often referred to by his familiar nickname, 'Abu Hassan.'  The tapes contain evidence of a bitter racial animus against the Kurds on the part of the man who, above any other, plotted their destruction. 'Why should I let them live there like donkeys who don't know anything?' al-Majid asks in one meeting. 'What did we ever getfrom them?' On another occasion, speaking in the same vein: 'I said probably we will find some good ones among [the Kurds]...but we didn't, never.' And elsewhere, 'I will smash their heads. These kind of dogs, we will crush their heads.' And again, 'Take good care of them? No, I will bury them with bulldozers.'  Loyalty to the regime offered no protection from al-Majid's campaigns. Nor did membership in the pro-government jahsh. Al-Majid even boasted of threatening militia leaders with chemical weapons if they refused to evacuate their villages. Ethnicity and physical location were all that mattered, and these factors became coterminous when the mass killings took place in 1988.  The 1987 village clearances were wholly directed at government-controlled areas, and thus had nothing whatever to do with counterinsurgency. If the former residents of these areas refused to accept government-assigned housing in a mujamma'a, and took refuge instead in a peshmerga-controlled area -- as many did -- they too were liable to be killed during Anfal. The same applied to other smaller minorities. In the October 1987 census, many Assyrian and Chaldean Christians -- an Aramaic-speaking people of ancient origin -- refused the government's demands that they designate themselves either as Arabs or Kurds. Those who declined to be Arabs were automatically treated as Kurds. And, during the Final Anfal in Dohuk governorate, where most Christians were concentrated, they were in fact dealt with by the regime even more severely than their Kurdish neighbors. Those few Turkomans, a Turkic-speaking minority, who fought with the Kurdish peshmerga were not spared, because they too were deemed to have become Kurds.  Almost continuously for the previous two decades, the Ba'ath-led government had engaged in a campaign of Arabization of Kurdish regions. The armed resistance this inspired was Kurdish in character and composition. In 1988, the rebels and all those deemed to be sympathizers were therefore treated as Kurds who had to be wiped out, once and for all. Whether they were combatants or not was immaterial; as far as the government was concerned they were all 'bad Kurds', who had not come over to the side of the government.  * * * To pursue Hilberg's paradigm a little further, once the concentration and seizure was complete, the annihilation could begin. The target group had already been defined with care. Now came the definition of the second, concentric circle within the group: those who were actually to be killed.  At one level, this was a straightforward matter. Under the terms of al-Majid's June 1987 directives, death was the automatic penalty for any male of an age to bear arms who was found in an Anfal area.7 At the same time, no one was supposed to go before an Anfal firing squad without first having his or her case individually examined. There is a great deal of documentary evidence to support this view, beginning with a presidential order of October 15, 1987--two days before the census--that 'the names of persons who are to be subjected to a general/blanket judgment must not be listed collectively. Rather, refer to them or treat them in your correspondence on an individual basis.' The effects of this order are reflected in the lists that the Army and Amn compiled of Kurds arrested during Anfal, which note each person's name, sex, age, place of residence and place of capture.  The processing of the detainees took place in a network of camps and prisons. The first temporary holding centers were in operation, under the control of military intelligence as early as March 15, 1988; by about the end of that month, the mass disappearances had begun in earnest, peaking in mid-April and early May. Most of the detainees went to a place called Topzawa, a Popular Army camp on the outskirts of Kirkuk--the city where Ali Hassan al-Majid had his headquarters. Some went to the Popular Army barracks in Tikrit. Women and children were trucked on from Topzawa to a separate camp in the town of Dibs; between 6,000 and 8,000 elderly detainees were taken to the abandoned prison of Nugra Salman in the southern desert, where hundreds of them died of neglect, starvation and disease. Badinan prisoners from the Final Anfal went through a separate but parallel system, with most being detained in the huge army fort at Dohuk and the women and children being transferred later to a prison camp in Salamiyeh on the Tigris River close to Mosul.  The majority of the women, children and elderly people were released from the camps after the September 6 amnesty. But none of theAnfal men were released. Middle East Watch's presumption, based on the testimony of a number of survivors from the Third and bloodiest Anfal, is that they went in large groups before firing squads and were interred secretly outside the Kurdish areas. During the Final Anfal in Badinan, in at least two cases groups of men were executed on the spot after capture by military officers carrying out instructions from their commanders.  The locations of at least three mass gravesites have been pinpointed through the testimony of survivors. One is near the north bank of the Euphrates River, close to the town of Ramadi and adjacent to a complex housing Iranian Kurds forcibly displaced in the early stages of the Iran-Iraq War. Another is in the vicinity of the archaeological site of Al-Hadhar (Hatra), south of Mosul. A third is in the desert outside the town of Samawah. At least two other mass graves are believed to exist on Hamrin Mountain, one between Kirkuk and Tikrit and the other west of Tuz Khurmatu.8  While the camp system is evocative of one dimension of the Nazi genocide, the range of execution methods described by Kurdish survivors is uncannily reminiscent of another--the activities of the Einsatzkommandos, or mobile killing units, in the Nazi-occupied lands of Eastern Europe. Each of the standard operating techniques used by the Einsatzkommandos is documented in the Kurdish case. Some groups of prisoners were lined up, shot from the front and dragged into pre-dug mass graves; others were shoved roughly into trenches and machinegunned where they stood; others were made to lie down in pairs, sardine-style, next to mounds of fresh corpses, before being killed; others were tied together, made to stand on the lip of the pit, and shot in the back so that they would fall forward into it--a method that was presumably more efficient from the point of view of the killers. Bulldozers then pushed earth or sand loosely over the heaps of corpses. Some of the gravesites contained dozens of separate pits, and obviously contained the bodies of thousands of victims. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the executioners were uniformed members of the Ba'ath Party, or perhaps of Iraq's General Security Directorate (Amn).  By the most conservative estimates, 50,000 rural Kurds died during Anfal. While males from approximately fourteen to fifty wereroutinely killed en masse, a number of questions surround the selection criteria that were used to order the murder of younger children and entire families.  Many thousands of women and children perished, but subject to extreme regional variations, with most being residents of two distinct 'clusters' that were affected by the Third and Fourth Anfals. Abuses by zealous local field commanders may explain why women and children were rounded up, rather than being allowed to slip away. But they cannot adequately explain the later patterns of disappearance, since the detainees were promptly transferred alive out of army custody, segregated from their husbands and fathers in processing centers elsewhere, and then killed in cold blood after a period in detention. The place of surrender, more than place of residence, seems to have been one consideration in deciding who lived and who died. Amn documents indicate that another factor may have been whether the troops encountered armed resistance in a given area--which indeed was the case in most, but not all, of the areas marked by the killing of women and children. A third criterion may have been the perceived 'political stance' of detainees, although it is hard to see how this could have been applied to children.  Whatever the precise reasons, it is clear from captured Iraqi documents that the intelligence agencies scrutinized at least some cases individually, and even appealed to the highest authority if they were in doubt about the fate of a particular individual. This suggests that the annihilation process was governed, at least in principle, by rigid bureaucratic norms. But all the evidence suggests that the purpose of these norms was not to rule on a particular person's guilt or innocence of specific charges, but merely to establish whether an individual belonged to the target group that was to be 'Anfalized,' i.e. Kurds in areas outside government control. At the same time, survivor testimony repeatedly indicates that the rulebook was only adhered to casually in practice. The physical segregation of detainees from Anfal areas by age and sex, as well as the selection of those to be exterminated, was a crude affair, conducted without any meaningful prior process of interrogation or evaluation.  * * * Although Anfal as a military campaign ended with the general amnesty of September 6, 1988, its logic did not. Those who were released from prisons such as Nugra Salman, Dibs and Salamiyeh, as well as those who returned from exile under the amnesty, were relocated to complexes with no compensation and no means of support. Civilians who tried to help them were hunted down by Amn. The mujamma'at that awaited the survivors of the Final Anfal in Badinan were places of residence in name alone; the Anfalakan were merely dumped on the barren earth of the Erbil plain with no infrastructure other than a perimeter fence and military guard towers. Here, hundreds perished from disease, exposure, hunger or malnutrition, and the after-effects of exposure to chemical weapons. Several hundreds more--non-Muslim Yezidis, Assyrians and Chaldeans, including many women and children--were abducted from the camps and disappeared, collateral victims of the Kurdish genocide. Their particular crime was to have remained in the prohibited majority Kurdish areas after community leaders declined to accept the regime's classification of them as Arabs in the 1987 census.  The regime had no intention of allowing the amnestied Kurds to exercise their full civil rights as Iraqi citizens. They were to be deprived of political rights and employment opportunities until Amn certified their loyalty to the regime. They were to sign written pledges that they would remain in the mujamma'at to which they had been assigned--on pain of death. They were to understand that the prohibited areas remained off limits and were often sown with landmines to discourage resettlement; directive SF/4008, and in particular clause 5, with its order to kill all adult males, would remain in force and would be carried out to the letter.  Arrests and executions continued, some of the latter even involving prisoners who were alive, in detention, at the time of the amnesty. Middle East Watch has documented three cases of mass executions in late 1988; in one of them, 180 people were put to death. Documents from one local branch of Amn list another eighty-seven executions in the first eight months of 1989, one of them a man accused of 'teaching the Kurdish language in Latin script.'  The few hundred Kurdish villages that had come through Anfal unscathed as a result of their pro-government sympathies had no guarantees of lasting survival, and dozens more were burned and bulldozed in late 1988 and 1989. Army engineers even destroyed the large Kurdish town of Qala Dizeh (population 70,000) and declared itsenvirons a 'prohibited area,' removing the last significant population center close to the Iranian border.  Killing, torture and scorched-earth policies continued, in other words, to be a matter of daily routine in Iraqi Kurdistan, as they always had been under the rule of the Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party. But the Kurdish problem, in al-Majid's words, had been solved; the 'saboteurs' had been slaughtered. Since 1975, some 4,000 Kurdish villages had been destroyed; at least 50,000 rural Kurds had died in Anfal alone, and very possibly twice that number; half of Iraq's productive farmland had been laid waste. All told, the total number of Kurds killed over the decade since the Barzani men were taken from their homes is well into six figures.  By April 23, 1989, the Ba'ath Party felt that it had accomplished its goals, for on that date it revoked the special powers that had been granted to Ali Hassan al-Majid two years earlier. At a ceremony to greet his successor, the supreme commander of Anfal made it clear that 'the exceptional situation is over.'  To use the language of the Genocide Convention, the regime's aim had been to destroy the group (Iraqi Kurds) in part, and it had done so. Intent and act had been combined, resulting in the consummated crime of genocide. And with this, Ali Hassan al-Majid was free to move on to other tasks demanding his special talents--first as governor of occupied Kuwait and, then, in 1993, as Iraq's Minister of Defense.  ______   1 A derisive Kurdish term for the National Defense Battalions, the word jahsh means 'donkey foals.'  2 'Saboteurs' is the term commonly applied by the Iraqi regime to the Kurdish peshmerga guerrillas and their civilian sympathizers.  3 As defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (hereinafter the Genocide Convention), 78 UNTS 277, approved by GA Res. 2670 on December 9, 1948, entered into force January 12, 1951.  4 Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1985 student edition), p.267.  5 While the Yezidis, a syncretic religious sect, are ethnic Kurds, the Assyrians and Chaldeans are a distinct ancient people in their own right.  6 Al-Majid has served variously over the past five years as Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau, Interior Minister, Governor of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait in 1990 and, as Defense Minister.  7 Rural Kurdish men carry personal weapons as matter of tradition, regardless of their politics.  8 Other mass graves have been found elsewhere in Kurdish-controlled territory, containing the remains of Amn executions before, during and after the Anfal period.     1   Ba'athis and Kurds   'Black are his colors, black pavilion,  His spear, his shield, his horse, his armor, plumes,  And jetty feathers menace death and hell--  Without respect of sex, degree or age,  He razeth all his foes with fire and sword.  -- Christopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great, Part One (IV,i)       'Each era is different. Everything changes. But Saddam Hussein is worse than Tamburlaine of 600 years ago.'  -- Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari of Goktapa, site of chemical weapons attack, May 3, 1988.          It is a land of spring flowers and waving fields of wheat, of rushing streams and sudden perilous gorges, of hidden caves and barren rock faces. Above all, it is a land where the rhythm of life is defined by the relationship between the people and the mountains. One range after another, the peaks stretch in all directions as far as the eye can travel, the highest of them capped year-round by snow. 'Level the mounts,' so the old saying goes, 'and in a day the Kurds would be no more.'  The Kurds have inhabited these mountains for thousands of years. 'The territories designated since the 12th Century as Kurdistan,' says one scholar, 'were inhabited since the most distant antiquity and constitute one of the very first settlements of human civilization. Jarmo, in the valley of Chamchamal, at present in Iraq, is the most ancient village of the Middle East. Here, four thousand years before our era, man already cultivated diverse grains (wheat, barley, lentils, peas, etc.), plucked fruits (olives, almonds, pistachios, figs), raised sheep and goats.'1  Yet for all their antiquity, the Kurds have never been able to form an independent political entity of their own in modern times. Fromthe 16th to the early 20th centuries, their territories formed part of the Ottoman and Persian empires. With the collapse of the Ottoman empire after World War One, the Kurds were to be granted their independence under the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres. But that promise evaporated as the nationalist movement of Kamal Ataturk seized control of the Kurdish lands in eastern Turkey and the Kurds saw their mountain homeland divided once more among four newly created states--Turkey, Syria, Iraq and the Soviet Union, and one ancient land--Iran, or Persia as it was then known.  Each of these states has balked at assimilating its Kurdish minority, and each of the Kurdish groups has rebelled against the authority of its new central government. Of these traditions of rebellion, none has been more persistent than that of the Iraqi Kurds.2 There are larger Kurdish populations--some ten to fifteen million Kurds live in Turkey and seven million in Iran, compared to just four million in Iraq.3 Yet a number of factors set the Iraqi Kurds apart from their neighbors. They were proportionately the largest ethnic minority in the region, at least until the 1980s, accounting for fully 23 percent of the total Iraqi population4. The proportion of Kurds in Turkey may now be fractionally higher, but this is not a consequence of normal demographic trends. The relative decline of the Iraqi Kurdish population is a political matter. Hundreds of thousands have fled into exile; tens of thousands more have been killed, above all in 1988, in the course of the six-and-a-half month long campaign of extermination known as Anfal.  The Iraqi Kurds have also been the victims of an accident of geography, for vast oil reserves were discovered in the 20th century on the fringes of their ancestral lands. The Kurds have repeatedly challenged the government in Baghdad for control of these areas--especially the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk. And it is this contest for natural resources and power, as much as any consideration of ideology or deep-rooted ethnic animus, which underlies the brutal treatment of the Kurds by the ruling Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party.  Since the 1920s, the Iraqi Kurds have staged one revolt after another against the central authorities. Most of these rebellions had their nerve center in a remote area of northeastern Iraq called the Barzan valley, which lies close to the Iranian and Turkish borders on the banks of the Greater Zab river. From the early 1940s to the mid-1970s, the idea of Kurdish rebellion was inseparable from the name of a charismatic tribal leader from that valley, Mullah Mustafa Barzani.  Barzani's only real success came in 1946, when Iraqi and Iranian Kurds joined forces to found the Mahabad Republic. But the Mahabad experiment lasted only a year before it was crushed, and Barzani fled to the Soviet Union with several thousand fighters in a celebrated 'long march.'5 After the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958, the Kurds encountered a familiar pattern under each of the regimes that followed: first a period of negotiations that invariably failed to satisfy Kurdish demands for autonomy, and then, when the talks broke down, renewed outbreaks of violence.6 Rural villages were bombed and burned andKurdish fighters hunted down relentlessly. The name that they adopted expressed accurately the condition of their existence. They called themselves peshmerga--'those who face death.'  * * *   In 1988, during the final six months of Iraq's eight-year long war with Iran, something terrible occurred in the mountains of northern Iraq. At least metaphorically, the regime of Saddam Hussein did 'level the mounts,' in the sense of razing thousands of villages, destroying the traditional rural economy and infrastructure of Iraqi Kurdistan and killing many tens of thousands of its inhabitants.  The outside world has long known of two isolated episodes of abuse of the Iraqi Kurds in 1988. In both instances, it was the proximity of the victims to international borders, and thus to the foreign media, that accounted for the news leaking out. In the first, the March 16 poison gas attack on the Kurdish city of Halabja, near the border with Iran, the Iranian authorities made it their business to show off the site to the international press within a few days of the bombing. Even so, the illusion has long persisted, fostered initially by reports from the U.S. intelligence community, which 'tilted' strongly toward Baghdad during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, that both sides were responsible for the chemical attack on Halabja.7 This is false: The testimony of survivorsestablishes beyond reasonable doubt that Halabja was an Iraqi action, launched in response to the brief capture of the city by Iraqi peshmerga assisted by Iranian Revolutionary Guards (pasdaran). The thousands who died, virtually all of them civilians, were victims of the Iraqi regime.8  The second well-publicized event was the mass exodus of at least 65,000, and perhaps as many as 80,000, Iraqi Kurdish refugees from the northern mountains of the Badinan area into the Turkish borderlands, during the final days of August.9 The reason for their flight was later conclusively demonstrated to have been a further series of chemical weapons attacks by the Iraqi armed forces.10 Since World War One, the use of poison gas in warfare has been regarded as a special kind of abomination. Chemical weapons were banned by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, to which Iraq is a party, and many countries subsequently destroyedtheir stockpiles. While Iraq, and to a lesser extent Iran, had broken the battlefield taboo on many occasions since 1983, the Halabja and Badinan attacks marked a new level of inhumanity, as the first documented instances of a government employing chemical weapons against its own civilian population.  Yet Halabja and Badinan are merely two pieces in a much larger jigsaw puzzle, and they formed part of a concerted offensive against the Kurds that lasted from March 1987 until May 1989. In the judgment of Middle East Watch, the Iraqi campaign against the Kurds during that period amounted to genocide, under the terms of the Genocide Convention.11  Middle East Watch has reached this conclusion after over eighteen months of research. Our methodology has had three distinct and complementary elements. The first was an extensive series of field interviews with Kurdish survivors. Between April and September 1992, Middle East Watch researchers interviewed in depth some 300 people in Iraqi Kurdistan and spoke to hundreds of others about their experiences. Most had been directly affected by the violence; many had lost members of their immediate families. In March and April 1993, an additional fifty interviews sought to deal with the questions that remained unanswered.  The second dimension of Middle East Watch's Iraqi Kurdistan project was a series of forensic examinations of mass gravesites, under the supervision of the distinguished forensic anthropologist Dr. Clyde Collins Snow. Dr. Snow's first preliminary trip, to the Erbil and Suleimaniyeh areas, was in December 1991. On two subsequent visits, Dr. Snow's team exhumed a number of graves, in particular a site containing the bodies of twenty-six men and teenage boys executed by the Iraqi Army in lateAugust 1988 on the outskirts of the village of Koreme, in the Badinan area.12  The third, and most ambitious, strand in our research has been the study of captured Iraqi intelligence archives. During 1991 and early 1992, through a variety of sources, Middle East Watch had assembled a modest file of official Iraqi documents that described aspects of the regime's policy toward the Kurds. For the most part, these had been seized from Iraqi government buildings during the aborted Kurdish uprising of March 1991. Then, in May 1992, Middle East Watch secured permission to examine and analyse 847 boxes of Iraqi government materials that had been captured during the intifada by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two main parties in Iraqi Kurdistan. Through an arrangement between the PUK and the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the documents became Congressional Records of the Committee.13 Analysis of the documents began on October 22, 1992, and in many cases it has been possible to match documentary evidence about specific villages or campaigns with testimonial material from the same locations.  As Raul Hilberg notes in his history of the Holocaust, 'There are not many ways in which a modern society can, in short order, kill a large number of people living in its midst. This is an efficiency problem of the greatest dimensions...'14 The trove of captured documents demonstrates in astonishing breadth and detail how the Iraqi state bureaucracy organized the Kurdish genocide. Some of these documents were seized during the uprising by the citizens of the Kurdish city of Suleimaniyeh and later stuffed haphazardly into stout plastic flour sacks. Others, piled first into tea boxes and then wrapped in sacks stamped'PUK Shaqlawa,' were taken from the offices of Iraq's General Security Directorate (Mudiriyat al-Amn al-Ameh), commonly known as Amn, in Erbil and the northern resort town of Shaqlawa.15 The contents of these boxes are often charred as a result of the March 1991 fighting, in which many government buildings were torched. Some are wrinkled, partly shredded and almost illegible after prolonged exposure to moisture. The documents are crammed into bulging ring-back letter files or bound together loosely with staples, string, laces or pins. Hand-written ledgers are covered with flowered wallpaper, kept clean with sheets of transparent plastic. Sometimes their Arabic titles are lettered in ornate psychedelic script with a variety of colored felt-tip pens, by bored or whimsical clerks with the right security clearance. One police binder is neatly bound in Christmas wrapping paper from Great Britain that shows a red-breasted robin singing cheerfully among sprigs of holly.  Between them, the documents show in compelling detail how the Iraqi security bureaucracy tackled the 'efficiency problem' of razing thousands of Kurdish villages from the map and murdering tens of thousands of their inhabitants. There are smoking guns here, in the form of signed government decrees ordering summary mass execution. Yet equally telling in their own way are the thousands upon thousands of pages of field intelligence notes, scribbled annotations of telephone conversations, minutes of meetings, arrest warrants, deportation orders, notes on the burning of a particular village, casualty lists from chemical attacks, lists of the family members of 'saboteurs,' phone surveillance logs, food ration restrictions, interrogation statements and salutes to victorious military units. Between them these are, so to speak, the innumerable tiny pixels that together make up the picture of the Kurdish genocide.  * * *   For those who survived the slaughter, the experience can be summed up in a single word: al-Anfal. The word is religious in origin; it is the name of the eighth sura, or chapter, of the Koran. According to the Iraqi writer Kanan Makiya, whose May 1992 article in Harper's Magazine was the first written journalistic treatment of the Anfal campaign, the eighth sura is 'the seventy-five-verse revelation that came to the Prophet Mohammed in the wake of the first great battle of the new Muslim faith at Badr (A.D. 624). It was in the village of Badr, located in what is now the Saudi province of Hejaz, that a group of Muslims numbering 319 routed nearly 1,000 Meccan unbelievers. The battle was seen by the first Muslims as vindication of their new faith; the victory, the result of a direct intervention by God.'16  In this sura, the Arabic word 'al-Anfal' means 'spoils,' as in the spoils of battle. It begins, 'They will question thee concerning the spoils. Say: 'The spoils belong to God and the Messenger; so fear you God, and set things right between you, and obey you God and his Messenger, if you are believers.'  The sura continues with the revelation of God's will to the angels:  'I am with you; so confirm the believers. I shall cast into the unbelievers' hearts terror; so smite above the necks, and smite every finger of them!' That, because they had made a breach with God and with His Messenger; and whosoever makes a breach with God and with His Messenger, surely God is terrible in His retribution. That for you; therefore taste it; and that the chastisement of the Fire is for the unbelievers.'17  Although Saddam Hussein has often chosen in recent years to wrap his campaigns in religious language and iconography, Ba'athist Iraq is a militantly secular state. The victims of the 1988 Anfal campaign, the Kurds of northern Iraq, are for the most part Sunni Muslims. During Anfal, every mosque in the Kurdish villages that were targeted for destruction was flattened by the Iraqi Army Corps of Engineers, using bulldozers and dynamite.  * * *   Kurdish Autonomy and Arabization   Yet for all its horror, it would be wrong to say that Anfal was entirely unprecedented, for terrible atrocities had been visited on the Kurds by the Ba'ath Party on many occasions in the past. Ironically, when Iraqi Kurds are asked if they can recall a period of stable peace, they speak first of the early years of the second Ba'ath Party regime, after the coup of July 1968. The radical pan-Arabist ideology on which the party had been founded was hostile to the non-Arab Kurds, who are culturally and linguistically related to the Persians. Yet the new Iraqi regime made a priority of achieving a durable settlement with the Kurds.  The Ba'ath was not lacking in pragmatism. The party was weak when it came to office, and it had no desire to contend with a troublesome insurgency. Pan-Arabist rhetoric was therefore played down after 1968, in favor of a new effort to forge a single unified Iraqi identity, one in which the Kurds would be accepted as partners--if not exactly equal ones. The modern nation-state of Iraq had been an artificial creation of the League of Nations in the 1920s, when the former southern vilayat of the Ottoman Empire were subdivided into mandate territories administered by Britain and France. Iraq's boundaries, incorporating the vilayet of Mosul, reflected British interest in achieving control over that region's known oil resources.  It was oil that proved to be the Achilles' heel of the autonomy package that was offered to the Kurds by Saddam Hussein, the Revolutionary Command Council member in charge of Kurdish affairs. On paper the Manifesto of March 11, 1970 was promising. It recognized the legitimacy of Kurdish nationalism and guaranteed Kurdish participation in government and Kurdish language-teaching in schools.18 But it reserved judgment on the territorial extent of 'Kurdistan,' pending a new census. Such a census would surely have shown a solid Kurdish majority in the city of Kirkuk and the surrounding oilfields, as well as in the secondary oil-bearing area of Khanaqin, south of the city of Suleimaniyeh. But no census was scheduled until 1977, by which time the autonomy deal was dead.19  As before, Kurdish ideals were hostage to larger political forces. In April 1972, the Ba'ath regime signed a 15-year friendship treaty with the Soviet Union; two months later it nationalized the Iraq Petroleum Company; and with the October 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Iraq's oil revenues soared tenfold.20 In June of that year, with Ba'ath-Kurdish relations already souring, the legendary guerrilla leader Mullah Mustafa Barzani laid formal claim to the Kirkuk oilfields. Baghdad interpreted this as a virtual declaration of war, and in March 1974 unilaterally decreed an autonomy statute.  The new statute was a far cry from the 1970 Manifesto, and its definition of the Kurdish autonomous area explicitly excluded the oil-rich areas of Kirkuk, Khanaqin and Jabal Sinjar. In tandem with the 1970-1974 autonomy process, the Iraqi regime carried out a comprehensive administrative reform, in which the country's sixteen provinces, or governorates, were renamed and in some cases had their boundaries altered. The old province of Kirkuk was split up into two. The area around the city itself was now to be named al-Ta'mim ('nationalization') and its boundaries redrawn to give an Arab majority. A new, smaller province, to be known as Salah al Din, included the city of Tikrit and the nearby village of al-Ouja, Saddam Hussein's birthplace. Clearly the parallel between Saddam and the legendary mediaeval warrior, known in the West as Saladin, was anything but accidental (although, ironically, Saladin was himself a Kurd, and like many of his kin had initially hired himself out to Arab armies).21 Baghdad gave the Kurds two weeks to accept its terms22; Barzani responded with a renewal of his dormant armed revolt.  In the belief that they have no lasting friends, Kurdish leaders have long made alliances of convenience with outsiders, and Barzani assumed that foreign support would allow his fight to prosper. Horrified by Iraq's new alignment with the Soviet Union, the Israeli government and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency trained senior KDP leaders and kept Barzani generously supplied with intelligence and arms, including heavy weaponry. The Shah of Iran, meanwhile, provided an indispensable rearguard territory as well as logistical support.  With this help, the peshmerga resisted the Iraqi assault for a year, although more than a hundred thousand refugees fled to Iran and the Kurdish towns of Zakho and Qala Dizeh were heavily damaged by aerial bombing.  But Barzani grossly overestimated the commitment of outsiders to his cause. In March 1975, the Shah and Saddam Hussein signed the Algiers Agreement, which surprised most observers by putting an end--atleast for the time being--to the long-standing quarrel between the two countries. Iraq granted Iran shared access to the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway; as a quid pro quo, the Shah abruptly withdrew his military and logistical support from the Iraqi Kurds. Within a week, Barzani's revolt had collapsed. Its leader, a broken man, was soon dead. 'Covert action should not be confused with missionary work,' was Dr. Henry Kissinger's famous remark on the affair.  In the eyes of the Ba'ath Party, Barzani's collaboration with Iran, the United States and Israel marked the Kurds down as Fifth Columnists. 'Those who have sold themselves to the foreigner will not escape punishment,' said Saddam Hussein, who at this point was deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, and the official responsible for internal security matters.23 That attitude colored Ba'ath dealings with the Kurds for the next two decades. Its culmination was the campaign known as Anfal.  * * *   With the collapse of the Barzani Revolution, as Kurds call it, the Iraqi regime shifted its anti-Kurdish activities into a higher gear. The traditional concerns of counterinsurgency planners now gave way to the more ambitious goal of physically redrawing the map of northern Iraq. This meant removing rebellious Kurds from their ancestral lands and resettling them in new areas under the strict military control of the Baghdad authorities.  In 1975 the Iraqi government embarked on a sweeping campaign to 'Arabize' the areas that had been excluded from Kurdistan under theoffer of autonomy--an effort that had first begun in 1963. Hundreds of Kurdish villages were destroyed during the mid-1970s in the northern governorates of Nineveh and Dohuk, and about 150 more in the governorate of Diyala, the southernmost spur of Iraqi Kurdistan, where there were also significant oil deposits.24 Restrictions were imposed, and maintained over the years that followed, on the employment and residence of Kurds in the Kirkuk area.25 Arab tribespeople from southern Iraq were enticed to move to the north with government benefits and offers of housing. Uprooted Kurdish farmers were sent to new homes in rudimentary government-controlled camps along the main highways.  Some were forcibly relocated to the flat and desolate landscapes of southern Iraq, including thousands of refugees from the Barzani tribal areas who returned from Iran in late 1975 under a general amnesty. Once moved, they had no hope of resuming their traditional farming activities: 'The houses that the government had allocated for the Kurds in those areas were about one kilometer away from each other,' recalled one returning refugee. 'They told me I should stay there and become a farmer, but we could not farm there: it was all desert.'26 In November 1975, an Iraqi official acknowledged that some 50,000 Kurds had beendeported to the southern districts of Nasiriya and Diwaniya, although the true figure was almost certainly higher.27  This reference to 'houses' is a little misleading, for the new quarters were primitive in the extreme. The relocated Kurds were simply driven south in convoys of trucks, dumped in the middle of nowhere and left to their own resources. 'This is to prevent you from going to Mustafa [Barzani] or Iran,' one villager remembers being told by a soldier.28 Many people died of heat and starvation; the remainder survived at first in 'shades'--crude shelters fashioned from branches and thatch, or rugs strung on a framework of poles. In time they managed to build mud houses with the money that the men earned as day-laborers in the nearest town.  In 1977-1978, under the terms of the 1975 Algiers Agreement, Iraq began to clear a cordon sanitaire along its northern borders. At first, a former Iraqi military officer told Middle East Watch, this no-man's land extended five kilometers (3.1 miles) into Iraq; later, it was extended to ten kilometers, then to fifteen, and finally to thirty (18.6 miles). The governorate of Suleimaniyeh, which shares a long mountainous border with Iran, was the worst affected, and estimates of the number of villages destroyed during this first wave of border clearances run as high as 500, the great majority of them in Sulemaniyeh.29 Again, official Iraqi statements convey some minimal sense of the numbers involved: the Ba'ath Party newspaper Al-Thawra admitted that 28,000 families (as many as 200,000 people) had been deported from the border zone in just twomonths during the summer of 1978.30 Deportees say that they were given five days to gather up their possessions and leave their homes; when that deadline had expired the army demolition crews moved in.  This was no haphazard operation. A new bureaucratic infrastructure was set up in August 1979 to handle these forced mass relocations, in the form of the Revolutionary Command Council's Committee for Northern Affairs, headed by Saddam Hussein. (Reportedly, a 'Special Investigation Committee' (Hay'at al-tahqiq al-khaseh) was also set up at this time, charged with identifying potential peshmerga and authorized to order the death penalty without consulting Baghdad.)31  Saddam Hussein's committee now began systematically to redraw the map of Iraqi Kurdistan, and the border clearances of the late 1970's marked the first large-scale introduction of the mujamma'a, or 'complex' system of Kurdish resettlement camps.32 The mujamma'at (plural) were crudely built collective villages, located near large towns or along the main highways in areas controlled by the Iraqi Army. Sometimes the Kurds received some nominal compensation for their confiscated lands, although the amounts offered were usually derisory. They could also apply for loans from the government's Real Estate Bank in order to build a home in the complexes; but they were forbidden to return to their ancestral lands.  After the start of the war with Iran, which began with the Iraqi invasion of September 22, 1980, Baghdad's campaign against the Kurdsfaltered. Army garrisons in Iraqi Kurdistan were progressively abandoned or reduced, their troops transferred to the Iranian front; into the vacuum moved the resurgent peshmerga. Villages in the north began to offer refuge to large numbers of Kurdish draft dodgers and army deserters. Increasing stretches of the countryside effectively became liberated territory.  In these early years of the Iran-Iraq war, it was the KDP--now commanded by Mullah Mustafa Barzani's sons, the half-brothers Mas'oud and Idris--that was the main object of Baghdad's attention.33 Since 1975, the KDP had been based at Karaj, outside Teheran. The Iraqi regime's hostility only grew when it learned that the Kurdish group was now allying itself quite as readily with Iran's new clerical rulers as it had with the Shah.  The villagers who had been removed from the Barzan valley in 1975 spent nearly five years in their new quarters in the southern governorate of Diwaniya. But in 1980 army trucks, East German-supplied IFAs, rolled up outside their desert encampment and told them they were to be relocated again. For most, the new destination was Qushtapa, a new resettlement complex a half-hour drive to the south of the Kurdish city of Erbil. Some were taken to Baharka, north of Erbil, and others to the mujamma'at of Diyana and Harir, some way to the northeast. There was no permanent housing in these complexes, nothing but tents, but the villagers were relieved at first to be breathing the air of Kurdistan once more.  But in the last week of July 1983, the residents of Qushtapa became aware of unusual military movements. Fighter planes screamed overhead, making for the Iranian border. Troop convoys could be seen on the paved highway that bisected the camp, headed in the same direction. Listening to Teheran radio, the Barzanis learned that the strategic border garrison town of Haj Omran had fallen to an Iranian assault. What they did not know at first was that the KDP had effectively acted as scouts and guides for the Iranian forces.  The reprisals began in the early hours of July 30. 'We were all asleep when the soldiers surrounded the complex at 3:00 a.m.,' said oneBarzani woman who was living in Qushtapa at the time.34 'Then, before dawn, as people were getting dressed and getting ready to go to work, all the soldiers at once charged through the complex. They captured the men walking on the street and even took an old man who was mentally deranged and was usually left tied up. They took the religious man who went to the mosque to call for prayers. They were breaking down doors and entering the houses searching for our men. They looked inside the chicken coops, water tanks, refrigerators, everywhere, and took all the men over the age of thirteen. The women cried and clutched the Koran and begged the soldiers not to take their men away.'  'I tried to hold on to my youngest son, who was small and very sick,' added another of the 'Barzani widows,' as the women are now known. 'I pleaded with them, 'You took the other three, please let me have this one.' They just told me, 'If you say anything else, we'll shoot you,' and then hit me in the chest with a rifle butt. They took the boy. He was in the fifth grade.'  Between five and eight thousand Barzani men from Qushtapa and other other camps were loaded into large buses and driven off toward the south. They have never been seen again, and to this day the widows show visitors to the Qushtapa camp framed photographs of their husbands, sons and brothers, begging for information about their fate.35 For almost a year after the raid the Qushtapa camp was sealed. Electrical power was cut off; the women were not allowed to leave, even to shop, and townspeople of Erbil smuggled in food secretly at night. 'Now that your men are gone, why don't you come and stay with us?' one woman who remained behind recalls being taunted by Amn agents.  In a 1983 speech, President Saddam Hussein left little doubt what had happened to the Barzanis. 'They betrayed the country and they betrayed the covenant,' he said, 'and we meted out a stern punishment to them and they went to hell.'36 The seizure and presumed mass killing of the Barzani men was the direct precursor of what would be repeated on a much larger scale five years later, during the campaign known as Anfal.  * * *   Exploiting Kurdish Divisions   The Barzani half-brothers' KDP, however, was not the only source of peshmerga resistance to the regime. Divisions within the Kurdish movement had deep roots, which were as much historical and tribal as doctrinal. The Barzan Valley's claim to leadership of the movement had long been couched in religious and mystical terms. This uncompromising attitude made the Barzanis bitter enemies among a number of neighboring tribes such as the Surchi and Zebari.37 Mullah Mustafa Barzani's charismatic, not to say high-handed, style of leadership had alsoproduced a steady stream of rivals within his party. And after the debacle of 1975 these conflicts erupted into the open.  The power of the Barzani half-brothers--or the 'offspring of treason,' as the Ba'ath regime now took to calling them--was quickly challenged by Jalal Talabani. Formerly a lieutenant of the elder Barzani and a member of the KDP politburo, Talabani had long been critical of the 'feudal' style of the tribally-based organization and now proposed to supplant it with a secular leftist movement rooted among urban intellectuals. In 1976, Talabani made the break formal with the creation of his Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), and two years later open warfare broke out between the two rival groups. The bitter schism would plague them until the final two years of the Iran-Iraq War.  Other groups complicated the picture still further. In 1979 another of Mullah Mustafa's former senior aides, Mahmoud Osman, joined forces with a breakaway group of peshmerga from the PUK to form the Kurdistan Socialist Party. In the same year, the Iraqi Communist Party also took up arms against the Baghdad regime and set up its headquarters to the north of the city of Suleimaniyeh, in the same valley as the PUK.38 A clear geographical division quickly emerged. The KDP remained the dominant force in the mountain areas of Badinan in the far north, while the PUK held sway to the east and south of the Greater Zab river. (Other, smaller groups operated locally under suffrance of the two main peshmerga organizations.) This divide was linguistic as well as cultural: to the north and west of the river, the principal Kurdish dialect is Kurmanji; to the south, it is Sorani.39  Hampered in its ability to solve the Kurdish problem by force, the Iraqi regime leavened its repressive policies with a calculated attempt at divide-and-rule. This in turn had two dimensions: first, to play on theacrimonious divisions between the leading Kurdish parties; and second, to recruit as many Kurds as possible into tribally-based pro-government paramilitary groups.  Baghdad's best opportunity to drive a wedge between the KDP and the PUK came with what was, on the face of it, a menacing development in the Iran-Iraq War. Talabani had bitterly opposed the Barzanis' decision to facilitate Iran's Haj Omran offensive in July 1983, and in September of that year he grew even more alarmed when further Iranian attacks penetrated the border area around the town of Penjwin--uncomfortably close to the PUK's own strongholds in Suleimaniyeh governorate.40 Talabani vowed that his troops would fight side-by-side with the Ba'ath Party to expel the invaders from Iraqi soil. Seizing the opportunity, Saddam Hussein offered the PUK leader a renewed commitment to Kurdish autonomy, hoping to win his seasoned guerrilla army permanently over to Baghdad's side. Almost a decade later, one member of the PUK team that negotiated with the Iraqi regime recalled clearly the words of Tariq Aziz, a member of the Revolutionary Command Council and later Iraq's Foreign Minister. 'He told us, 'If you help us, we will never forget it. But if you oppose us, we will never forget it. And after the [Iran-Iraq] war is over, we will destroy you and all your villages completely.'41 It was not an empty threat.  The negotiations dragged on inconclusively for more than a year before they finally broke down in January 1985. While there were a number of reasons for the collapse of the talks, none was more important than Talabani's reported reiteration of Mullah Mustafa Barzani's unacceptable demand that the Kirkuk and Khanaqin regions, with their oilfields, be considered part of Kurdistan.42 But although Saddam Hussein failed to cement a lasting alliance with Talabani, he could takesatisfaction in the fact that the PUK-KDP rift was now deeper and more bitter than ever.  Tribal loyalties in much of Iraqi Kurdistan have loosened somewhat during the modern era. Where they remain strong, however, they have offered fertile soil for successive regimes to recruit militias in the drive to undermine Kurdish solidarity. Known officially under Saddam Hussein as the Command of the National Defense Battalions (Qiyadet Jahafel al-Difa' al-Watani), these paramilitary bands have long been derided by other Kurds as jahsh, or 'donkey foals.'43  The jahsh have existed in some form since at least the early 1960s, but their role has been expanded several times since. In principle, each tribal group was supposed to produce its contingent of jahsh as a demonstration of loyalty to the regime; each unit's commander enjoyed the title of mustashar (consultant or advisor). If tribal leaders did not agree to cooperate in forming jahsh units, then Amn threats would often be persuasive.44  The ordinary jahsh came under the operational command of military intelligence (Istikhbarat) in the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War and during the Anfal campaign. But there were also two élite forces of pro-government Kurds. The Quwat al-Taware' (Emergency Forces) carried out intelligence and counter-terrorism activities in the cities under the control of the Ba'ath Party. The Mafarez Khaseh, meanwhile, or 'special units' of Kurdish agents, were formed by hard-core collaborators and were an official part of Amn. All of these groups were heavily indoctrinated by the regime against their fellow Kurds. In an introductory seminar, one former jahsh commander recalled, militaryintelligence officers told the assembled mustashars that the peshmerga were neither Kurds nor Iraqis; under Islamic law, they were 'infidels and shall be treated as such.'45  The duties of the rank-and-file jahsh were broadly akin to those of similar militias in other parts of the world.46 Poorly equipped with light weapons, they maintained road blocks, patrolled the countryside, did advance scouting work for the regular army, searched villages for army deserters and draft dodgers, and handed over suspected peshmerga to the authorities. For obvious reasons the regime never fully trusted the jahsh's loyalties. Even though jahsh members were largely recruited from complexes, towns and villages under government control (Zakho, for instance, is said to have had as many as 5,000 jahsh), their units were frequently rotated to prevent local sympathies from developing. Mustashars knew that the regime was wary of any illicit contacts they might have with peshmerga commanders in the vicinity, and Amn files that Middle East Watch has examined contain extensive surveillance dossiers on jahsh leaders.  The early years of the war against Iran made it apparent that Kurdish conscripts made reluctant soldiers, and on a number of occasions groups of Kurds were released from military service and inducted into the jahsh instead. If an adult male Kurd had connections to his local mustashar, he would pull every possible string to evade military service and serve in the jahsh instead.  Many of the mustashars found their new role appealing. Some were nobodies, elevated by the government to positions of real power. Others were traditional tribal leaders who discovered that the rich opportunities for graft as a mustashar more than made up for their declining influence among the local Kurds. In addition to his fixedsalary, the mustashar was entitled to a small monthly cash payment for each man nominally under his command. Yet it was a common practice for many of these men--even the vast majority in some cases--to avoid active duty. On paper, the regime had, at the peak of their numbers, 250,000 Kurdish foot-soldiers at its disposal; in practice, only a fraction of that number genuinely bore arms. In exchange for a signed jahsh ID that would protect them from military service, these Kurdish men were quite content for the mustashar to pocket their salary as well as his own. At 85 dinars ($255) a month for each paper soldier, it was easy for a canny mustashar to amass a fortune. The brothers Omar and Hussein Surchi, for example, parlayed their earnings into a contracting and construction business that made them the richest men in Kurdistan.  While the government was prepared to tolerate practices like this for the sake of a mustashar's fealty, it acted ruthlessly toward any show of independence. Several witnesses told Middle East Watch the story of a mustashar named Ja'far Mustafa, who was executed in 1986 for insubordination. The man was reportedly a fervent partisan of the Ba'ath regime, but would only agree to head up a jahsh contingent on condition that he be allowed to remain in his home area in the northern mountains of Badinan. In 1986 the order came through for Ja'far Mustafa's transfer, and he refused to move. During the standoff his defiance of Saddam Hussein was the talk of Iraqi Kurdistan. But after a week he was executed in Baghdad, and his body then returned from the capital to his home, near the northern town of Mangesh, where it was publicly hanged for the second time. The two villages that he owned--Besifki and Dergijneek--were burned to the ground some time later.47  * * *   1985-1987: Open War   After the collapse of the Ba'ath-PUK talks in January 1985, the Iraqi regime found its control of Kurdistan eroding once more. The warwith Iran, calculated to bring a swift victory, was dragging on interminably with heavy casualties on both sides. Although the government had built a chain of small forts and larger fortresses throughout the Kurdish countryside, it was simply not feasible to keep large numbers of troops pinned down there. Several dozen Kurdish settlements, mainly in PUK-controlled areas near the Iranian border, were burned in piecemeal fashion in the mid-1980s, and their inhabitants resettled in mujamma'at. But hundreds of other ancient villages--perhaps as many as 2,000--tried to integrate the counterinsurgency war into the rhythms of their daily lives. In the process, their communities were transformed.  The biggest threat to civilian morale came from shelling. The Iraqi Army had divided up Kurdistan according to a grid pattern and placed heavy artillery at regular intervals with a range of up to twenty-five miles. The guns pounded around the clock, and it was impossible to predict which targets would be hit on any given day. Routine farm work became a potentially lethal game of chance; sleep patterns were disrupted; the constant uncertainty shredded everyone's nerves.  Helicopters regularly dropped troops and jahsh into the villages to search for draft dodgers, deserters and suspected peshmerga. A steady stream of captured Kurds were taken away and executed. Others died in the frequent attacks by Soviet-supplied government MIGs and Sukhoi fighter-bombers.  Since the time of the first Ba'ath regime in 1963, Kurdish villagers had learned to protect themselves against aerial attack by building primitive shelters outside their homes. Now the pace of shelter construction accelerated, their design becoming more elaborate. Many were virtual underground rooms, high enough to stand up in, covered with wooden planks or corrugated iron sheeting and layers of dirt, stones and branches. The more sophisticated had twisting entrance tunnels to protect the occupants against shrapnel and blast. Many whole villages moved into nearby caves and rock overhangs and came to lead a virtual nocturnal existence, emerging to tend their animals and fields only when darkness fell.  Hamlets of three or four houses and small towns of three or four thousand people practiced an enforced self-sufficiency. Many villages elected their own five-person councils (majlis al-sha'ab in Arabic, or anjuman in Kurdish). As the government withdrew its rudimentary public services from rural areas, peshmerga teachers arrived to staff theabandoned schools and itinerant peshmerga paramedics tried to make up for the clinics that had been closed. In most cases, the villages had never had electricity or piped water, and in this sense the regime's ability to inflict additional hardship was limited. As before, the Kurds drew their water from rivers, springs and underground streams,48 and the more prosperous took their electrical power from private generators. Commerce depended on smuggling. Knowing every goat-path in the surrounding hills, the villagers learned to evade the government road-blocks that tried to enforce a blockade on foodstuffs to peshmerga-controlled areas. Only women were allowed past these checkpoints. Sometimes younger boys could slip through with the help of a bribe, but it was a risky business, and some were arrested and disappeared on suspicion of aiding the peshmerga.  By now the practical distinction between peshmerga and ordinary civilians had blurred. In principle at least, active peshmerga received a salary from the organization to which they belonged and served duty rotas of 15-20 days at a time, with equal spells at home to work their lands. But many of the military-age men (and even some of the women) were also armed and organized into a so-called Civil Defense Force (hezi bergri milli or hezi peshjiri), whose main task was to defend their villages and hold off the army until peshmerga reinforcements could arrive. Light arms could be bought without much difficulty from the jahsh and it was common for households to have more than one weapon.  The peshmerga, meanwhile, tried to keep the regime off balance with their mixture of fixed and mobile forces. Hundreds of the smallest guerrilla units, or mafrazeh, roamed the countryside. In mountainous areas, a mafrazeh could be as small as five men; in the villages, fifteen was the minimum number needed for successful defense. Above the mafrazeh was the kird, and above the kird the teep, which the Kurds thought of as their equivalent of an army division.49  By the beginning of 1987, the only parts of Iraqi Kurdistan over which Baghdad exercised effective control were the cities, larger towns,complexes and paved highways. Authority over the rural areas was roughly divided between the KDP in the north and the PUK in the south. While the regime had long vilified the KDP as the 'offspring of treason,' it now saw ominous signs that the PUK, too, was acting as the military and political surrogate of a foreign power with which Iraq was at war. Talabani's group would henceforth be known officially as Umala Iran--'agents of Iran'--a term reportedly coined by Saddam Hussein himself.50  Insulting though it may have been, the phrase was grounded in fact, for since the latter part of 1986 Iranian-PUK collaboration had been a reality. While the KDP had long enjoyed access to Iranian sanctuaries, the PUK now felt that it had no alternative but to do likewise. In landlocked Kurdistan, the struggle could never succeed without help from a friendly neighbor. 'There was no way for food and supplies to reach us, no help for our wounded, no roads out of the territory that we had liberated,' claimed Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin, who was deputy commander of the PUK at the time. 'Iran was our window to the world.'  In October 1986, the PUK and the Iranian government concluded a sweeping accord on economic, political and military cooperation. Both parties agreed that they would press the fight against the Iraqi regime until Saddam Hussein was toppled, and both promised to make no unilateral deals with Baghdad.51 If either party faced a serious military threat, the other would open a second front to relieve the pressure; Iran agreed to provide the PUK with arms, financial support and medical aid, while foreswearing the right to impose an Islamic regime in Baghdad.52 The results of the accord were apparent almost at once,on October 10, when a group of Iranian Revolutionary Guards, or pasdaran accompanied by Kurdish peshmerga, struck at the Kirkuk oilfields, deep inside Iraqi territory. At the same time, to Baghdad's evident fury, the Iranians brokered a unity agreement between the PUK and the KDP, putting an end to their longstanding rivalry.  The Teheran accords brought a radical shift in the attitude of the Iraqi regime. Despite having the upper hand in the war against Iran, the security situation within its own borders had slipped badly. Since the resumption of the war with the PUK in 1985, Kurdish affairs had been overseen by Muhammad Hamza al-Zubeidi, head of the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath Party Organization. After a full-scale security review of the region, al-Zubeidi had reportedly been ordered to bring the situation under control within six months; when that period elapsed there was a six-month extension. But still the situation continued to deteriorate, and in early 1987 Baghdad decided on harsher measures. From now on, all those who still lived and farmed in the Kurdish mountains would be considered as active enemies of the state by virtue of nothing more than their ethnicity and their physical presence in their ancestral homeland.  ______   1 P.J.

For a general historical and cultural overview, see Mehrdad R. Izady, The Kurds: A Concise Handbook (Washington, D.C.: Crane Russak, 1992). A useful brief summary is David McDowall, 'The Kurdish question: a historical review,' in Philip G. Kreyenbroek and Stefan Sperl, eds., The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview (London and New York: Routledge, 1992), especially pp.24-30.  3 Izady, op cit, p.117, gives the following figures: Turkey 13.65 million, Iran 6.6 million, Iraq 4.4 million.  4 According to Izady, loc cit, Kurds made up fully 25 percent of the Iraqi population in 1980, compared to 21.3 percent in Turkey. By 1990, he estimated the figures were 23.5 percent and 24.1 percent respectively. Other estimates are much lower, putting the Kurds at only 16 or 17 percent of the Iraqi population.  5 The Kurds, however, unlike other national liberation movements, were never able to count on consistent Soviet support.  6 Since the revolution of July 14, 1958, there have been four regimes in Baghdad: the military government of Abd al-Karim Qasem and the 'Free Officers' (1958-1963); the first regime of the Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party (February-November 1963); the governments of the Arif brothers and Abd al-Rahman al-Bazzaz (1963-1968); and the second Ba'ath regime (1968 to the present). Saddam Hussein, one of the leaders of the July 1968 coup, has been President of Iraq since 1979. The best general work on the period is Marion Farouk-Sluglett and Peter Sluglett, Iraq Since 1958: From Revolution to Dictatorship (London: I.B. Tauris, 1990). Other useful studies include Phebe Marr, The Modern History of Iraq (Boulder: Westview Press, 1985) and CARDRI (Committee against Repression and for Democratic Rights in Iraq), Saddam's Iraq: Revolution or Reaction? (London: Zed Books, 1986).  7 Books on the Iran-Iraq War have routinely echoed the unsubstantiated report that both sides had used chemical weapons in Halabja. This notion originated in a study for the U.S. Army War College: Stephen C. Pelletiere, Douglas V. Johnson II and Leif R. Rosenberger, Iraqi Power and U.S. Security in the Middle East (Carlisle Barracks, PA: Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, 1990). It is repeated in a later book by Pelletiere, a former U.S. intelligence officer, The Iran-Iraq War: Chaos in a Vacuum (New York: Praeger, 1992). This strongly pro-Iraqi work comments, 'On May 23 (sic), in fighting over the town, gas was used by both sides. As a result scores (sic) of Iraqi Kurdish civilians were killed. It is now fairly certain that Iranian gas killed the Kurds.' (pp.136-137)  The supposed factual basis for this conclusion is that the Halabja victims had blue lips, characteristic of the effects of cyanide gas--which Iraq was not believed to possess. Cyanide gas, a metabolic poison, would indeed produce blue lips, but they are far from being a specific indicator of its use. Nerve agents, which are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that cause respiratory paralysis, would also turnvictims' lips blue. Middle East Watch interview with Dr. Howard Hu, Harvard School of Public Health, May 13, 1993. On Iraq's proven use of nerve agents against the Kurds during Anfal, see below footnote 10.  8 The Kurdish researcher Shorsh Resool, author of a study of the destruction of Kurdish villages (Destruction of a Nation, privately published, April, 1990), has assembled a list of the names of some 3,200 people who died in the Halabja attack. More impressionistic estimates have ranged as high as 7,000 (see below p.108).  9 The most frequently cited figure of 65,000 derives from Peter W. Galbraith and Christopher Van Hollen, Jr., 'Chemical Weapons Use in Kurdistan: Iraq's Final Offensive,' staff report to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, September 21, 1988. Tens of thousands also sought refuge in Iran, either fleeing directly from Iraq or else after passing through Turkey.  10 See Galbraith and Van Hollen, op cit. The February 1989 report by Physicians for Human Rights, 'Winds of Death: Iraq's Use of Poison Gas Against its Kurdish Population,' concluded that the injuries of refugees examined in Turkey were consistent with exposure to sulfur mustard (yperite). However, PHR noted, 'Eyewitness accounts of deaths beginning within minutes of exposure...cannot be explained by mustard gas alone.' The mystery was laid to rest in April 1993, when research on soil samples from the village of Birjinni, the site of a 1988 chemical weapons attack, showed the presence of trace elements of the nerve agent GB, also known as Sarin. See PHR-Human Rights Watch, 'Scientific First: Soil Samples Taken from Bomb Craters in Northern Iraq Reveal Nerve Gas--Even Four Years Later,' April 29, 1993.  11 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 78 UNTS 277, approved by General Assembly resolution 2670 on December 9, 1948, entered into force January 12, 1951. The convention defines genocide as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.' For a general discussion of the issues, as well as a series of case studies, see Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn, The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), and Helen Fein, ed., Genocide Watch (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992).  12 The findings of these missions are contained in two Middle East Watch-Physicians for Human Rights reports: Unquiet Graves: The Search for the Disappeared in Iraqi Kurdistan, February 1992, and The Anfal Campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan: The Destruction of Koreme, January 1993.  13 While the U.S. Defense Department has helped to expedite the research of the documents by assigning technical staff to the Iraqi Kurdistan project, Middle East Watch and the PUK jointly retain full control over the archive.  14 Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews (New York: Holmes and Meier, 1985), p.8.  15 Amn, whose technical functions are roughly equivalent to those of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, originated in the mid-1960s in a secret unit of the Ba'ath Party known as al-Jihaz al-Khas, the 'special apparatus.' Its code name was Jihaz Haneen, the 'instrument of yearning.' Saddam Hussein personally supervised the restructuring of the secret police that gave Amn its present name and functions in 1973. See Samir al-Khalil, op. cit., pp.5-6, 12-13. (Al-Khalil was the pseudonym formerly adopted by the Iraqi writer Kanan Makiya.)  16 The Iraqi regime may have selected this sura to legitimize its war on the Kurds by invoking a battle between two regular armies, and against a numerically stronger adversary. Makiya's article, 'The Anfal: Uncovering an Iraqi campaign to exterminate the Kurds,' (Harper's Magazine, May 1992, pp.53-61), is an extract from his book, Cruelty and Silence: War, Tyranny, Uprising and the Arab World (New York: Norton, 1993). Makiya's visit to northern Iraq also formed the basis for a report by the British film-maker Gwynne Roberts, 'Saddam's Killing Fields,' broadcast on BBC TV in January 1992 and PBS Frontline, March 31, 1992.  Two other overviews of the Anfal campaign have been published: Raymond Bonner, 'Always Remember,' (The New Yorker, September 28, 1992, pp.46-51, 54-58 and 63-65); and Judith Miller, 'Iraq Accused: A Case of Genocide,' (The New York Times Magazine), January 3, 1993, pp.12-17, 28, 31-33, 36). Miller's article deals in some detail with the progress of Middle East Watch's Iraqi Kurdistan documents project.  17 A.J. Arberry (trans.), The Koran Interpreted (New York: Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Co., 1955), p.198.  18 Indeed, the July 1970 Provisional Constitution stated that 'The People of Iraq is formed of two principal nationalities, the Arab nationality and the Kurdish nationality. This Constitution shall recognize the national rights of the Kurdish people and the legitimate rights of all minorities within the unity of Iraq.' The Iraqi government's view of the autonomy issue is set forth in Settlement of the Kurdish Problem in Iraq (Baghdad: Ath-Thawra Publications, c.1974).  19 Again, interestingly, it was a census that defined the geographical extent of the 1988 Anfal operation. See below pp. 84-90. See also the comments of Ali Hassan al-Majid on the size of the Arab population in Kurdistan, appendix A, p.353.  20 According to Farouk-Sluglett and Sluglett (op cit p.172), Iraqi oil revenues, a mere $575 million in 1972, rose to $1.84 billion in 1973 and $5.7 billion in 1974.  21 The Israeli scholar Amatzia Baram, in his fascinating book Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq, 1968-89 (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991), pp.61-62, shows how much of this administrative reform illustrated the party's desire to relate Iraq's modern history to the glories of antiquity. Most strikingly, the province of Diwaniya was renamed Qadissiya--after the decisive battle between the Arab and Persian armies in A.D. 635. The Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988, it should be noted, was officially referred to as 'Saddam's Qadissiyah.'  22 This was, as McDowall (op cit) puts it, 'autonomy by ultimatum.'  23 Speech of September 24, 1973, in Saddam Husain, On Current Events in Iraq (London: Longman, 1977), pp.17-18, cited in al-Khalil, Republic of Fear. There is also some evidence that the Ba'ath Party harbored a general racial hostility against the Kurds for their kinship with the Persians. According to al-Khalil, for example (op cit p.17), the Iraqi government publishing house Dar al-Hurriyya circulated a pamphlet in 1981 entitled Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews and Flies and written by Saddam Hussein's father-in-law, Khairallah Tulfah, a former governor of Baghdad. According to Tulfah, Persians are 'animals God created in the shape of humans'; Jews are a 'mixture of the dirt and leftovers of diverse peoples'; and flies are a trifling creation 'whom we do not understand God's purpose in creating.'  24 A helpful guide to the scale of these village clearances is Resool, Destruction of a Nation, op.cit. Resool's figures, which Middle East Watch regards as highly reliable, list 369 villages destroyed or depopulated in the northern part of Iraqi Kurdistan, and another 154 in Diyala governorate.  25 For example, a directive from the headquarters of the General Security Directorate (Amn), dated May 4, 1985 and coded K3/34478, expresses concerns about Kurdish migration to the city of Kirkuk. The document orders that no changes of residence in the governorate of Al-Ta'mim (Kirkuk) will be allowed 'until the Northern Affairs Committee [of the Revolutionary Command Council and security circles have given their opinion. This is in order to carry out a secret investigation of the person and the reasons for his taking up residence in the above-mentioned governorate.'  26 Middle East Watch interview, Qushtapa complex, May 3, 1992.  27 Reported in The Times (London), November 27, 1975, as cited in Martin van Bruinessen, 'The Kurds Between Iran and Iraq,' Middle East Report, July-August 1986, p.27.  28 Middle East Watch interview, Qushtapa complex, May 4, 1992.  29 Resool (op cit) gives the following figures: 336 villages destroyed in Suleimaniyeh (26 in 1977 and 310 in 1978); 120 in Erbil governorate (79 in 1977 and 41 in 1978); and the remainder scattered in the governorates of Dohuk and Diyala. Additional testimony gathered by Middle East Watch speaks of 124 villages destroyed around the town of Qala Dizeh; and of 260-265 villages destroyed in the entire governorate of Sulemainiyeh.  30 Al-Thawra, September 18, 1978, cited in Van Bruinessen, op cit p.24.  31 The Northern Affairs Committee is the source of numerous Iraqi government documents that Middle East Watch has examined. It is also referred to (as the 'Higher Committee for Northern Affairs') by al-Khalil, in Republic of Fear, p.24. The Kirkuk-based Special Investigations Committee, according to a former Iraqi military intelligence officer interviewed by Middle East Watch, consisted of four members--one each from the Ba'ath Party, the General Security Directorate (Amn), Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat) and the foreign intelligence organization (Mukhabarat).  32 Other resettlement camps--Urdugakan in Kurdish, or Mu'askarat in Arabic, had been built during the 1975 Arabization campaign to house newly arrived Sunni Arabs from the south. This was especially true of areas on the plain north of Dohuk that was formerly occupied by the Kurdish Sleivani tribe.  33 Idris died of a heart attack in 1987; Mas'oud Barzani remains the supreme leader of the KDP.  34 Middle East Watch interview, Qushtapa, May 4, 1992.  35 There is some evidence that the Barzani men were kept alive in captivity for at least a year before eventually being killed. One Mukhabarat file contains a sequence of thirty-nine presidential decrees issued in 1983, numbered 998 to 1036, listing individuals who have been sentenced to death in 'cases of a special nature.' Later correspondence is appended, and one handwritten comment asks 'Are any of the above-mentioned persons who have been sentenced to death in our custody?' The reply, also handwritten and dated April 9, 1985, says 'None of the above-mentioned persons who have been sentenced to death are in our custody, with the exception of the Barzani group who were living in our area prior to their detention.' [emphasis added]  According to a surviving Barzani tribesman interviewed by Middle East Watch in Salah al-Din on March 18, 1993, some of the Barzani women and children were again rounded up by government officials in 1986, trucked to the Turkish border and ordered to leave the country. After remaining on the border forsome time, they returned to Qushtapa and it appears that no further action was taken against them. A series of proposed measures against the surviving Barzanis, including stripping them of their Iraqi citizenship, are detailed in Istikhbarat correspondence from January 1986, reporting a ruling by the Northern Affairs Committee of the Revolutionary Command Council.

The picture was further complicated by the presence in these areas of a number of smaller groups, including Iranian organizations such as the KDP-Iran and Komala, who were conducting guerrilla war against the regime in Teheran from Iraqi soil.  39 Kurdish is a member of the Iranian language group, and has many dialects in addition to Sorani and Kurmanji. See Van Bruinessen, Agha, Shaikh and State, pp.21-22, citing D.N. MacKenzie, 'The Origins of Kurdish,' Transactions of the Philological Society, 1961, pp.68-86.  40 By now Iraq had used chemical weapons a number of times against Iranian troops, but it is probable that the Penjwin offensive marked their first use on Iraqi soil. See Anthony H. Cordesman and Abraham R. Wagner, The Lessons of Modern War, Volume II: The Iran-Iraq War (London and Boulder: Mansell-Westview, 1990), p.514, and generally pp.506-518.  41 Middle East Watch interview with Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin, Washington, D.C., May 2, 1993.  42 Marr, op cit, p.307.  43 The epithet is in such common everyday use that it has lost much of its pejorative force in the process. In the Kurmanji-speaking areas of the north, the Kurdish paramilitaries are also referred to as chatta--brigands or bandits.  44 One former mustashar described a 1987 conversation with the head of Amn in Suleimaniyeh, a colonel by the name of Khalaf. 'He told me that I must carry a gun for the government. He pressured me to join. He told me, 'You did not participate in the [Iran-Iraq] war; you must now become a mustashar.' He then told me, 'If you don't join, your identification card may be revoked.'' The later implications of this threat turned out to be very grave, since during Anfal the correct identification card could be a matter of life or death. Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 12, 1992.  45 In general, Islamic law does not apply in Iraq, a secular state--although some elements of Islamic law have been incorporated into areas such as family law. However, like the Anfal operation itself, this was an entirely characteristic attempt by the Ba'ath regime to legitimize its campaigns by wrapping them in the language of religion.  46 There are obvious parallels, for example, with Guatemala and Peru. See Americas Watch, Civil Patrols in Guatemala, (August 1986) and Peru Under Fire: Human Rights Since the Return of Democracy (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992).  47 According to a dossier of destroyed villages compiled by the Kurdistan Reconstruction and Development Society (KURDS), Upper and Lower Besifki were destroyed in 1987 and Dergijneek in 1988. Both were in the nahya of Al-Doski.  48 Some villages had developed relatively sophisticated water-supply and irrigation systems, channeling rivers to their homes through mud-brick covered trenches called karez.  49 Middle East Watch interview with Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin, Washington, D.C., May 2, 1993.  50 The tendency to describe the regime's opponents with insulting epithets was very common. One 17-year-old who was executed by the regime was described in an official Amn document, ordering the Suleimaniyeh morgue to dispose of his body, as a 'fire-worshipper'--a derogatory reference to the ancient Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism.  51 This was another in the long line of broken promises to the Kurds, who were certainly not consulted in July 1988 when Teheran accepted the UN ceasefire resolution in the middle of the Anfal campaign.  52 Middle East Watch interview with Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin, Washington D.C., May 2, 1993.  2   Prelude to Anfal 'I will confute those vile geographers  That make a triple region of the world,  Excluding regions which I mean to trace,  And with this pen reduce them to a map,  Calling the provinces, cities, and towns  After my name...  -- Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great, Part One (IV, iv)  All of the tendencies that had been implicit in earlier phases of Iraq's war on the Kurds reached their culmination in 1987-1988 with the endgame of the Iran-Iraq War and the campaign known as al-Anfal. In the captured Iraqi documents that are now being studied by Middle East Watch, the term crops up with great frequency: villages are 'purified' in the course of 'the Heroic Anfal Operation'; the reason for the flight of villagers into neighboring countries is given as 'Anfal'; an 'Anfal' oilfield is inaugurated and a special 'Anfal Section' of the Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party created in commemoration of the event; one of the government contractors hired to work on the drainage of Iraq's southern marshes is the 'Anfal Company.'1 It is evident from the documents, and from the supporting testimony of those who survived Anfal, that the resources of the Iraqi state were deployed and coordinated on a massive level to assure the success of the operation.  'Anfal' was the name given to a concerted series of military offensives, eight in all, conducted in six distinct geographical areas between late February and early September, 1988. Overall command of the operation was in the hands of the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath PartyOrganization, based in the city of Kirkuk and headed, after March 1987, by the 'Struggling Comrade' Ali Hassan al-Majid.2 Kurdish villagers who survived the events of 1988 routinely refer to al-Majid as 'Ali Anfal' or 'Ali Chemical.'  Al-Majid's appointment was highly significant for a number of reasons. Until 1987, military policy against the peshmerga had been set by the First and Fifth Corps of the Iraqi Army, based in Kirkuk and Erbil respectively. Now, however, the Ba'ath Party itself assumed direct charge of all aspects of policy toward the Kurds. Al-Majid's command also made the settlement of the Kurdish problem the concern of Iraq's innermost circle of power--the close network of family ties centered on the city of Tikrit and the personal patronage of President Saddam Hussein.  Saddam's father, whom he never knew, was a member of Tikrit's al-Majid family, and Ali Hassan al-Majid was the Iraqi president's cousin.3 Al-Majid, who was born in 1941, had humble origins, and first made his reputation in 1968--as a mere sergeant--as the bodyguard to Hammad Shihab al-Tikriti, commander of the Baghdad army garrison and one of the ringleaders of the Ba'ath coup in July of that year. Al-Majid rose quickly in the Tikrit circle and in 1979 played an important role in the purge of the party leadership. During the 1983-1985 negotiations between the regime and the PUK, Saddam Hussein appointed his cousin to head Amn.  Even by the standards of the Ba'ath security apparatus, al-Majid had a particular reputation for brutality. According to the (admittedly subjective) account of one former mustashar who had frequent dealings with him, 'He is more of a risk-taker than Saddam Hussein, and he has no respect for people. It was very difficult to work with him. He was stupid,and only carrying out Saddam Hussein's orders. In the past, he used to be a police sergeant; today he is Minister of Defense. Saddam Hussein, by contrast, is 'a snake with deadly poison.' He pretends to be weak, but at any chance he will use his poison....In tough cases, in which he needs people without a heart, he calls upon Ali Hassan al-Majid.'4  The main military thrust of Anfal was carried by regular troops of the the First and Fifth Corps, backed up by units from other corps as they became available from the Iranian front.5 The elite Republican Guards took part in the first phase of Anfal; other units which saw action included the Special Forces (Quwat al-Khaseh), commando forces (Maghawir) and Emergency Forces (Quwat al-Taware')--the Ba'ath Party-controlled urban counterterrorism squads. Finally, a wide range of support activities--entering population centers ahead of regular army units, burning and looting villages, tracking down fleeing villagers and organizing their surrender--were handled by the Kurdish paramilitary jahsh.  But the logic of Ali Hassan al-Majid's campaign against the Kurds went far beyond the six-month long military campaign. From a human-rights perspective, the machinery of genocide was set in motion by al-Majid's appointment in March 1987 and its wheels continued to turn until April 1989. Within weeks of al-Majid's arrival in Kirkuk, it was apparent that the Iraqi government had decided to settle its Kurdish problem onceand for all, and that the resources of the state would be used in a coordinated fashion to achieve this goal. A sustained pattern of decrees, directives and actions by the security forces leaves no doubt that the intent of the Iraqi government was to destroy definitively the armed organizations of the Kurdish resistance and to eradicate all remaining human settlements in areas that were disputed or under peshmerga control--with the exception of those inhabited by the minority of tribes whose loyalty to Baghdad was indisputable. If anything stood in the way of these goals in 1987, it was logistical shortcomings--above all, the fact that a large proportion of the troops and materiel that would be required for Anfal were still tied down on the Iranian war front.  * * *   It was Iraq that launched the war in 1980, and Iraq that maintained the initiative for much of the eight years that the conflict lasted.6 Nonetheless, the Iranians did succeed in putting Iraq on the defensive on a number of occasions. In July 1983, Iranian troops had seized the important border garrison town of Haj Omran, east of the town of Rawanduz. But the highpoint of the war from Iran's point of view was its Val Fajr 8 offensive of February 1986; this included a surprise attack that seized the marshy Fao peninsula, thereby blocking Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf.  Fresh from its success in Fao, which inflicted huge losses on the Iraqi Army (and reinforced the U.S. 'tilt' toward Baghdad), Iran reopened its second front in the north, in the rugged mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. For more than six years, the Iraqi regime had ceded de facto control overmuch of the rural north to the peshmerga; now foreign troops threatened to occupy more and more border territory, diverting much-needed forces from the southern front around Basra. As the October 1986 raid by Iranian pasdaran suggested to nervous Iraqi officials, the vital Kirkuk oilfields, almost a hundred miles from the border, were no longer immune.  There is debate among scholars as to the precise threat that Iraq faced from Iran at this late stage of the war. Certainly, Iran's huge Karbala 5 offensive against Basra's Fish Lake in January 1987 marked its final use of the 'human wave' tactic of hurling tens of thousands of troops--most of them poorly trained basij7--against fixed enemy targets. The resulting casualty levels were simply not sustainable, as Teheran now acknowledged. On February 12, Iranian troops returned to the Haj Omran area with a small offensive codenamed Fatah 4--although some believe that this was less a real attack than a diversionary action for propaganda purposes.8 But three weeks later, on March 4, a new and more alarming Iranian assault, this one codenamed Karbala 7, managed to penetrate eight miles into Iraqi territory east of Rawanduz with a joint military force which this time included peshmerga of the KDP and the PUK. The Iraqi regime was infuriated by these renewed signs of collusion, particularly since they now involved both rival Kurdish parties.9 On March 13, in a rare interview with a foreign reporter, Iraqi cabinet minister Hashim Hassan al-'Aqrawi commented, 'The Iranians are trying to use these people to carry out dirty missions, and since they know the geography of the area and its ins and outs, the Iranians use them merely as guides for the Khomeini Guards andthe Iranian forces.' The Kurds--or at least Talabani's PUK--even began to talk openly of dismembering the Iraqi state.10  On March 14 or 15, Saddam Hussein presided over a five-hour meeting of the Armed Forces General Command. Ali Hassan al-Majid was also reportedly in attendance. Any outsider's account of what took place in such a secretive meeting must be highly speculative, but according to at least two accounts, the Iraqi president told his senior officers that he feared a 'defeat by attrition.'11 On March 18, the Revolutionary Command Council and the Ba'ath Party's Regional Command jointly decided to appoint al-Majid, the president's cousin, as Secretary General of the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath Party Organization. His predecessors, Sa'adi Mahdi Saleh and Muhammad Hamza al-Zubeidi, had allowed the Kurdish problem to fester for too long; al-Majid would not repeat their mistakes.  In essence, the disagreements among scholars of the Iran-Iraq War are academic--at least as far as the Kurds are concerned. Saddam Hussein may indeed have foreseen a slow defeat as a result of Baghdad's existing policies; alternatively, he may have seen Iran's stalled Fish Lake offensive in January as a turning point in Iraq's favor, and an opportunity to press home his advantage. Either way, it is apparent that he decided that exceptional measures were necessary to settle the Kurdish problem, that troublesome sideshow of the Iran-Iraq conflict, once and for all.  Ali Hassan al-Majid's extraordinary new powers--equivalent in the Autonomous Region to those of the president himself--came into effect with decree no. 160 of the Revolutionary Command Council, dated March 29, 1987. Al-Majid was to 'represent the Regional Command of the Party and the Revolutionary Command Council in the execution of their policies for the whole of the Northern Region, including the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, for the purpose of protecting security and order, safeguarding stability, and applying autonomous rule in the region.' The decree went on to explain that, 'Comrade al-Majid's decisions shall be mandatory for allstate agencies, be they military, civilian and security.' His fiat would apply 'particularly in relation to matters that are the domain of the National Security Council and the Northern Affairs Committee.' A second order by Saddam Hussein, issued on April 20, 1987, gave al-Majid the additional authority to set the budget of the Northern Affairs Committee.  Al-Majid's 'decisions and directives' were to be obeyed without question by all intelligence agencies--including military intelligence (Istikhbarat)--and by all domestic security forces; by the Popular Army Command (Qiyadat al-Jaysh al-Sha'abi); and by all military commands in the northern region. Decree 160 and its riders leave no room for doubt: simply put, Ali Hassan al-Majid was to be the supreme commander, the overlord, of all aspects of Anfal.  * * *   Almost a year would pass before that campaign began. But within weeks of al-Majid's appointment, the logic of Anfal was fully apparent. Its legal framework was set in place; new standing orders were issued to the security forces; and a two-month wave of military attacks, village destruction and forced relocations was unleashed--a rough draft, as it were, of the larger campaign ahead. 'I gave myself two years to end the activity of the saboteurs,' al-Majid later told his aides.12 And with the first warm days of spring and the melting of the snow in the mountains, al-Majid embarked on his brutal three-stage process of 'village collectivization'--in other words, the wholesale destruction of hundreds of Kurdish farming villages and the relocation of their residents into mujamma'at.  Even his top military commanders were shocked by the brutality of what he had in mind. He later confided to aides:  When we made the decision to destroy and collectivize the villages and draw a dividing line between us and the saboteurs, the first one to express his doubts to me and before the President was [former Fifth Corps commander] Tali'a al-Durri. The first one who alarmed me was Tali'a al-Durri. To this day the impact of Tali'a is evident. He didn't destroy all the villages that I asked him to at thattime. And this is the longest-standing member of the Ba'ath Party. What about the other people then? How were we to convince them to solve the Kurdish problem and slaughter the saboteurs?13  The timetable for the three phases of al-Majid's campaign is clearly spelled out in a number of official documents, notably including a letter from the General Staff of the jahsh to the command of the Fifth Army Corps, dated April 13, 1987. This appears to be in response to a verbal order from the Fifth Corps commander concerning 'final obligations in winding up [illegible] procedures for the termination of sabotage in the Northern Region, [and] the manner and the priorities of implementing the evacuation and demolition of security-prohibited villages.' The first phase of the operation would begin on April 21 and end on May 20; the second would start immediately on May 21 and continue until June 20.14 Military and security maps were 'redlined,' with clear boundaries drawn to denote areas 'prohibited for security reasons.' Amn set up a special 'prohibited villages committee' to oversee the forbidden areas. Within the zones designated for phases one and two, the order was clear and explicit: 'All prohibited villages will be destroyed.'15  A former military intelligence (Istikhbarat) officer who later crossed over to the PUK told Middle East Watch of a meeting in Kirkuk that spring, attended by the governors of Erbil, Kirkuk, Dohuk and Suleimaniyeh, the commanders of the First and Fifth Army Corps, divisional military commanders and senior Ba'ath Party officials. Ali Hassan al-Majid, speaking in characteristically irascible tones, gave orders that 'no house was to be left standing' in the Kurdish villages on the Erbil plain. Only Arab villages would be spared.16 At a later meeting in Erbil,the witness heard al-Majid repeat these orders, and back them up with a personal threat: 'I will come and observe,' he said, 'and if I find any house intact, I will hold the section commander responsible.' After receiving these orders, the former Istikhbarat officer said, 'I got two IFAs [East German-built military trucks] full of explosives from a warehouse in Erbil. I commandeered 200 bulldozers from civilians of Erbil--by force, with no payment. We started destroying mud villages with bulldozers, and dynamiting the cement structures. We used military engineers for this.' The troops went in at dawn; wells were filled in and electricity supplies torn out, leaving only the poles standing. After the engineering work was completed, Istikhbarat would inspect the affected villages by helicopter. If any structure was found to be still standing, the sectional commander would be ordered to return and finish the job, and would risk disciplinary action. It was an extraordinarily thorough enterprise, and the evidence is visible all over Iraqi Kurdistan, with many villages not so much demolished as pulverized.  No farming of any sort was to continue in the destroyed areas. Government aircraft would conduct regular overflights to detect any unauthorized farming, and local security committees would be held responsible for any violations. Stringent restrictions were imposed on all grain sales in the Kurdish areas, as well as on agricultural trade across governorate boundaries.  Al-Majid also reportedly issued specific rules of engagement at the Erbil meeting. The army should only open fire in cases of active resistance, he ordered. But if resistance were encountered, the entire village population was to be killed in reprisal. In the event, there was no resistance, since the villages selected for the 1987 clearances were on or near the main roads and under government control. Only during Phase III of the campaign would the troops venture into peshmerga-held territory.  * * *   The Chemical Threshold   Even before the first stage of the village clearances got underway, the Iraqi regime had crossed a new barrier in its war against the Kurds. Throughout the early weeks of al-Majid's rule, the peshmerga--and in particular the PUK--kept up a steady rhythm of military actions. In earlyApril the PUK launched its most ambitious drive to date in the Jafati Valley, which runs southeast from Dukan Lake. The valley was home to the PUK's national headquarters, and thousands of peshmerga congregated there for the assault. In a matter of hours they had overrun dozens of small military posts and taken hundreds of prisoners.  The government's response was not long in coming. 'Our leadership received information that the Iraqis were going to use chemical weapons,' said a PUK peshmerga who fought in this campaign:  They issued instructions on what to do in case of a chemical attack. We were instructed to put wet cloths on our faces, to light fires, or to go to places located above the point of impact. In the beginning, the government used chemical artillery shells. This was in the Jafati and Shahrbazar valleys [on April 15], one or two nights after our victory. We didn't realize they were chemicals. The sound was not as loud as the ordinary shelling, and we smelled rotten apples and garlic.... Uncounted numbers of shells fell on us, but they had little effect.17  This was not the case the following day, however, in the villages of Balisan and Sheikh Wasan. These two settlements lie scarcely a mile and a half apart, in a steep-sided valley south of the town of Rawanduz. The Balisan valley was home to the PUK's third malband, or regional command.18 Yet few peshmerga were present on the afternoon of April 16, since most had been taking part in the military action in the Jafativalley, on the far side of Dukan Lake. Instead, their families would be made to suffer the repercussions.  Balisan itself was a sizeable village, which until April 1987 had some 250 households (about 1,750 people)19 of the Khoshnaw tribe, as well as four mosques, a primary school and an intermediate school. As the crow flies, it lay some twelve miles east of the town of Shaqlawa; Sheikh Wasan, a smaller settlement of about 150 houses, lay nestled in the hills a little way to the northeast. The valley was long-time peshmerga country; the Barzani movement had controlled it from 1961-74, and the PUK, through its third malband, since the outbreak of the war with Iran in 1980. Since about 1983, the Balisan Valley had been a 'prohibited area,' with government checkpoints attempting with only partial success to prevent the entry of foodstuffs and supplies. Food rations had been suspended, and government teachers withdrawn from the schools. Iraqi aircraft made frequent harassment attacks, to which the villagers responded by hiding away in deep, dark caves in the surrounding mountains. But ground troops had never managed to penetrate the valley.  In the drizzly late afternoon of April 16, the villagers had returned home from the fields and were preparing dinner when they heard the drone of aircraft approaching. Some stayed put in their houses; others made it as far as their air-raid shelters before the planes, a dozen of them, came in sight, wheeling low over the two villages to unload their bombs. There were a number of muffled explosions.  Until this moment no government had ever used chemical weapons against its own civilian population. But the plummeting enlistment rate among Iranian volunteers over the previous year, when poison gas was widely used on the battlefield, was vivid testimony to the Iraqi government of the power of this forbidden weapon to instil terror. More gruesome yet was the decision to record the event on videotape.  The Iraqi regime had long conducted its record-keeping in meticulous fashion. (Those in neighboring countries say, only half-jokingly, that the Iraqis are the 'Prussians of the Middle East.')20 From the grandest decree to the most trivial matter, all the business of the security forces was recorded in letters and telegrams, dated, numbered and rubber-stamped on receipt. Even when an original command carried a high security classification, abundant numbers of handwritten or typed copies were later prepared, to be handed down the chain of command and filed, the writers apparently confident that prying eyes would never see these secrets. In the mid-1980s, the Iraqi security services developed a fascination for video technology as a valuable new form of record-keeping. The actions of the security forces were now to be routinely documented on tape: village clearances, executions of captured peshmerga, even chemical weapons attacks on civilians.  The official videotape of the Balisan Valley bombing, reportedly made by a member of the jahsh, shows towering columns and broad, drifting clouds of white, gray and pinkish smoke. A cool evening breeze was blowing off the mountains, and it brought strange smells--pleasant ones at first, suggestive of roses and flowers, or, to others, apples and garlic. Other witnesses still say there was the less attractive odor of insecticide. But then, said one elderly woman from Balisan, 'It was all dark, covered with darkness, we could not see anything, and were not able to see each other. It was like fog. And then everyone became blind.' Some vomited. Faces turned black; people experienced painful swellings under the arms, and women under their breasts. Later, a yellow watery discharge would ooze from the eyes and nose. Many of those who survived suffered severe vision disturbances, or total blindness, for up to a month. In Sheikh Wasan, survivors watched as a woman staggered around blindly, clutching her dead child, and not realizing it was dead. Some villagers ran into the mountains and died there. Others, who had been closer to the place of impact of the bombs, died where they stood.21 One witness, a peshmerga, told MiddleEast Watch that a second attack followed an hour later, this one conducted by a fleet of helicopters.22  The few fighters who had been at home when the raid occurred were taken by the PUK for treatment in Iran, fearing that they would not survive a visit to an Iraqi hospital. (The presence of peshmerga in the village is, one should add, quite irrelevant from a legal point of view. By their very nature, chemical weapons make no distinction between civilian and military targets, and their use is outlawed under any circumstances.)23  The following morning, ground troops and jahsh entered Balisan, looted the villagers' deserted homes and razed them to the ground. The same day, or perhaps a day later--having presumably left sufficient time for the gas to dissipate--army engineers dynamited and bulldozed Sheikh Wasan. But the surviving inhabitants had already fled during the night of the attack. Some made their way to the city of Suleimaniyeh, and a few to Shaqlawa. But most headed southeast, to the town of Raniya, where there was a hospital. They were helped on their way by people from neighboring villages, some of which--including Barukawa, Beiro, Kaniberd and Tutma--had also suffered from the effects of the windborne gas.  The people of Beiro sent tractor-drawn carts to Sheikh Wasan, and ten of these vehicles, each carrying fifty or sixty people, left for Raniya. At the complex of Seruchawa, just outside the town, the tractors stopped to bury the bodies of fifty people who were already dead. The refugees who reached Raniya spent one night there. Local doctors washed their wounds and gave them eye-drops, but these did nothing to ease the effects of the gas on their vision. The refugees spent a restless night, and the hospital at Raniya was full of the sound of weeping.  The next morning, agents from Amn --and some witnesses say also from military intelligence (Istikhbarat)-- arrived at the hospital. They ordered everyone out of bed and into a number of waiting Nissan Coasters that were parked outside.24 These would take them to the city of Erbil for medical care, the villagers were told; however, they were warned later that day that they would only be given treatment if they told the doctors that their injuries were the result of an attack by Iranian airplanes.25  At about 9:00 that morning, exhausted and bedraggled people in Kurdish dress began to stream into the emergency room of the Republic Hospital in Erbil. One witness counted four packed coasters, each with twenty-one seats, and seven other vehicles--both cars and pickup trucks. Others placed the number of arrivals at perhaps 200, of all ages, men, women and children. They were all unarmed civilians. Four were dead on arrival. The survivors arriving from Ranya told the doctors that they had been attacked with chemical weapons. Despite their burns, their blindness and other, more superficial injuries, those who had survived the journey from the Balisan Valley were generally still able to walk, although some were unconscious.  Even with the assistance of doctors who rushed across from the nearby Maternity and Pediatric Hospital, the facilities were not sufficient to deal with such a large-scale emergency. There were far from enough beds to deal with so many victims; many of the patients were laid on the floors, and the occupants of three of the four coasters were obliged to wait in the parking lot while the preliminary triage was done and the first treatment carried out. On examination, the doctors found that the victims' eyes were dried out and glued shut. Having some rudimentary notion of how to treat chemical victims, they applied eye drops, washed their burns and administered injections of atropine, a powerful antidote to nerve agents.  The doctors had been at work on their patients for about an hour when the head of the local branch office of Amn arrived, an officer by the name of Hassan Naduri. The staff of the Erbil Republic Hospital, and especially the municipal morgue which was attached to it, had a great deal of prior and subsequent experience of Amn. The city housed not only themunicipal office of the secret police agency, but also Amn's headquarters for the Erbil governorate and its operational command for the entire 'autonomous region' of Iraqi Kurdistan. For several years the Republic Hospital morgue had received a steady flow of corpses from both Amn offices. Hospital records examined by Middle East Watch give details of approximately 500 bodies received from Amn between 1968-1987--although there is no reason to suppose that this was more than a very incomplete record.  These deaths were recorded in the form of letters of transmittal from Amn, and the agency's bureaucracy appears to have been scrupulously efficient. Two copies of each letter of transmittal were sent to the morgue; the doctor on duty was required to sign one of these and then return it to Amn. Hospital staff also kept a second, secret ledger of their own, entitled 'Record Book of Armed Dead People from Erbil.' This covered a three-year period beginning in June 1987; the final entry was dated June 25, 1990. The entries were cross-referenced to the number of the relevant Amn transmittal letter. In interviews with Middle East Watch, hospital staff also estimated that they made out some 300 death certificates, on orders from Amn, for named individuals whose bodies were never made available to them. This practice began in 1987.  There appears to have been no single standard procedure: Corpses arrived at the Erbil morgue in a number of different ways. Sometimes the staff would receive a telephone call from Amn, often in the middle of the night, telling them that they should prepare to receive the body or bodies of 'executed saboteurs' and ordering them to issue death certificates. Individual hospital porters were hand-picked for the task of handling the bodies, presumably because they enjoyed the trust of the Amn agents. On some occasions the corpses arrived in pickup trucks or station wagons, covered with blankets. At other times, hospital ambulances would be summoned to collect the bodies from the Amn headquarters in Einkawa, a Christian suburb of Erbil, or from a nearby military base. Although some showed signs of having been beaten to death, most appeared to have been executed by firing squads; they had multiple gunshot wounds, sometimes as many as thirty, and had their hands and upper arms bound behind them,as if they had been tied standing to a post.26 The eyes were blindfolded with articles of clothing such as a Kurdish cummerbund or headscarf. The bodies had been stripped of their wristwatches, IDs and other personal possessions.  However the bodies arrived, the entire operation was shrouded in secrecy, and morgue staff were ordered (under threat of death) neither to contact the relatives of the deceased nor to divulge their names to anyone else in the hospital. Doctors on duty in the morgue were not allowed to touch or examine the bodies; their duty was merely to furnish death certificates. If the cadavers arrived during daylight hours, the entire area around the morgue would be cordoned off by Amn guards and other hospital personnel warned away from the area. Amn personnel would even take charge of the morgue's freezer facilities until municipal employees arrived to take the corpses away for secret burial in the paupers' section of the Erbil cemetery. If an especially large number of corpses was involved, a bulldozer would be commandeered from a local private contractor to dig a mass grave. The morgue staff were forbidden to wash the bodies or otherwise prepare them for burial facing Mecca, as Islamic ritual demands. 'Dogs have no relation to Islam,' an Amn officer told one employee.27  When Hassan Naduri arrived at the Republic Hospital on the morning of April 17, 1987, every doctor in the hospital was busy dealing with the emergency. The officer was accompanied by two other Amn agents; a large number of guards also remained outside in the hospital courtyard. According to some witnesses, Hassan Naduri was accompanied by Ibrahim Zangana, the governor of Erbil, and by a local Ba'ath Partyofficial known only by his first name, Abd-al-Mon'em. The Amn officers questioned the hospital guards, demanding to know where the new patients were from and who the doctors were who were treating them. They then repeated these questions to the medical personnel, and demanded to know what treatment was being given. With these questions answered, Capt. Naduri telephoned Amn headquarters for instructions. After hanging up, he ordered that all treatment cease immediately. He told the doctors to remove the dressings from their patients' wounds. The doctors asked why. The captain responded that he had received orders from his superiors to transfer all the patients to the city's Military Hospital. At first, the hospital staff demurred, but the three Amn agents drew their pistols and ordered them to stop what they were doing at once. Otherwise they would be taken off to Amn headquarters themselves.  After a second phone call, this time ostensibly to the Military Hospital, a number of ambulances or trucks arrived and took the patients away, together with those who had remained, for a full hour now, in the three parked coasters. Later that day, the doctors telephoned the Military Hospital to check on the condition of their patients. But they had never arrived there, and the doctors never saw any of the survivors of the Balisan Valley chemical attack again. They heard later that loaded military ambulances had been seen driving off in the direction of Makhmour, to the southwest of Erbil.  In fact, a handful of survivors told Middle East Watch, the Balisan Valley victims were taken to a former police station that was now an Amn detention center, a stark white cement building in the Arab quarter of the city, near the Baiz casino. There was a chaotic scene on arrival, as Amn agents attempted to sort out the detainees by age and sex, and in the confusion several people managed to escape. At least one woman fled leaving her children behind. Those who remained were thrown into locked cells, guarded by uniformed agents--some dressed all in green and others all in blue. Here they were held for several days with neither food, blankets nor medical attention.  Hamoud Sa'id Ahmad is an employee of the municipal morgue attached to Erbil's Republic Hospital, a dignified middle-aged man who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Over the next few days, he was summoned on a number of occasions to the Amn jail in the city's Teirawa quarter and ordered to pick up bodies and prepare them for burial. Over a three-day period he counted sixty-four bodies. Arriving to collect them, he saw other prisoners wandering around in the prison courtyard building. Some hada clear fluid oozing from their mouths; others had dark, burn-like marks on their bodies, especially on the throat and hands. He saw men, women and children in detention, including several nursing babies in their mothers' arms. The bodies, kept in a separate locked cell, bore similar marks. None showed any signs of gunshot wounds. Most of the dead appeared to be children and elderly people. An Amn official told Ahmad that 'they are saboteurs, all saboteurs we attacked with chemical weapons.' An ambulance driver told Ahmad that he recognized one of the dead as a Republic Hospital employee from Sheikh Wasan.  Family members waiting outside the jail for news said that the detainees were being held as hostages, to compel their peshmerga relatives to surrender. On the last of his three visits, Ahmad saw two large buses pull up outside the prison, their windows sealed with cloths. Later in the day, a female prisoner managed to whisper to him, 'Do you know what the buses were doing here? They took all the men away, to the south, like the Barzanis [in 1983].' The men were never seen alive again.28  After the mass disappearance of the men, the surviving women and children were taken out during the night and driven off in the direction of Khalifan, three hours to the northeast of Erbil. At a place called Alana, they were dumped in an open plain, on the banks of a river, and left to fend for themselves. They were reunited here with the Balisan Valley villagers who had fled to Suleimaniyeh. These people reported that they had been detained there in a converted hospital that was guarded by Amn agents and off limits to civilians. (There is no independent account of what happened to their menfolk, some of whom also disappeared.)  At Alana, the mother who had escaped from the Amn jail in Erbil was reunited with her children. She recognized families from the villages of Kaniberd and Tutma, as well as from Sheikh Wasan and Balisan, who told her that many children had died in this place of hunger, thirst and exposure. (With the exception of a few villages, the entire Balisan Valley had been evacuated in terror: Ironically, as we shall see, their flight mayhave saved thousands of lives during the following year's Anfal campaign.) Eventually, sympathetic Kurdish residents of the town of Khalifan took some of the survivors into their homes--'in their arms and on their backs'--and cared for them until they regained their health and strength. Other survivors ended up in the squalid government complex of Seruchawa, where so many of their fellow villagers had fled on the night of the chemical attack. When the elderly mullah of Balisan went to Ba'ath Party officials at Seruchawa to plead for an improvement in conditions in the complex, he was told contemptuously, 'You're not human beings.'29  * * *   On the basis of interviews with four survivors, and with a number of medical and morgue personnel in Erbil, it is possible to give a rough estimate of the numbers who died as a result of the chemical bombing of Balisan, Sheikh Wasan and neighboring villages.  · Twenty-four deaths in Balisan, as a direct result of exposure to chemical weapons; these people were buried in a mass grave in the village;  · 103 deaths in Sheikh Wasan, including about fifty buried in a mass grave in the complex of Seruchawa. The dead included thirty-three children aged under four, another twenty-eight aged 5-14, and nine elderly people, aged 60-85;30  · Eight or nine deaths in the hospital at Raniya;  · Four dead on arrival at the Erbil Emergency Hospital;  · Between sixty-four and 142 deaths in the Amn detention center in Erbil, of untreated injuries sustained in the chemical bombing, aggravated by starvation and neglect. These included two elderly womennamed Selma Mustafa Hamid and Adila Shinko, and a nine-year old girl, Howsat Abdullah Khidr;  · Two busloads of adult men and teenage boys, disappeared from the Amn detention center in Erbil and presumed by Middle East Watch to have been executed later. A number of witnesses place the number at between seventy and seventy-six: twenty-two men from Balisan, fifty from Sheikh Wasan and four from other nearby villages. Among these were Muhammad Ibrahim Khidr, aged eighteen, and Mohsen Ibrahim Khidr, aged twelve, the two youngest sons of the mullah of Balisan;  · 'Many children' dumped on the barren plain near Khalifan.  Allowing for some overlap, Middle East Watch calculates that at least 225, and perhaps as many as 400, civilians from the Balisan Valley died as a direct or indirect result of the Iraqi air force's chemical attack on their villages on April 16, 1987.  The Sheikh Wasan and Balisan attacks are significant for a number of reasons. First, they are the earliest fully documented account of chemical attacks on civilians by the Iraqi regime. Second, they offer concrete evidence of the security forces' intent, on the orders of higher authority, to disappear and murder large numbers of civilian non-combatants from areas of conflict in Iraqi Kurdistan. In this sense, like the mass abduction of the Barzani men in 1983, the Balisan Valley disappearances directly prefigure Anfal--although with the crucial difference that women and children were directly targeted. Similarly, the treatment of those who survived the actual bombing, in particular their separation by age and sex, their illegal confinement without food or medical care, and the dumping of women and children in barren areas far from their homes, foreshadowed many of the techniques that were employed on a much vaster scale during the 1988 campaign. The Balisan Valley episode also illustrates the central role that would be played in the extermination campaign by the General Security Directorate--Amn. The events at Erbil's Republic Hospital additionally constitute the gravest possible violation of medical neutrality.  * * *   The regime was far from finished with these rebellious valleys, however. Amidst the thousands of pages of secret Iraqi intelligence reports on air-raids and village burnings, Middle East Watch researchers discovered one that contained an intriguing detail. It is a brief report from Amn Erbil, dated June 11, 1987, on a recent airstrike on five villages in the Malakan Valley, a few miles to the east of Balisan and Sheikh Wasan. In the course of the attack, it noted, 'thirty persons lost their eyesight.' Two of the victims were named. Here was an unmistakable fingerprint, for there is only one kind of weapon that characteristically causes blindness, and that is poison gas.31 During a subsequent field-trip to Iraqi Kurdistan, it proved possible to interview one of the blinded survivors--one of many occasions on which a precise match could be made between documentary and testimonial evidence.  The man's name was Kamal, and he was living in Choman, a destroyed town on the road from Rawanduz to Iran.32 An active peshmerga, Kamal had already experienced chemical warfare in the Jafati Valley, and his account of the April 15 attack there is included above at pp.59-61. Hearing the news of the devastating attack on the Balisan Valley the next day, he rushed back to his family in the nearby village of Upper Bileh. He found that they had taken refuge in some caves in the mountains. It was bitterly cold, and Kamal persuaded them to return cautiously to their homes.  At 6:00 a.m on May 27, his wife woke him to warn him that the village was under attack.  'We knew it was chemicals because the sound [of the explosions] was not loud. There were many bombs. I told my family that it wasn't a chemical attack because I didn't want to scare them, but they knew what it was. So we began burning the branches we had stored for animal feed, and they made a very strong fire. We also soakedcloths and headscarves at the spring. My aged father was there. The attack was so intense that we were unable to leave the village; that was why we lit the fires. There was a separate spring for the women, and I told everyone, men and women, to jump into the water. The attack lasted until 10:00 a.m., and I sent my brother to the malband to get medical help. By sunset the situation was getting worse. Several people had gone blind.  After sunset we crossed the stream and moved to a rocky area outside the village. Our situation was very bad. We had all been affected by the chemicals. We had trouble seeing and we were short of breath. We had nosebleeds and fainting spells. We sent someone to the surrounding villages to fetch water, and I offered to pay them whatever they asked for. But the villagers were afraid to come, thinking that the chemicals were contagious. But people from Kandour village, who are very brave people, came to bring us milk.33  In the meantime, my brother and a companion had reached the malband, but on the way back they collapsed because they had lost their sight. People from other villages sent mules to bring them back. They were carrying some medicine and eyedrops provided by the malband. When morning came, no one had died, but things were very bad. The third malband sent us a doctor and money to buy horses that could carry us to Iran. The women with us were in a terrible state, and we had to spoon-feed them. The small children were hardly breathing. We went to Malakan, where it was colder. We thought it would be better because of the fresh air. Then we reached the Sewaka area. There were people there who raised animals and they took pity on us. They wept a lot and gave us food. Next morning we left for Warta. We had to cover our faces because the bright light hurt us like needles stuck into our eyes.'34  On the third night, the caravan of survivors reached the lower slopes of Qandil Mountain, a towering peak of almost 12,000 feet on the Iranian border south of Haj Omran. Once they reached Iran, they were given medical care. All of them lived through the ordeal but one--Kamal's eighteen-month old nephew.  * * *   The Spring 1987 Campaign:   Village Destruction and Resettlement   Five days after the Balisan Valley chemical attack, the infantry troops and bulldozers went to work on hundreds of villages in Iraqi Kurdistan. According to Resool's authoritative survey, the army obliterated at least 703 Kurdish villages from the map during the campaigns of 1987. Of these, 219 were in the Erbil area; 122 in the hilly plain known as Germian, to the southeast of Kirkuk; and 320 in various districts of the governorate of Suleimaniyeh. Badinan, too was hit, although less severely, with the Kurdistan Reconstruction and Development Society (KURDS), a local relief agency, listing fifty villages that were destroyed in Dohuk governorate. Most of the villages destroyed during Ali Hassan al-Majid's 'first and second phases' lay along the main roads and were under government control. Their removal had the effect of physically severing the peshmerga-controlled rural areas from the rest of the country.  For destruction on this scale, the Iraqi state had to deploy vast resources. Yet there were important differences between the village clearances of spring 1987 and the Anfal campaign of the following year. The most important concerned the treatment of residents of the villages destroyed by the army. The 1987 campaign offered them clear, if unpalatable alternatives; Anfal did not.  The inhabitants of Narin, for example, a village in the nahya of Qara Tapa in the southern part of Germian, were relocated in 1987 to theRamadi area, in central Iraq.32 The villagers of nearby Zerdow were warned that their turn was next. They left their homes and moved in with relatives in nearby towns or villages. Some were resettled in the newly opened complex of Benaslawa, six miles from Erbil on the site of an old Kurdish village. They were not punished otherwise, although Zerdow itself was razed to the ground with bulldozers a few days later. One family interviewed by Middle East Watch lost its livestock, furniture and food stores in the destruction of Zerdow, but was paid compensation of 1,000 dinars ($3,000 at the then-official exchange rate). Later, the family was able to build a house in Benaslawa with a 4,500 dinar loan from the state Real Estate Bank.  This was a typical pattern. The villagers were not physically harmed; some token compensation was paid, although it might be withheld if a family refused to accept relocation in the towns or complexes; there was some advance notice of the regime's intent to destroy the village (even if this was not always respected in practice). The villagers of Qishlagh Kon, for example, in the Germian nahya of Qader Karam, were told by soldiers that they had fifteen days to evacuate; in fact, the army moved in and razed their homes well before the expiry of this deadline. According to one man from this village, army troops swept through the area populated by the Kurdish Zangana tribe in April 1987, bulldozing and dynamiting between seventy and one hundred villages along the main road, spread out over three adjacent nahyas--Qader Karam, Qara Hassan and Qara Hanjir.33  Many of the villagers were offered an explicit choice by the soldiers or jahsh. 'Go to the saboteurs or join the government,' was the message delivered to one Qader Karam village of the Jabari tribe. No neutrality was to be allowed, and a person's physical location would henceforth be taken as proof of their political affiliation. Coming over to the government's side was spoken of as 'returning to the national ranks,' a phrase that appears in official documents with increasing frequency from early 1987 onward. Previous political loyalties were irrelevant to this new drawing of battle lines, and so was the size of the settlement. Several nahyaswere cleared of their population and/or destroyed during the spring 1987 campaign, including Naujul, Qaradagh, Qara Hanjir, Koks and Sengaw. Shwan followed in September. In the northernmost governorate of Dohuk, the nahya of Kani Masi was evacuated and destroyed, apparently in retaliation for a six-day takeover by KDP forces. Some of these nahyas were towns of several thousand people.  Even a strong jahsh presence offered no protection, if the town lay within a designated area of army operations. As Ali Hassan al-Majid later told a meeting of senior Ba'ath Party officials, 'I told the mustashars that the jahsh might say that they liked their villages and would not leave. I said I cannot let your villages stay because I will attack them with chemical weapons. And then you and your family will die.'34  For all the scale of the destruction, it is apparent from one batch of official Iraqi files, found in the Amn offices in Erbil and Shaqlawa, that the regime was far from satisfied with the 'first stage' of its village clearance program. A watchful, almost apprehensive tone creeps into many government documents from this period. Among the questions put to people surrendering to the authorities from peshmerga-controlled areas was one that asked, 'How are the people affected economically and psychologically by the elimination of the villages and other policies?'35  On April 20, Amn Erbil warns its branches that the new campaign of village destruction may provoke demonstrations to mark the 14th anniversary of the bombing of Qala Dizeh on the 24th. On the same day the Erbil Security Committee, presided over by Governor Ibrahim Zangana, warns that 'saboteurs' may attack government installations as a reprisal against the deportation of villagers from the 'prohibited areas' (manateq al-mahdoureh). On April 22, Governor Zangana predicts that the PUK may even try to bring in the International Committee of the Red Cross to observe the clearances. Three days later, on April 25, Amn Erbil issues an alert warning of peshmerga reprisal raids on Arab villages; it also complains that government forces destroying the village of Freez have come under attack from 'saboteurs' and that air-cover has failed to materialize as requested. By May 20, the director of Amn Shaqlawa iscomplaining to Erbil that the 'saboteurs' have been able to exploit the unpopularity of the campaign; in particular he expresses irritation that no complexes have been made ready for the villagers who are to be relocated, and that many of them have been obliged to remain in the open air, exposed to the elements.36  * * *   Early Uses of al-Majid's Special Powers   In these early months of Ali Hassan al-Majid's rule, the Ba'ath Party tightened the noose around the population of rural Kurdistan through a series of sweeping decrees and administrative orders.37  · On April 6, all 'saboteurs' lost their property rights. 'By the authority vested in us by the Revolutionary Command Council's decree number 160 of March 29, 1987,' writes al-Majid himself, 'we have decided to authorize the chairmen of the security committees [Ru'asa' al-Lijan al-Amniyeh] in the northern governorates to confiscate the real and personal property of the saboteurs, provided that their properties are liquidated within one month of the date of issuance of the confiscation decree.'38  · On April 10, al-Majid suspended the legal rights of the residents of villages prohibited for security reasons. 'His Excellency has given instructions not to hear cases brought by the population of security-prohibited villages,' writes deputy secretary Radhi Hassan Salman of the Northern Bureau Command, 'and likewise those brought by the saboteurs, no matter what their character, as well as to freeze all claims submitted previously.'39  · On May 1, al-Majid began to order the execution of first-degree relatives of 'saboteurs.' It had long been the policy of the regime to detain and punish the families of active Kurdish peshmerga, often by destroying their homes. But al-Majid now ordered their physical elimination, at least on an occasional exemplary basis. These orders evidently remained in force throughout the Anfal campaign and for some time afterwards. For example, a handwritten note dated November 20, 1989, signed 'Security Chief, Interrogating Officer,' and originating in Amn headquarters in the city of Suleimaniyeh, gives details of a case in which an Iraqi citizen has petitioned the authorities for news about his disappeared parents and brother.  The security chief's letter informs the unnamed recipient (who is addressed only as 'Your Excellency,') that the missing parents, Qoron Ahmad and his wife Na'ima Abd-al-Rahman, were 'liquidated' in Baghdad on May 19, 1987. Their son, Hushyar Ahmad, 'a member of the group of Iranian saboteurs,' was executed by hanging on July 12, 1987 by order of the Revolutionary Court (mahkamat al-thawrah). What is significant here is the reason for the killing of the man's parents. It was ordered, the document explains, 'in compliance with the order from the StrugglingComrade Ali Hassan al-Majid, member of the Regional Command [of the Ba'ath Party] that was relayed to us by letter no. 106309 of the Security Directorate of the Autonomous Region, marked 'Secret and to be Opened Personally,' and dated May 1, 1987, regarding the liquidation of first-degree relatives of criminals.'  Another letter on Amn Suleimaniyeh letterhead, numbered S-T: 21308, dated September 16, 1989 and classified 'Top Secret,' describes the public execution by firing squad of five 'criminals' with a 'connection to the internal organizations of the agents of Iran.' The execution had been carried out on October 24, 1987 in the presence of intelligence and Ba'ath Party officials.40 Some time afterwards, 'it was decided that three families of the criminals...should be executed in a discreet manner.' The authority for their execution was given by letter number 6806, dated December 12, 1987, from the Northern Bureau Command.  · Wounded civilians could now also be executed, according to a hand-written communication (no. 3324) of May 14 from the Security Director of the city of Halabja, in southeastern Iraqi Kurdistan, to Amn Suleimaniyeh. This note gives details of an operation against the city's Kani Ashqan neighborhood, and makes reference to a cable (no. 945), dated the previous day, from the Command of the Fifth Army Corps. 'It was by order of the Commander of the First Army Corps, on the recommendation of Comrade Ali Hassan al-Majid, to execute the wounded civilians after confirming their hostility to the authorities with the Party Organization, the Security andPolice Departments and the Intelligence Center, and to utilize backhoes and bulldozers to raze the neighborhood of Kani Ashqan.'41  * * *   Orders for Mass Killing   The full extent of the Iraqi regime's intentions, however, are spelled out with brutal clarity in two directives issued by al-Majid's office in June 1987. Both documents lay out, in the most explicit detail, a prohibition on all human life in designated areas of the Kurdish countryside, covering more than 1,000 villages, to be applied through a shoot-to-kill order for which no subsequent higher authorization is required.  The first is a personal directive, numbered 28/3650, signed by Ali Hassan al-Majid himself and dated June 3, 1987. Addressed to a number of civilian and military agencies, including the Commanders of the First, Second and Fifth Army Corps, the Security Directorate (Amn) of the Autonomous Region, the Istikhbarat and Mukhabarat, it states the following:  1. It is totally prohibited for any foodstuffs or persons or machinery to reach the villages that have been prohibited for security reasons that are included in the second stage of collecting the villages. Anyone who so desires is permitted to return to the national ranks. It is not allowed for relatives to contact them except with the knowledge of the security agencies.  2. The presence of the people from relocated areas who are from villages prohibited for security reasons includedin the first stage until June 21, 1987, is prohibited for the areas included in the second stage.42  3. Concerning the harvest: after the conclusion of winter, which must end before July 15, farming will not be authorized in [the area] during the coming winter and summer seasons, starting this year.  4. It is prohibited to take cattle to pasture within these areas.  5. Within their jurisdiction, the armed forces must kill any human being or animal present within these areas. They are totally prohibited. (emphasis added)  6. The persons who are to be included in the relocation to the complexes will be notified of this decision, and they will bear full responsibility if they violate it.  These orders were evidently relayed later to the lower echelons in the chain of command. They are repeated word for word, for example, in a letter (no. 4754), dated June 8, 1987, from Amn Erbil to all its departments and local offices.  Three days after al-Majid's directive, on June 6, Radhi Hassan Salman, deputy secretary of the Northern Bureau Command, issued a series of general instructions to all army corps commanders, 'aimed at ending the long line of traitors from the Barzani and Talabani clans and the Communist Party, who have joined ranks with the Iranian invader enemy with a view to enabling it to acquire territory belonging to the cherished homeland.' Salman ordered increased combat readiness, improved intelligence and a heightened state of alert among all units, whileat the same time betraying a certain anxiety about renewed peshmerga attacks designed 'to cut the chain of command.'43  The most important document of all, however, was issued on June 20, 1987. Issued by the Northern Bureau Command over Ali Hassan al-Majid's signature, and additionally stamped with the seal of the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee, this directive, coded SF/4008, amended and expanded the June 3 instructions in a number of very important ways--including a direct incitement to pillage, in clear violation of the rules of war, and the baldest possible statement of a policy of mass murder, ordered by the highest levels of the Iraqi regime. From the repeated references to it in official documents throughout 1988, it is apparent that directive 4008 remained in force as the standing orders for the Iraqi armed forces and security services during the Anfal campaign and beyond. For example, a letter from Amn Suleimaniyeh, dated October 29, 1988, makes reference to the directive as the basis for 'the execution of 19 accused, executed by this directorate because of their presence in the security-prohibited villages.'  It is quite apparent that al-Majid's demand for the summary killing of people arrested in the prohibited areas caused some consternation among those who were charged with carrying out his orders. Throughout 1987 and 1988, high-level Iraqi officials issued a steady stream of ill-tempered clarifications of clause 5 of directive SF/4008--the paragraph that concerns executions. 'The security agencies should not trouble us with queries about clause 5,' complains a Northern Bureau letter of December 1987; 'the wording is self-explanatory and requires no higher authority.'44 Instructions from Amn Erbil, dated November 22, 1988, insist that clause 5 must be 'implemented without exception.'  The full text of directive SF/4008 reads:  June 20, 1987  From: Northern Bureau Command  To: First Corps Command, Second Corps Command, Fifth Corps Command45  Subject: Procedure to deal with the villages that are prohibited  for security reasons  In view of the fact that the officially announced deadline for the amalgamation of these villages expires on June 21, 1987, we have decided that the following action should be taken with effect from June 22, 1987:  1. All the villages in which subversives, agents of Iran and similar traitors to Iraq are still to be found shall be regarded as out of bounds for security reasons;  2. They shall be regarded as operational zones that are strictly out of bounds to all persons and animals and in which the troops can open fire at will, without any restrictions, unless otherwise instructed by our Bureau;  3. Travel to and from these zones, as well as all agricultural, animal husbandry and industrial activities shall be prohibited and carefully monitored by all the competent agencies within their respective fields of jurisdiction;  4. The corps commanders shall carry out random bombardments using artillery, helicopters and aircraft, at all times of the day or night in order to kill the largest number of persons present in those prohibited zones, keeping us informed of the results; [emphasis added]  5. All persons captured in those villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them, of which we should be duly notified; [emphasis added]  6. Those who surrender to the governmental or Party authorities shall be interrogated by the competent agencies for a maximum period of three days, which may be extended to ten days if necessary, provided that we are notified of such cases. If the interrogation requires a longer period of time, approval must be obtained from us by telephone or telegraph or through comrade Taher [Tawfiq] al-Ani;  7. Everything seized by the advisers [mustashars] and troops of the National Defense Battalions shall be retained by them, with the exception of heavy, mounted and medium weapons.46 They can keep the light weapons, notifying us only of the number of these weapons. The Corps commanders shall promptly bring this to the attention of all the advisers, company commanders and platoon leaders and shall provide us with detailed information concerning their activities in the National Defense Battalions. [emphasis added]  For information and action within your respective fields of jurisdiction. Keep us informed.  [Signed]  Comrade  Ali Hassan al-Majid  Member of the Regional Command  Secretary General of the Northern Bureau  cc: Chairman of the Legislative Council;  Chairman of the Executive Council;  Party Intelligence;  Chief of the Army General Staff;  Governors (Chairmen of the Security Committees) of Nineveh,  al-Ta'mim, Diyala, Salah al-Din, Suleimaniyeh, Erbil and Dohuk;  Branch Secretaries of the above-mentioned governorates;  General Directorate of Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat);  General Directorate of Security (Amn);  Director of Security of the Autonomous Region;  Security Services of the Northern Region;  Security Services of the Eastern Region;  Security Directors of the governorates of Nineveh, al-Ta'mim,  Diyala, Salah al-Din, Suleimaniyeh, Erbil and Dohuk.  Ali Hassan al-Majid evidently insisted on a high degree of personal control of even the smallest details of the campaign. For example, one order issued in the middle of the Anfal operation indicates that no town or village may be searched without his express personal approval.47 Nonetheless, the list of institutions to whom his June 20 directive was copied gives some hint of the bureaucratic scope of the effort and the large number of civilian, party, military and security agencies involved in its execution.  * * *   Defining the 'National Ranks':   The Census of October 17, 1987   After June 20, the village destruction campaign temporarily abated. Although it had also targeted areas near the smaller roads that criss-cross Iraqi Kurdistan, its most striking effect was to remove a broad swathe of formerly government-controlled villages close to the highway that runs from Mosul to Erbil, Kirkuk and Tuz Khurmatu, before turning east through Kifri, Kalar, Peibaz and Darbandikhan. For the time being, the Iran-Iraq War deprived the regime of the military muscle that would have been required to press the campaign any further. But the political and bureaucratic logic of the spring 1987 clearances--as well as the incipient logic of Anfal--became apparent during the second half of the year. This was to effect a sharp division between the 'national ranks' and thegenerally more mountainous peshmerga-controlled regions to the east and north. These were the 'prohibited areas' (manateq al-mahdoureh) and their inhabitants, regardless of age or sex, would be regarded without exception as 'saboteurs.'  They would, however, be given one last chance to change sides. As al-Majid's June 3 directive stated, it was still possible for Kurds to 'return to the national ranks' --in other words to move to the cities, towns or mujamma'at and align themselves with the regime. To keep a close track, family by family, of how the two sides lined up, the Iraqi regime had an ideal instrument to hand, in the form of a national census. Iraq had carried out five censuses in the half-century since its independence. The results of the most recent, conducted in 1977, were classified as 'secret.' Designed to be held every decade, another was due in 1987. It was scheduled for October 17.  As the census date drew near, the authorities repeatedly insisted on improving security and intelligence measures to inhibit any contact or movement between the two sides, other than on the regime's terms. Amn Erbil ordered renewed vigilance on the complexes of Benaslawa, Daratou and Kawar Gosek, which all housed villagers relocated during the spring 1987 campaign.48 Orders were issued to seize and destroy tractors, since these might help the 'saboteurs' skirt the economic blockade of the prohibited areas. The tractor owners in question were to receive 'the maximum exemplary punishment.'49  On September 6, Ali Hassan al-Majid chaired a meeting of senior Ba'ath Party officials to discuss preparations for the census. Case by case, individual by individual, the make-up of the two sides was to be refined in the most legalistic fashion. 'Subversives who repent' were to be allowed to return to the fold right up to the day of the census. No such returnees would be accepted after October 17, however, 'even if they surrender their weapons.' At the same time, al-Majid regarded it as unacceptable for thefamilies of unrepentant saboteurs to remain in government-controlled areas. These people were to be physically removed and forced to join their saboteur kin in the prohibited areas.  This general policy had been in effect for at least two years.50 But al-Majid now demanded a full inventory of all such cases from the security committees of each of the northern governorates. This list was to reach his desk not later than September 15. As soon as it was complete, 'the families in question should be expelled to the regions where their subversive relatives are, with the sole exception of males aged between 12 and 50 inclusive, who should be detained.'51  The local security agencies appear to have cooperated with alacrity. Middle East Watch has examined dozens of individual expulsion orders by Amn Erbil, for example, during this pre-census period. One typical case in mid-September 1987 gives the full names, addresses, dates of birth and residence permit numbers of eighty women, children and old men aged from 51-89, taken from their homes and summarily expelled 'to thoseregions where the saboteurs are present.'52 A single male relative born in 1949 is mentioned as having been detained 'to receive the proper sentence.'  Most strikingly of all, the Northern Bureau Command ordered that:  Mass seminars and administrative meetings shall be organized to discuss the importance of the general census, scheduled to take place on October 17, 1987. It shall be clearly emphasized that any persons who fail to participate in the census without a valid excuse shall lose their Iraqi citizenship. They shall also be regarded as army deserters and as such shall be subject to the terms of Revolutionary Command Council decree no. 677 of August 26, 1987.  The importance of this provision can scarcely be overstated, for RCC decree 677 stipulated that, 'The death sentence shall be carried out by Party organizations, after due verification, on any deserters who are arrested, should the period of their flight or delinquency exceed one year or should they have perpetrated the crime of desertion more than once.' [emphasis in original]53 Failure to register under the census, in other words, could in itself be tantamount to the death penalty.  The results of the 1987 census were never publicly divulged. Employees of the government census office in Suleimaniyeh told Middle East Watch that they estimated it to have been only 70% accurate--no doubtbecause large expanses of Iraqi Kurdistan, as well of the rebellious southern marshes, could not be included. Most residents of the 'prohibited areas' opted to stay where they were; some, especially in the more remote parts of the Badinan region, said they never even learned that the census was taking place, despite a vigorous campaign conducted over government radio and television.  The instructions were quite different from those of the five previous censuses. Those who were not included in the census would no longer be considered Iraqi nationals, the official broadcasts announced; they would cease to be eligible for government services and food rations. Only two options were offered by the census: one could either be an Arab or a Kurd--nothing else. These ethnic lines were drawn with great rigidity. A number of official documents from 1988 and 1989 transmit orders from Saddam Hussein and Ali Hassan al-Majid to the effect that any citizen may become an Arab by simple written application. By contrast, anyone wishing to be considered a Kurd will be subject to the destruction of their homes and deportation to the Autonomous Region.  People could be counted only if they made themselves accessible to the census-takers. For anyone living in a prohibited area, this meant abandoning one's home. Inclusion in the census involved registering oneself as the resident of a government-controlled town or mujamma'a. (The only hope of evading this regulation was to bribe an official--a time-honored means of survival in Iraq, which continued to apply even during Anfal.) Villages that had been destroyed in earlier army operations--the Arabization drive of 1975, the border clearances of the late 1970s, or the spring 1987 campaign--no longer existed as far as the government in Baghdad was concerned. Some inhabitants of the border zone had returned illegally to their homes to rebuild, but the census would not count them. The remainder were now in complexes.  As a partial indication of the scale of this exclusion, government statisticians provided Middle East Watch with figures for Suleimaniyeh, one of the four governorates in the Autonomous Region of Iraqi Kurdistan. The 1977 census had counted 1,877 villages in Suleimaniyeh; by the time of the 1987 census, this number was down to just 186. Almost 1,700 villages had thus disappeared from the official map. Of these, several hundred had been destroyed during the border clearances of the 1970s and at various stages of the war against Iran. Most of their inhabitants had been resettled in the nine complexes that were also listed in the 1987census. The remaining villages were simply not counted, because they now lay in 'prohibited areas' of peshmerga influence.  Once the population count was complete, the consequences of not registering soon became apparent. Shelling and aerial bombing intensified. When families went to the nearest town to seek their food rations, said one man from a village near Qara Dagh, they were told that they could now forget about them. 'You are Iranians,' officials said, 'Go to the Iranians for your food rations!'54 The same was true of villagers seeking marriage licenses or government permits for other civil transactions.  On October 18, the day after the census, Taher Tawfiq, secretary of the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee, issued a stern memorandum to all security committees in Kurdistan, reminding them that aerial inspection would ensure that Directive no.4008 of June 20 was being carried out 'to the letter.' Any committee that failed to comply would 'bear full responsibility before the Comrade Bureau Chief'--that is to say, Ali Hassan al-Majid.55 Several other documents from late 1987 insist, in a tone of distinct irritation, that paragraph 5 (mandating summary execution after interrogation) does not require the authorization of higher authority on a case-by-case basis. The Northern Bureau should no longer be troubled by these requests, since the standing orders are quite explicit.  The blockade of the north was now to be made even more systematic. On September 29, al-Majid agreed to a set of harsh new proposals from an ad-hoc committee chaired by Taher Tawfiq and including Khaled Muhammad Abbas, head of Eastern Sector Istikhbarat, Farhan Mutlaq Saleh, head of Northern Sector Istikhbarat, and Abd-al-Rahman Aziz Hussein, director of Amn for the Autonomous Region. The group complained that food, medicines, fuel and other supplies were still getting through to the 'saboteurs.' Accordingly, security would be steppedup at checkpoints; many grocery stores in the towns would be closed down; the secret police would monitor the stocks in all restaurants, bakeries and cafes; and a strict ban would be enforced on the sale of all agricultural produce from prohibited areas. Food rations would be cut back to the minimum necessary for human survival. The loyalty of all workers in the food distribution sector would be evaluated.56  Under this bitter regime, the inhabitants of the prohibited areas struggled to survive. During Ali Hassan al-Majid's first eight months in office, the groundwork for a 'final solution' of Iraq's Kurdish problem had been laid. Its logic was apparent; its chain of command was set in place. But the events of 1987 were 'just a preliminary step,' a former Istikhbarat officer explained, 'because the war was still going on. The Iraqi government was not so strong and many troops were tied up on the front. They postponed the anger and hate in their hearts'--but only until the beginning of 1988, when the major winter offensive that Baghdad had feared failed to materialize, and Iran's fortunes on the battlefield began rapidly to decline.  ______   1 The marshes have been the object of a vast engineering scheme designed to bring the rebellious south under the control of the central government in Baghdad. The regime's treatment of the Shi'a inhabitants of the south, including the Ma'dan, or Marsh Arabs, is detailed in the Middle East Watch report, 'Current Human Rights Conditions among the Iraqi Shi'a,' March 1993.  2 The Northern Bureau is one of four regional bureaus of the Ba'ath, and is quite separate from the Northern Affairs Committee of the Revolutionary Command Council. Other party bureaus have responsibility for the South, the Center, and the capital city of Baghdad. This division of Iraq into security zones is mirrored by the four-bureau organization of Amn and military intelligence (Istikhbarat).  3 The family tree is shown in Simon Henderson, Instant Empire: Saddam Hussein's Ambition for Iraq (San Francisco: Mercury House, 1991), p.87. Other notable cousins of Saddam's include the former Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah, who died in a helicopter crash in 1989, and Hussein Kamel Majid, Minister of Industry and Military Industry.  4 Middle East Watch interview with former mustashar, Zakho, September 1, 1992. In 1989 al-Majid was appointed as Minister of the Interior, and then, after the August 1990 invasion, as governor of Kuwait. He is now Iraq's Defense Minister, and continues to be implicated in actions of the grossest brutality. According to an eyewitness, Majid personally shot to death some 25-30 detainees in Basra Prison on April 3 or 4, 1991. The dead included six children. See Middle East Watch, 'Current Human Rights Conditions Among the Iraqi Shi'a,' March 5, 1993.  5 The Iraqi Army has seven regular corps in all. The term 'special forces' requires some explanation. In the U.S. armed forces and others built on the U.S. model, these are light infantry forces designed to conduct irregular missions such as guerrilla warfare and covert operations. Iraq's special forces, by contrast, are mobile elite infantry units, armed with the best available weapons and often supported by tank battalions. Growing out of the Iran-Iraq War, they have been compared to the German Stosstruppen of World War One. See 'Iraqi Order of Battle: Ground Troops,' in Desert Shield Factbook (Bloomington, IN: GDW, 1991), pp.50-59.  6 The basic texts on the war include Edgar O'Ballance, The Gulf War (London: Brassey's, 1988); Dilip Hiro, The Longest War: The Iran-Iraq Military Conflict (New York: Routledge, 1991); Shahram Chubin and Charles Tripp, Iran and Iraq at War (Boulder: Westview Press, second revised edn., 1991); and Cordesman and Wagner, The Lessons of Modern War, Volume II. Most of these books share the defect of neglecting the temporary revival of Iran's fortunes in the final year and a half of the war--without which it is difficult to understand the relationship between the first Gulf War and the Anfal campaign. A useful corrective is Richard Jupa and James Dingeman, Gulf Wars: How Iraq Won the First and Lost the Second. Will There Be a Third? (Cambria, CA: 3W Publications, c.1991), pp.1-9.  7 The basij, or Mobilization Unit, were virtually untrained volunteers under pasdaran supervision. They were integral to Iran's conception of an 'Islamic warfare' that depended more on faith than on technology and conventional military skills. See Chubin and Tripp, Iran and Iraq at War, pp.42-49.  8 See, for example, Cordesman and Wagner, op cit, p.257.  9 The KDP and PUK eventually reached formal military and political agreements to collaborate in November 1987, and in 1988 formed the Iraqi Kurdistan Front. Five smaller parties later joined the Front.  10 According to comments by Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin in an April 1987 interview with Le Monde, one option under consideration by the PUK was 'the severance of Iraq into a number of small states: Shi'a, Kurdish and Sunni.' Cited in Baram, op. cit., p.127.  11 Cordesman and Wagner, op. cit., pp.259-260. O'Ballance also echoes this view, but provides less detail.  12 Audiotape of a conversation between Ali Hassan al-Majid and unnamed Ba'ath Party aides, January 22, 1989.  13 Ibid. For the full text, see appendix A, pp.351-352.  14 Special National Defense Forces General Staff (Operations) to Fifth Corps Command, Erbil: letter no. 28/573, dated April 13, 1987 and classified 'Top Secret and Confidential.' The town of Makhmour lies some thirty-five miles southwest of Erbil.  15 Minutes of Shaqlawa Security Committee meeting, April 4, 1987.  16 Middle East Watch interview, Zakho, June 24, 1992.  17 Middle East Watch interview, Choman, March 23, 1993. There was also reportedly a chemical attack on April 15, 1987 on the KDP headquarters in Zewa, a largely depopulated area close to the Turkish border.  18 The PUK had four malbands altogether. The first, based in the Qara Dagh mountains, was responsible for political and military affairs in the governorate of Suleimaniyeh. The second, in the Jafati Valley, was in charge of operations in Kirkuk (al-Ta'mim). The third and fourth, based in the Balisan Valley and the adjoining Smaquli Valley, shared responsibility for the PUK's work in Erbil. Later, the third and fourth malbands were merged; under the PUK-KDP unity agreements, a new fourth malband was opened in Zewa, the KDP headquarters on the Turkish border, to handle operations in the governorate of Dohuk.  19 Population figures for Balisan and Sheikh Wasan are derived from Resool's dossier of destroyed villages, although villagers interviewed by Middle East Watch suggested that Balisan may have been even larger, with perhaps as many as 525 households. Officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees assume an average household size of seven persons in Kurdish villages.  20 Not coincidentally, the Iraqi intelligence agencies were mainly equipped and trained by their East German equivalents. It may well be that the files of the former Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi) will shed further light on this relationship.  21 The symptoms described by villagers are generally consistent with the effects of mustard gas--although reports that some victims died immediately suggest that nerve agents may also have been used, since mustard gas, even in high concentrations, is not usually lethal for at least half an hour. See Physicians for Human Rights, loc. cit..  22 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, March 16, 1993.  23 In an interesting, if indirect confirmation of the May 16 attack, an undated handwritten note from Amn Shaqlawa also mentions that sixteen Iranian Revolutionary Guards (pasdaran) were present during a bombing raid on the villages of Balisan, Sheikh Wasan and Tutma. The pasdaran are reported to have 'made fires which saved their lives'--a reference which cannot conceivably apply to anything but an attempted defense against poison gas. A separate Amn Shaqlawa document in the same file, dated May 20, 1987, notes that three members of the PUK Politburo are reported to have been injured by gas during 'the latest military attacks in Kurdistan.'  24 These workhorse vehicles are ubiquitous in Iraq. They are commonly known simply as 'coasters,' and are referred to by that name throughout this text.  25 Middle East Watch interview, Balisan, April 30, 1992.  26 This is consistent with the procedures of an Iraqi firing squad, as recorded on a videotape that has been viewed by Middle East Watch. Five prisoners in Kurdish clothes are blindfolded, tied to posts and machinegunned with almost luxurious excess by a line of troops with AK-47s. The firing continues long after it is obvious that the prisoners are dead. Even then, a uniformed officer delivers the coup de grace to each man with a pistol. There is a pause. Finally, another officer moves down the line, discharging his pistol into the fallen bodies. This particular execution was carried out in a public square in front of a large crowd, and was greeted with applause from party and security dignitaries in the front row.  27 This account is based on Middle East Watch interviews in Erbil, April 23-25, 1992.  28 The bodies of those who died in custody were exhumed from the Erbil cemetery in September 1991, and reburied in a ceremony that was recorded on videotape. In the course of later exhumations Hamoud Sa'id Ahmad discovered the body of his own brother, who was killed by Amn in a separate incident in April 1988. Ahmad was interviewed by Middle East Watch in Erbil, April 25, 1992. For additional detail, see Middle East Watch/Physicians for Human Rights, Unquiet Graves: The Search for the Disappeared in Iraqi Kurdistan, February 1992.  29 Middle East Watch interview with Sheikh Qader Sa'id Ibrahim Balisani, Balisan, April 30, 1992.  30 A handwritten list of 103 dead and forty-eight injured villagers was given to Middle East Watch in 1992 by the Inspection Committee of Oppressed Kurds, a human rights group in Erbil.  31 Amn Erbil governorate to Amn Shaqlawa, letter no. Sh Sh/4947, dated June 11, 1987, and classified secret. Exposure to mustard gas causes prolonged temporary blindness or vision impairment, and dozens of survivors interviewed by Middle East Watch described being blind for at least a month after a chemical attack.  32 Middle East Watch interview, Choman, March 23, 1993.  33 Kandour is one of the five villages named in the Amn report on the May 27 attack. The others are Malakan, Talinan and Upper and Lower Bileh.  34 The symptoms described by Kamal are entirely consistent with exposure to mustard gas.  32 There are two basic administrative divisions within each Iraqi governorate: the qadha and the smaller nahya. The nahya of Qara Tapa belongs to the qadha of Kifri. The examples of Narin and Zerdow are drawn from a Middle East Watch interview, Benaslawa complex, July 7, 1992.  33 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, July 23, 1992.  34 Audiotape of a meeting between Ali Hassan al-Majid and senior Ba'ath Party officials, Kirkuk, May 26, 1988.  35 June 1987 statement by a 'returnee to the national ranks,' found in Amn files.  36 Since few villages were destroyed in the Shaqlawa area at this time, other than those in the Balisan Valley, it is possible that this may refer to the dumping of the survivors of the chemical attack, at Alana. See above p.68-69.  37 The power structure of the Ba'ath Party is complex, and a full grasp of the chain of command in the anti-Kurdish campaigns depends on understanding the nuances that distinguish several overlapping bodies. As one national branch of the Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party, the Iraqi Ba'ath has a Regional Command--of which Ali Hassan al-Majid had been a member since 1986. Within Iraq, the highest executive body is formally the Revolutionary Command Council, which did not include al-Majid--although in practice ultimate power is wielded by Saddam Hussein himself and a largely Tikrit-based group of loyalists from the military and security sectors, many of them related to the president. Al-Majid is a key member of this fraternity.  The RCC in turn has a number of regionally based committees, including its Northern Affairs Committee. Saddam Hussein was secretary of this committee at the time of the 1970 autonomy manifesto. In 1987-1988, the post was held by Taher Tawfiq, who, as an RCC member, was thus technically al-Majid's superior--although the temporary special powers granted to al-Majid under decree 160 superseded this. Al-Majid himself was Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party Northern Bureau; to complicate matters further, the Northern Bureau Command was a parallel but separate entity, under Taher Tawfiq. The Northern Bureau and Northern Bureau Command are clearly distinguished where necessary in the text.  38 Northern Bureau letter S Sh/18/2396, April 6, 1987.  39 Northern Bureau Command letter no. 1/2713, April 10, 1987.  40 The principle of collective implication in executions, including an insistence that party members form part of the firing squads, is a well-established element of Ba'ath Party rule. The most notorious example of this was the televised purge of two dozen senior Ba'ath officials and military officers, including several members of the Revolutionary Command Council, in July 1979--a month after Saddam Hussein had assumed the presidency. In front of a roomful of their peers, the condemned men make ritual confessions on charges of treason in front of a roomful of their peers and are then whisked away to be killed. A tearful Saddam implores--and thus effectively orders--other senior Ba'athis to take part in the execution squad. See al-Khalil, Republic of Fear, pp.70-72. Also Chibli Malat, 'Obstacles to Democratization in Iraq: A Reading of Post-Revolutionary Iraqi History through the Gulf War,' unpublished paper, 1992--which differs from al-Khalil in other important respects about the nature of the Ba'ath's exercise of power.  41 This exemplary collective punishment, according to a former resident interviewed by Middle East Watch in Halabja on June 11, 1992, was meted out in retaliation for an anti-government demonstration. Some 1,500 homes were reportedly destroyed.  42 By now it appears that the two phases originally envisioned (April 21-May 20 and May 21-June 20) have been collapsed into one single operation. In this order, the 'second stage' is clearly intended to begin on June 21.  43 Northern Bureau Command letter reference no. 28/3726, dated June 6, 1987 and classified 'highly confidential and personal.'

This clause of decree SF/4008, with its reference to booty, may offer some hint of the connection between the coming campaign and the concept of Anfal in the Koranic sense (see above, pp.31-32). Army documents reviewing the Anfal campaign make further reference to the approved role of the jahsh in seizing booty. See p. 289.  47 Northern Bureau Command letter no. 3321, July 6, 1988, cited in Amn Suleimaniyeh circular to all security directorates (number illegible), July 16, 1988.  48 This letter also urged that 'saboteurs should be dealt with strongly, like the Iranian enemy.'

In those instances, only the mother is to be expelled, together with any subversive sons.' The summary conclusions of the September 6 meeting are included in a cable, reference 4350, dated September 7, 1987, from the Northern Bureau to all regional security committees. These instructions evidently received very wide distribution. Middle East Watch has also found a second version of this document, in the form of a letter, number 2/237, classified 'secret, urgent and immediate' and dated September 19, 1987, from the Shaqlawa district security committee to a number of local party and police agencies. Although in other respects identical, it gives the ages of those to be detained as '17 to 50.' Whatever the final regulation on minimum age may have been--12, 15 or 17--it is apparent from survivor testimonies that the separation of those to be killed during Anfal depended less on birth certificates than on a quick visual inspection of the prisoners. See below p.212.  52 Amn Erbil to Erbil Police Directorate, letters nos. 9475 and 9478, September 16 and 17, 1987, classified 'secret.'

Both were signed by Saddam Hussein as Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council. Two additional comments are pertinent here. First, the census gave the regime a means of detecting deserters, a perennial problem for the Iraqi military. Second, and more important, it specified that executions of deserters would be carried out by agents of the Ba'ath Party itself--a hint, perhaps, of the identity of the executioners during the Anfal campaign.  54 Middle East Watch interview, Naser complex, July 28, 1992.

The nerve center of Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan lay deep in the mountains of Suleimaniyeh governorate in southeastern Iraqi Kurdistan. The organization's most important facilities were all housed here, in the long, narrow Jafati valley, so called because its inhabitants belonged to the important Jaf tribe. The PUK's top command, its politburo, had its headquarters in the small village of Yakhsamar. Nearby Bergalou ('Lower Valley'), a temporary settlement, was home to the PUK's radio station and its main field hospital. Talabani's deputy commander, Naywshirwan Mustafa Amin, had also taken up residence here, and in Talabani's absence abroad it was he who commanded the PUK during Anfal. Nearby Sergalou ('Upper Valley') was home to the PUK's second malband, or regional command, responsible for peshmerga operations in the governorate of Kirkuk. Other villages such as Maluma and Zewa were important additional links in the chain of command.  Sergalou was a village, almost a small town, of some 500 households (3,500 people), a half-hour by car on an all-weather gravel road from the nearby nahya of Surdash. Although the houses were of mud and stone, they boasted cement floors, and almost every home hadits own water supply from springs. An hour away on foot, the village of Haladin, another sizeable place of some 350 households surrounded by vineyards, housed an additional contingent of PUK fighters. '[The valley] was as important to the peshmerga as Baghdad is to the government,' was how one local trader put it.1  Hemmed in by steep mountains, this was a classic guerrilla stronghold protected by difficult terrain. But it had another strategic significance, too, for it lay just a few miles east of the vital Dukan Dam and hydroelectric power station at the head of the lake of the same name--an important source of electricity for the cities of Suleimaniyeh and Kirkuk.2 Seizing the Dukan Dam was a crucial element of the PUK's plan to liberate large expanses of Kurdistan on an accelerated timetable. The goal was to take the cities of Ranya, Koysinjaq and Qala Dizeh (see map on p.92), thus encircling the lake and establishing a new front line along the Haibat Sultan mountain range, between Koysinjaq and the western shore. But that plan, which was ready to be executed in February 1988, was not to be realized.  Since 1985, and the breakdown of negotations between the PUK and the Iraqi government, the entire Jafati valley had been 'redlined' as a 'prohibited area.' Attacks by aircraft and artillery occurred frequently, with shelling on an almost daily basis. But the PUK headquarters was well-defended, and all of the men and even some of the women in Sergalou, Yakhsamar and Haladin were organized into an armed self-defense force. Government checkpoints on the surrounding roads did a largely ineffective job of imposing the economic blockade.  The chemical weapons that had been used to such demoralizing effect against Iranian troops had also been brought into play repeatedly against the PUK redoubt during the previous summer. For an hour on the afternoon of June 8, 1987, chemical shells from a truck-mountedmultiple rocket-launcher, or rajima, rained down on Bergalou, Haladin and the nearby village of Sekaniyan ('Three Springs'). The rajima was a constant presence in the villagers' lives for many months after this, although the casualties appear to have been limited. One farmer told Middle East Watch that this was thanks in part to the high mountains, dense tree cover and natural shelters available, and in part to the notorious inaccuracy of the Iraqi gunners. The worst casualties were in Haladin, where one shell hit a house killing a man named Yasin Abd-al-Rahman and six members of his family. Otherwise, the main effects of the gas shelling were tearing and shortness of breath. Later chemical attacks produced additional symptoms, including blistering and burns. Those who died perished, in fits of shivering, within an hour of exposure to the chemicals; others acted as if deranged, and stumbled around laughing hysterically.3  The Iraqi Air Force also attacked the valley repeatedly. In the past, aerial harassment operations had been restricted to helicopters. But the Iranians had now supplied the PUK with anti-aircraft missiles that kept the Iraqi helicopters at bay, and fixed-wing aircraft were pressed into service. Sometimes the attacks were carried out by small Swiss-manufactured Pilatus planes, more commonly used as trainers or for crop-spraying. At other times, supersonic Soviet-made Sukhoi fighter-bombers took part, with as many as fifteen or twenty aircraft joining in the attacks. At first the raids used only conventional weapons, but on April 15, and again in July, the warplanes also dropped chemical bombs. Dispersed on the breeze, the main effect of the gas was temporary blindness, lasting two weeks or so. But it also killed a number of people, most of them civilians. By the summer of 1987, the peshmerga had supplies of gas masks, donated by the Iranians, and each division, or teep, had its own officer who was expert in defense against chemicals. But ordinary villagers had to defend themselves against the wind-borne gas as best they could, fleeing to higher ground, covering their faces with wet cloths as the Iranian-trained peshmerga doctors had instructed them, orsetting fires in the caves and underground shelters where they sought refuge.4  * * *   Throughout late January and February 1988, a flurry of intelligence reports from Amn Suleimaniyeh and the Iraqi Army's First Corps warned that new joint actions were being planned by the 'agents of Iran' (Umala Iran) and the Teheran regime. According to Amn, 'mercenaries' from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, operating out of PUK base camps, were 'carrying out surveillance missions in the direction of al-Ta'mim governorate'--in other words, westward, toward the Kirkuk oilfields. The PUK's first malband, based in Qara Dagh, was 'facilitating the entry of Khomeini's guards from the Darbandikhan sector.' On February 1, the Ba'ath Party branch in Qara Dagh informed Amn that 'the Iranian enemy plans to help the saboteurs' in attacking a number of targets--including the sizeable Kurdish town of Halabja. On February 8, a report from a secret informant briefed Amn on the enemy's state of preparedness. It noted that Jalal Talabani himself was out of the country. 'The number of saboteurs in Sergalou/Bergalou,' it continued, 'is between 600-800.'5  Despite its long history of living under attack, the PUK seems to have been unprepared for the ferocity of the attack that broke on it later that month. Perhaps the peshmerga had overestimated the degree to which the Iraqi regime was now psychologically tied down by the war against Iran. But they quickly understood its thinking in laying siege to the Jafati valley. Success there would not only decapitate the PUK; it would also prove, to devastating psychological effect, that the regime could prevail over the peshmerga wherever it chose, in any terrain.  At about 1:30 or 2:00 a.m. on February 23, the people of Yakhsamar, Sergalou and Bergalou awoke in the dark and rain to the thunderous sound of shelling from rajima. Although there is no definitive evidence that the Iraqi army was yet using the word 'Anfal' to describe its operations, these artillery shells may be considered to all intents and purposes the first shots fired in the Anfal campaign.6  It is evident that the regime attached a special significance to the new campaign right from the beginning. An Iraqi Defense Ministry order, for example, signed on February 23, passes on a Revolutionary Command Council decree that those who fall in the coming fight against the 'saboteurs' and the attendant campaign of village 'purification' are to be venerated as 'Martyrs of the Glorious Battle of Saddam's Qadissiyah'--that is to say, the war against Iran.7  At daybreak on February 23, government ground forces attacked from all directions. 'The army that laid siege to the headquarters was so big that it looked like a fence that was separating the area from the rest of Kurdistan,' recalled one peshmerga who was in Sergalou that day.8 The front line stretched for a full forty miles, from Bingird on the eastern side of the lake to Dukan, and thence to Suleimaniyeh and the towns of Mawat and Chwarta. The PUK held out for more than threeweeks, even though the assault involved army, air force and the elite Republican Guards, who were apparently employed only during the initial stages of Anfal.9 The armed forces' target was not just the PUK headquarters but all the villages in the valley, some 25-30 in all.10 According to other PUK sources, between 200 and 250 people were killed in the course of the siege, most of them active peshmerga. As long as the peshmerga resisted, most of the villagers hid out in nearby caves. But in the early days of March, the villages began to fall one by one as tanks and armored vehicles smashed through the PUK's defensive lines. The inhabitants fled, most in the direction of Iran. After they had departed, crews of army engineers moved in with bulldozers and razed their villages to the ground.  Enveloping the Jafati valley on three sides, the army did leave one escape route open--to the east and the Iranian frontier, twelve miles or so as the crow flies from Sergalou across the mountains. According to official intelligence reports, by February 25 the PUK had opened at least two rough roads to the border with Iranian assistance.11 At this stage, it appears that the government forces made no attempt to detain those who fled over the snow-covered mountains toward Iran. Mass disappearances had not yet become a matter of official policy.  Some survivors were offered an explicit choice by the army, backed up with a powerful warning: 'You are free to remain or leave,' one woman from Maluma village was told, 'but we will not be responsible if you choose to stay. You may be killed or become the victim ofchemicals.'12 This was no idle threat, for chemical weapons were used repeatedly during the First Anfal.  The majority of the armed peshmerga managed to withdraw in relatively good order, with ideas of redeploying their forces further to the south, in the broad hilly plain known as Germian. But they found their way blocked by government troops and were forced instead to circle northward to the fastness of Qandil mountain, on the Iran-Iraq border near Haj Omran. Others fled to the grasslands on the shores of Lake Dukan, where they defended themselves until they ran out of ammunition. The bedraggled survivors eventually ended up in Iran. Others still set up a new, temporary base camp in the village of Shanakhseh, until that too was hit with chemical weapons on about March 22.  That morning, Iraqi warplanes flew over and dropped balloons. Six aircraft returned at about 2:00 p.m. and dropped the bombs. 'The area was full of peshmerga and fleeing families,' said a PUK fighter who was there. 'There were thousands of people, many living in tents. I myself was injured, my face became black and my skin was painful. I had trouble breathing. But these were mild symptoms; others who were closer to the point of impact had severe blisters. Some men suffered from swollen testicles.' A PUK local commander believed that as many as twenty-eight people were killed and some 300 injured, mostly peshmerga families. (Other sources believe the figure may be somewhat lower.) Some of the dead were civilians, who were already exhausted from their attempt to cross the mountains into Iran.13  * * *   Given the intensity of this new campaign, which they would soon come to know by the name of Anfal, the peshmerga had realized that there was little they could do to protect the civilians, and they told them as much, advising the villagers that they would have to take their chances alone. At this point, with the PUK leadership still relatively intact and with frequent warnings being broadcast over the clandestine peshmergaradio station, civilians seem to have been given fair notice of the dangers they faced. This, together with the army's decision to leave an escape route, no doubt led to countless lives being saved. But by the time Anfal spread to other areas, it was much harder to give civilians any warning. After the siege of the PUK headquarters, the peshmerga began to grasp the direction that the campaign would take. But there was little or nothing they could do about it.  Most of the villagers from the Jafati valley survived. While some fled to the city of Suleimaniyeh, the majority headed for Iran, through the heavily mined no-man's-land along the border, in the first large-scale refugee exodus since the crushing of the Barzani-led revolt thirteen years earlier. But it was March, and the harsh Kurdish winter was not over.  'We left behind all the properties accumulated over fifty years,' added a middle-aged villager from Sergalou. 'The people moved like a panicked herd of cattle through the mountains in the direction of Iran. It was raining. There were warplanes overhead....Six people from Sergalou froze to death along the way, and another thirty from other villages in the same valley.'14  'The people were running, and lost their shoes,' said a 57-year old woman from the village of Qara Chatan. 'There was much snow. We were shivering from the cold.'15 People with children suffered especially in this way, since they could not move so quickly. The single most tragic incident involved a group of people who made it as far as Kanitou, a ruined village north of Sergalou that had been evacuated during the 1978 border clearances. Peshmerga from several parties were present in Kanitou, but they fell to bickering among themselves. In the chaos, a large band of fleeing villagers tried to cross the high snowpeaks into Iran. But they left too late in the day, and darkness overtook them when they were still several hours from safety. At least eighty died of cold and exposure; by one estimate, the number may have been as high as 160.16  Although the siege of the Jafati Valley was not accompanied by mass disappearances, some villagers from the First Anfal theater did vanish during late April, several weeks after Sergalou and Bergalou had fallen. One farmer from Haladin told Middle East Watch that after three days on the run, his family found refuge on the border, in tents supplied by sympathetic Iranian Kurds. 'They stayed there for one month,' he remembered. 'Then the army came to the border and arrested all these people, including my entire family. This was on April 20. The army dropped troops from helicopters. There was a bad snow, and people were exhausted.' The young man lost nine of his relatives that day. They included his mother, three sisters--two of them pregnant--and three nieces under the age of six. The witness escaped to Iran; only his father, a man in his late 50s, was ever seen alive again.17  Others who fled the siege of the PUK headquarters disappeared in a different manner. Three brothers from Sergalou recrossed the border into Iraq after two weeks in Iran, having heard false rumors of an amnesty for those who turned themselves in.18 They surrendered to the mustashar at a complex called Sengasar, outside the town of Qala Dizeh. But the man turned them over to the government, and they were never seen again. Similarly, a group of fifteen army deserters who had been hiding in the mountains for several weeks gave themselves up to the mustashar in the village of Chermaga. The mustashar had given the family of one his word of honor that no one would be harmed. But these young men, too, disappeared into the custody of Amn in Suleimaniyeh. These trick amnesties and broken promises would be repeated over and over again in the subsequent stages of the Anfal campaign.  * * *   The March 16 Chemical Attack on Halabja   For years, the hostility between Iran and Iraq had appeared to the Kurdish parties as a geopolitical loophole that they could exploit to their advantage. After withstanding the siege of Sergalou-Bergalou for two weeks, the PUK took the desperate decision to open a second front with Iranian military support. As their target the peshmerga chose Halabja, a town on the plain just a few miles from the border, in a feint that was designed to draw some of the Iraqi troops away from the siege of Sergalou and Bergalou. But the plan turned out to be a tragic miscalculation, as the once beneficial alliance with Iran turned into a crippling liability. For the Halabja diversion only cemented the view of the Iraqi regime that the war against Iran and the war against the Kurds was one and the same thing.  At the end of February, Iraq had stepped up its missile attacks on Teheran as part of the 'War of the Cities';19 the escalation was designed to push the weakened Iranians to the negotiating table on terms favorable to Baghdad. A confident senior official even admitted to Patrick Tyler of the Washington Post that Iraq was trying to lure its adversary into a trap by overextending its forces. 'For the first time in our history, we want the Iranians to attack,' the official said.20 At Halabja, the Iranians obliged.  Halabja was a bustling Kurdish town with a busy commercial section and a number of government offices. Villagers displaced from their homes by the war had swollen its population of 40,000 to 60,000 or more. The peshmerga had been strong here for almost thirty years, with several clandestine parties active--Socialists, Communists and others--inaddition to Jalal Talabani's PUK. One group with particular local strength was the pro-Iranian Islamic Movement Party (Bizutnaway Islami Eraqi). As a reprisal against local support for the peshmerga, Iraqi troops had already bulldozed two entire quarters of the town, Kani Ashqan and Mordana, in May 1987.21 Since about 1983, Iranian troops had been making secret reconnaissance visits to Halabja under cover of darkness. The town lay on the very edge of the war-zone, and dozens of small villages between Halabja and the Iranian border had been razed in the late 1970s, their inhabitants resettled in complexes on the edge of the city. But the greater strategic importance of Halabja was its location just seven miles east of Darbandikhan Lake, whose dam controls a significant part of the water supply to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.  During the first two weeks of March, a stream of Iraqi intelligence reports noted the buildup of Revolutionary Guards and peshmerga to the west of Halabja and the shelling of the nearby town of Sayed Sadeq by Iranian forces.22 On March 13, the Iranians officially announced that they had launched a new offensive named Zafar 7 in the Halabja area. According to Teheran radio, the offensive--conducted by a joint force of PUK peshmerga and pasdaran--was in retaliation for the Iraqi regime's recent chemical attacks on the Kurds.23 A second attack, apparently coordinated, followed the next day. This one was called Bait al-Maqdis 4, and the Iranians claimed that it had taken their forces within twelve miles of Suleimaniyeh. On March 16, Teheran announced yetanother offensive, codenamed Val-Fajr 10.24 Iran boasted that its forces had now advanced to the eastern shore of Darbandikhan Lake, controlling 800 square kilometers of Iraqi territory and 102 (presumably destroyed) villages. But the main thrust of Val-Fajr 10, Teheran declared, was the 'liberation' of the town of Halabja.  Halabja had been subjected to three days of heavy Iranian shelling from the surrounding hills, beginning on March 13. One by one, the small Iraqi military posts between Halabja and the border were routed, and their occupants pulled back to the safety of the town. Some stripped off their uniforms and took refuge in the mosques, while some took up temporary defensive positions in local army bases. Others fled altogether. Yet the Baghdad regime resisted the temptation to reinforce Halabja with large numbers of ground troops, for it had an entirely different strategy in mind.  Some Iranian pasdaran had reportedly begun to slip into town as early as March 13. By the night of March 15 they were openly parading through the streets, accompanied by Iraqi Kurds, greeting the townspeople and chanting 'God is Great! Khomeini is our leader!' They billeted themselves on local Kurdish families and ordered them to prepare dinner. Some rode around Halabja on motorcycles; others were very young, barely teenagers, and carried only sticks and knives. Many also carried gas masks. They asked bewildered people in the streets how far it was to the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.25 Militants of the Iraqi Islamic Movement did a victory dance outside the headquarters of Amn and the Istikhbarat building, which they took over for themselves. But among the townspeople as a whole there was grave apprehension, especially when public employees were ordered on March 15 to evacuatetheir posts.26 Swift Iraqi reprisals were widely expected; one Amn cable the next day spoke, with notable understatement, of the need for 'a firm escalation of military might and cruelty.'27  The Iraqi counterattack began in the mid-morning of March 16, with conventional airstrikes and artillery shelling from the town of Sayed Sadeq to the north. Most families in Halabja had built primitive air-raid shelters near their homes. Some crowded into these, others into the government shelters, following the standard air-raid drills they had been taught since the beginning of the Iran-Iraq War in 1980. The first wave of air strikes appears to have included the use of napalm or phosphorus. 'It was different from the other bombs,' according to one witness. 'There was a huge sound, a huge flame and it had very destructive ability. If you touched one part of your body that had been burned, your hand burned also. It caused things to catch fire.' The raids continued unabated for several hours. 'It was not just one raid, so you could stop and breathe before another raid started. It was just continuous planes, coming and coming. Six planes would finish and another six would come.'28  Those outside in the streets could see clearly that these were Iraqi, not Iranian aircraft, since they flew low enough for their markings to be legible. In the afternoon, at about 3:00, those who remained in the shelters became aware of an unusual smell. Like the villagers in the Balisan Valley the previous spring, they compared it most often to sweet apples, or to perfume, or cucumbers, although one man says that it smelled 'very bad, like snake poison.' No one needed to be told what the smell was.  The attack appeared to be concentrated in the northern sector of the city, well away from its military bases--although these, by now, had been abandoned. In the shelters, there was immediate panic and claustrophobia. Some tried to plug the cracks around the entrance with damp towels, or pressed wet cloths to their faces, or set fires. But in the end they had no alternative but to emerge into the streets. It wasgrowing dark and there were no streetlights; the power had been knocked out the day before by artillery fire. In the dim light, the people of Halabja could see nightmarish scenes. Dead bodies--human and animal--littered the streets, huddled in doorways, slumped over the steering wheels of their cars. Survivors stumbled around, laughing hysterically, before collapsing. Iranian soldiers flitted through the darkened streets, dressed in protective clothing, their faces concealed by gas masks. Those who fled could barely see, and felt a sensation 'like needles in the eyes.' Their urine was streaked with blood.29  Those who had the strength fled toward the Iranian border. A freezing rain had turned the ground to mud, and many of the refugees went barefoot. Those who had been directly exposed to the gas found that their symptoms worsened as the night wore on. Many children died along the way and were abandoned where they fell. At first light the next morning Iraqi warplanes appeared in the sky, apparently monitoring the flight of the survivors. Many kept away from the main roads and scattered into the mountains, despite the ever-present menace of landmines. According to one account, some six thousand people from Halabja congregated at the ruined villages of Lima and Pega. Another thousand or so gathered among the rubble of Daratfeh, the last village on the Iraqi side of the border.30  The Iranians were ready for the influx of refugees. Iranian helicopters arrived at Lima and Pega in the late afternoon and military doctors administered atropine injections to the survivors before they were ferried across the border. In Iran, all agree that they were well-cared for, although some had injuries that were untreatable, and they died on Iranian soil. The sickest were transferred to hospitals in the Iranian cities of Teheran and Kermanshah, and the smaller town of Paveh. The remainder spent two weeks in a converted schoolhouse in the town of Hersin, where they received medical attention. From there, they were taken to two refugee camps--one at Sanghour, on the Persian Gulf nearBandar Abbas, the other at Kamiaran in Kermanshah province, close to the Iraqi border. There they waited until Anfal was over, and they believed that it was safe to return home.  There would, however, be no homes to return to, for virtually every structure in Halabja was leveled with dynamite and bulldozers after Iraqi forces finally retook the city. So, too, were Zamaqi and Anab, two complexes that had been built on the outskirts of Halabja in the late 1970s to rehouse villagers from the destroyed border areas. So, too, was nearby Sayed Sadeq, a town of some 20,000. In both Halabja and Sayed Sadeq, the electrical substations were also dynamited.31 Even after the razing of Halabja, many bodies remained in the streets to rot where they had fallen four months earlier.32  'The loss of Halabja is a regrettable thing,' remarked Foreign Minister and Revolutionary Command Council member Tariq Aziz, adding, 'Members of Jalal al-Talabani's group are in the area and these traitors collaborate with the Iranian enemy.'33 As the news of Halabja spread throughout Iraq, those who asked were told by Ba'athist officials that Iran had been responsible. A Kurdish student of English at Mosul University recalled his shock and disbelief at the news; he and his fellow Kurds were convinced that Iraqi government forces had carried out the attack, but dared not protest for fear of arrest.34  Not until July did the Iraqi regime move to recover Halabja, which was left under de facto Iranian control. In the days following the mass gassing, the Iranian government, well aware of the implications, ferried in journalists from Teheran, including a number of foreigners. Their photographs, mainly of women, children and elderly people huddled inertly in the streets, or lying on their backs with mouths agape, circulated widely, demonstrating eloquently that the great mass of the dead had been Kurdish civilian non-combatants. Yet the numbers have remained elusive, with most reports continuing to cite Kurdish or Iranian estimates of at least 4,000 and as many as 7,000.35 The true figure was certainly in excess of 3,200, which was the total number of individual names collected in the course of systematic interviews with survivors.36  * * *   The Fall of the PUK Headquarters   Halabja was a symbolic show of Iraqi force in a war that Iran could never win. But the mass gassing had also served a more important purpose by delivering a crushing psychological blow to the Kurdish peshmerga and their civilian sympathizers. Halabja was exemplary collective punishment of the most brutal kind, carried out in bald defiance of all international prohibitions on the use of chemical weapons. The PUK fighters had been exposed to poison gas several times during the preceding weeks; now the will of the civilian population was to be broken.  The Halabja chemical attack was a harbinger of later Anfal policies. During each of the eight phases of the military campaign, these forbidden weapons would be used against Kurdish villages, dozens of them in all--enough to terrify their residents with a reminder of what had befallen Halabja. Yet Halabja, while remaining the single greatest atrocity of the war against the Kurds, was not part of Anfal. In that sense, it was the clearest possible illustration of the bureaucratic logic of the Anfal campaign. On March 15, the very eve of the Halabja attack, the Northern Bureau Command ordered that 'the families of subversives who take refuge with our units should be detained in special guarded camps set up for that purpose under the supervision of intelligence officers from the First and Fifth Army Corps.'37 These camps were the first step in establishing the web-like bureaucracy of mass killing that operated during Anfal. But the fleeing survivors of Halabja were not detained and taken to the camps, because the Iraqi regime did not consider Halabja to be a part of Anfal. The reason was quite simple: Halabja was a city, and Anfal was intended to deal with the rural Kurdish population.38  * * *   After Halabja, the PUK headquarters did not resist for long. At 10:10 on the night of March 18, army units stormed into Sergalou causing heavy losses among its final defenders. Bergalou fell the following afternoon. Saddam Hussein had fulfilled his promise to cut off 'the head of the snake.' By the end of the day, the General Command of the Iraqi Armed Forces had prepared its official victory declaration,and a jubilant announcer on Iraqi radio informed his listeners that 'thousands of the sons of our Kurdish people took to the streets of Erbil, expressing their joy and chanting in support of President Saddam Hussein.'39 The army communique contains the first official reference that Middle East Watch has been able to find to the operation known as Anfal. The successful conclusion of each subsequent phase of the campaign would be announced in the Iraqi press with similar fanfare.  The March 19 communique reads:  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Like all covetous invaders, the Zionist Khomeinyite forces relied on some of those who betrayed the homeland and people in the northern area of Iraq--those who our good Kurdish people expelled from their ranks. Those elements performed shameful services for foreigners. Among their shameful acts was facilitating the missions of the invading forces in entering in the Halabja border villages in the Suleimaniyeh Governorate.  As an expression of the will of the great Iraqi people, the brave Armed Forces, and the good honorable nationalists from our Kurdish people; and in response to the treason of this stray clique; the brave Badr forces, the brave Al-Qa'qa forces, the brave Al-Mu'tasim forces, and the forces affiliated with them from our Armed Forces and the National Defense Battalions [jahsh], carried out the Anfal operation under the supervision of Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashem, who is temporarily assigned to this mission in addition to his regular duties.40 Our forces attackedthe headquarters of the rebellion led by traitor Jalal Talabani, the agent to the Iranian regime, the enemy of the Arabs and Kurds, in the Sergalou, Bergalou and Zewa areas and in the rough mountainous areas in Suleimaniyeh. At 1300 today, after a brave and avenging battle with the traitors, the headquarters of the rebellion was occupied. The commander of the force guarding the rebellion headquarters, and a number of traitors and misguided elements, were captured with God's help and with the determination of the zealous men of Iraq--Arabs and Kurds. Many were killed and others escaped in shame.  This is unique bravery and faithfulness. This is a struggle admired by the entire world, the struggle of leader Saddam Hussein's people, Arabs and Kurds, who placed themselves in the service of the homeland and gave their love and faithfulness to their great leader, the symbol of their victory and title of their prosperity. Our people have rejected from their ranks all traitors who sold themselves cheaply to the covetous foreign enemy.  Praise be to God for His victory. Shame to the ignominious.  [signed] The Armed Forces General Command, 19 March 1988'41  ______   1 Middle East Watch interview with former Haladin resident Hakim Mahmoud Ahmad, Piramagroun complex, July 27, 1992.  2 The PUK, together with the Iraqi Communist Party, the Socialist Party of Kurdistan and a number of Iranian parties, had formerly been based in Nawzeng, the 'Valley of the Parties,' some distance to the north. See Van Bruinessen, Agha, Shaikh and State, p.39. But they were driven out in 1983, when the Iranian army attacked and the Iraqis moved in to retake the area. The Jafati valley housed contingents of the Iranian KDP and Komala parties, in addition to the PUK.  3 Again, these symptoms suggest that a nerve agent such as Sarin was used here.  4 Confirmation of the Iraqi regime's intent to use chemical weapons, and of the fact that the peshmerga had obtained gas masks, is contained in a document in the captured Iraqi archives. Classified 'urgent and secret,' it is a telegram from Major Sa'di Mahmoud Hussein, Commander of Zakho District, dated 22/6 (year omitted, but from the context almost certainly 1987), reference no. AS/3/4181 and addressed to 'Commander (A)'. It reads:  '[With reference to] letter of the command of the 38th Force Secret and Urgent 14665 on 20/6, we have learned the following: 4,000 gas masks arrived at the First Branch of the descendants of treason [i.e. the KDP] to guard themselves against poison gas and the saboteurs will wear them when we use chemical materials to attack their concentrations. Please check the accuracy of this information and take all necessary measures.'   5 These notes are drawn from a lengthy series of secret cables on conditions in the Sergalou and Qara Dagh areas that were sent to the Security Directorate of the Autonomous Region from Amn Suleimaniyeh. The cables are dated from January 25 to March 19, 1988.  6 Middle East Watch was given various dates for the opening of the Sergalou campaign, ranging from February 22 to 26, 1988; from the Defense Ministry order cited here, it seems apparent that the correct date is February 23. In field interviews, both peshmerga combatants and ordinary villagers could differ wildly in their recollection of dates, even for crucially important events.  7 Defense Ministry Legal Department circular to Interior Ministry,  no. Q2/236/6300, dated February 23, 1988.  8 Middle East Watch interview, Goktapa, June 2, 1992.  9 The Republican Guard began life as a politically reliable paramilitary force, made up of three brigades from President Saddam Hussein's Tikrit district. Over time it expanded into a heavily mechanized élite corps, twenty-five divisions strong. It is easy to recognize Republican Guard troops in the field because of their camouflage uniforms and their distinctive red triangular shoulder-patches.  10 This figure was given to us by Aras Talabani, a senior PUK official and nephew of party leader Jalal Talabani.

However, it was vital for citizens to know whether they were dealing with a genuine amnesty announced through official channels. The rumor of an amnesty could have devastating effects; fleeing civilians and peshmerga were often lured into government traps during the Anfal campaign by spurious offers of amnesty, local as well as general. Not until September 6, and the completion of the military campaign, was a genuine amnesty offered. See below, chapter 11.  19 Jupa and Dingeman (op. cit., pp. 5-6) believe that Iraq fired as many as 182 enhanced-range SCUD-B missiles in a 52-day assault, starting February 29, 1988. Developed with the help of East German and Brazilian engineers, these 'souped-up' Scuds were capable of reaching the Iranian capital, 340 miles from the Iraqi border.  20 According to this report, 'The official explained that Iraq's confidence that it could repel a major offensive would demonstrate to Iraq's allies that Iran had no hope of breaching the country's defenses. Moreover, the world would be reminded, he said, that the war is a volatile flashpoint requiring a major diplomatic effort to bring it to an end.' Washington Post, March 2, 1988.  21 On the razing of the Kani Ashqan neighborhood, see the document cited at pp.78-79 above.  22 Secret cable traffic from Amn Suleimaniyeh to Autonomous Region Amn headquarters, March 6-16, 1988.  23 The two parties to the Halabja feint give differing accounts of the relative strength of the forces involved. While Iran played up its own participation, PUK sources interviewed by Middle East Watch claimed that the seizure of Halabja was a joint peshmerga operation, which the Iranians only joined in large numbers after the March 16 chemical attack. Neither version can be regarded as wholly reliable.  24 Among the many Iranian offensives of the war, the designation of Val-Fajr carried special weight. Val-Fajr I, in February 1983, was Iran's first land assault on Iraqi territory; Val-Fajr 8 and 9, in February 1986, resulted in the seizure of the Fao Peninsula and the simultaneous occupation of mountain areas near Suleimaniyeh, bringing Iranian forces close enough to shell that city. See Cordesman and Wagner, op. cit., pp.159, 219-224.  25 Both cities contain important Shi'a shrines: Najaf is the burial place of the Imam Ali, and Karbala of the Imam al-Husayn. The question asked by the pasdaran says something about their naivete. Both cities are situated well to the south of Baghdad--several hundred miles, that is to say, from Halabja.  26 Middle East Watch interview with former municipal employee, Halabja, May 8, 1992.  27 Secret Amn cable, unnumbered, to Autonomous Region Amn headquarters, March 16, 1988.  28 Middle East Watch interview, Halabja, May 17, 1992.  29 The symptoms described by survivors are consistent with exposure to both mustard gas and a nerve agent such as Sarin.  30 Resool lists these villages among those destroyed in the border clearances of 1978. Daratfeh appears as a village of thirty households in the nahya of Biyara; Lima and Pega, hamlets of eight and twelve houses respectively, are in the nahya of Sirwan.  31 This reportedly occurred in every one of the nahyas and qadhas that were demolished during the campaigns of 1987-1989. By way of comparison, see Middle East Watch's analysis of the targeting of Iraq's electrical system during the 1991 Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm), in Needless Deaths in the Gulf War: Civilian Casualties during the Air Campaign and Violations of the Laws of War, pp.171-193. In Halabja and Sayed Sadeq, of course, the evident intent was to make the towns uninhabitable. Both were subsequently declared part of a 'prohibited area.'  32 The Iranian forces in Halabja had managed to bury an estimated 3,000 victims of the March 16 chemical attack in mass graves under a thin layer of dirt in the complex of Anab. Four years later, the corpses were still there, and they were beginning to pollute the local groundwater.  33 Amman Sawt al-Sha'b in Arabic, March 25, 1988, in FBIS, March 25, 1988.  34 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 20, 1992.  35 See for example Time, 'The Cries of the Kurds,' September 19, 1988 and The Washington Post, 'Rebel Kurds Say They Are Ready to Strike at Iraq,' January 24, 1991, both of which cite the figure of 4,000; Kendal Nezan, 'Saddam's Other Victims--the Kurds,' The Washington Post, January 20, 1991 (5,000); Isabel O'Keeffe, 'Flanders Fields Revisited,' New Statesman and Society, March 1989 (5,500); 'Massacre by Gas,' in The Kurds: A Minority Rights Group Profile, 1990 (6,000); and The Observer, 'Hitler-Style Genocide Threatens the Kurds,' May 7, 1989 (7,000).  36 This figure was collected by the Kurdish researcher Shorsh Resool.  37 Letter no. 297 of the Northern Bureau Command, dated March 15, 1988. These instructions were conveyed to Suleimaniyeh Amn (Chamchamal, Sayed Sadeq and Darbandikhan) in an unnumbered letter from Eastern Region Military Intelligence (Istikhbarat), dated March 18 and classified 'confidential and personal.'  38 By the same logic of Anfal--perverse yet utterly consistent--villagers from the Halabja region who returned to their homes in the 'prohibited areas' after the chemical attack were later 'Anfalized.' Thus, twenty families who were found by Iraqi troops in the village of Tawella (nahya of Biyara) when the army retook this area in July 1988 were all reportedly arrested and disappeared.

The first of them is of course named for the Battle of Badr in A.D. 624, which is the subject of the Koranic sura of al-Anfal. Lt. Gen.

Norman Schwarzkopf.  41 Baghdad Voice of the Masses in Arabic, March 19, 1988, in FBIS, March 21, 1988, pp.22-23.     4   Second Anfal--Qara Dagh, March 22-April 1, 1988 'Bring your families; nothing will happen to them.'  -- army officer to villagers fleeing from southern Qara Dagh.  Although the siege of Sergalou-Bergalou consumed enormous resources, the Iraqi armed forces were not so rash as to neglect other targets. To block any attempt by the PUK to reinforce its beleaguered national headquarters, the regime maintained a steady rhythm of attacks against the other regional commands, such as the first malband, based on Qopi mountain in Qara Dagh and charged with all operations in the governorate of Suleimaniyeh. At each stage of Anfal, as the main assault changed its geographical focus, this pattern of secondary pressure was maintained.  Few parts of Iraqi Kurdistan are as lovely as Qara Dagh. Its chain of jagged, serrated peaks runs southeast for some seventy miles, as straight as a razor's edge. But the features of its beauty were also those that made Qara Dagh vulnerable. It took three weeks for elements of twenty-seven army divisions together with Kurdish jahsh to crush resistance in the Jafati Valley, which is hemmed in by steep mountains. But Qara Dagh was the opposite: a thin line of mountains flanked by almost indefensible lowlands. To the west lies the hilly plain of Germian, the 'warm country.' To the east, until 1988, dozens of small farming villages nestled in green valleys of astonishing fertility. Fields of winter wheat, barley, tobacco and rice flourished next to rich plots of okra, peas, green beans, tomatoes, melons and grapes. At the southernmost tip of the Qara Dagh chain lay the 6,000-foot sentinel of Zerda Mountain, a peshmerga stronghold. Beyond this, to the east, a narrow corridor carried the highway from Suleimaniyeh past the town of Darbandikhan and the lake of the same name, with its strategic dam. Even as the First Anfal raged to the north, Iraqi intelligence kept a watchful eye on the lake, ever fearful of a waterborne attack by Iranian forces on the dam and its power station.  The government had relinquished control of rural Qara Dagh since the early days of the Iran-Iraq War. In 1987, the nahya itself was emptied, and its population relocated to the nearby complexes of Naser and Zarayen. Troops and jahsh took over the deserted town, but they were quickly routed from their positions by the peshmerga. Retaliatory air-raids soon destroyed what was left of Qara Dagh, although PUK forces continued to control the rubble. Like the civilian population of the surrounding villages, they learned to live with constant artillery shelling from a half-dozen government firebases between Suleimaniyeh and Darbandikhan.  Since 1983 the twin hubs of peshmerga activity in Qara Dagh had been the villages of Takiyeh and Balagjar, which housed armed contingents of the Iraqi Communist Party as well as the PUK. A dirt path linked these two villages, which lay less than two miles apart. The district center of Qara Dagh--the nahya--was some three hours distant on foot; three miles off to the east was the large village of Sayw Senan, where the peshmerga had installed a field hospital that serviced much of the surrounding population.  During the early months of 1988, Iraqi intelligence cables were filled with references to Iranian pasdaran moving freely in and out of the Qara Dagh peshmerga camps. A force of Revolutionary Guards, 200-strong, was reported to be present in Balagjar on January 25; by March 6, their number had risen to 400.1 Eighty members of 'the imposter Khomeini's guard' were said to be in Sayw Senan on March 9, and they were heavily armed.  Sometime in February--the exact date is unclear--eight Iraqi aircraft carried out a chemical attack on Takiyeh and Balagjar. 'Many bombs were dropped,' said Omar, a Takiyeh man who witnessed the raid. 'I don't know how many, maybe eight or nine. When they fell, there was a loud explosion, a little smoke, and it was like salt spread on the ground. People who touched it ended up with blisters on their skin. Animals that ate the affected grass died instantly.' But there were no human fatalities; because of the daily attacks, all the Takiyeh villagers had fled totemporary shelters in the fields. 'But in Balagjar, many of the pasdaran and PUK peshmerga, and many other people too, lost their sight for three days; the pasdaran moved out of Balagjar three or four days before the Qara Dagh Anfal began.'2  The continual chemical attacks during the First Anfal, and now on Qara Dagh, seem to have had the effect that the Iraqi government intended. An Amn intelligence report dated March 16, the day of the Halabja massacre, noted that a dozen divisions (teep) of the PUK had dispersed from their bases throughout southern Iraqi Kurdistan during the previous few days in fear of further chemical attacks. Another cable the next day reported, 'We have learned from our reliable secret sources that a few days ago the treacherous Al-Hasek group [the Kurdistan Socialist Party] took possession of an estimated 1500 protective gas masks. They received these from the Zionist-Iranian regime.'3  These precautions, however, were of little help, for Anfal came to Qara Dagh on March 22 with one of the most lethal chemical attacks of the entire campaign, on the village of Sayw Senan. It was the day after Nowroz, the Kurdish New Year and the first day of spring, which the peshmerga had celebrated by lighting bonfires and discharging their gunsinto the air.4 Despite the news of the attacks on Sergalou-Bergalou and Halabja, and despite the recently reported presence of Iranian pasdaran in their village, the people of Sayw Senan seemed to have a curious and ill-founded sense of their own immunity. 'People were saying, 'It will be the same as in the past. They will attack us and we will defeat them,' recalled one villager.5 Although Sayw Senan was home to a PUK division (teep), there were very few peshmerga in the village by this time; most had been summoned to the defense of Sergalou-Bergalou. But at the dinner hour on March 22, the villagers heard the whistling sound of shells fired from a rajima and smelled the odor of apples. One shell landed in the courtyard of a house, instantly killing thirteen of the fourteen people in the family of a man called Mahdi Hadi Zorab. Only one son, a peshmerga, survived by fleeing to the mountains. Six separate estimates given to Middle East Watch by local villagers and PUK officials place the total number of dead in the chemical attack on Sayw Senan at between seventy-eight and eighty-seven.  'When we received the news of the attack from people fleeing it, many men from our village went to Sayw Senan to help,' said Omar, the farmer from Takiyeh. 'We saw the bodies of those who had died inside the village. I helped bury sixty-seven with my own hands in Koshk village after we took them there on tractors. We laid them all in one big grave in the Haji Raqa graveyard, with their clothes on. Another fourteen bodies were buried in Asteli Serru village. They had died instantly. They were bleeding from the nose; it was as if their brains had exploded.'  The following day, March 23, the chemical rajima hit Dukan, another PUK base in a village of seventy houses.6 On the night of the 24th it targeted Ja'faran, a farming village of 200 houses which had no PUK presence, but housed the small headquarters that controlled KDP operations in the governorate of Kirkuk. According to two villagers, this was not the first time that Ja'faran had been attacked with gas. In May 1987, MIG fighter planes had dropped chemicals on the outskirts of the village--one man counted fourteen bombs, which produced red, green and white smoke. Ja'faran was lucky, for neither of the chemical attacks killed anyone--even though hundreds of farm animals perished. The May 1987 bombing took place when most people were outside the village, and peshmerga paramedics from a nearby base provided emergency medical care.7 The first attack scared people enough that they rarely returned to their homes, and even slept in temporary shelters in the fields. The March 1988 rajima attack found the village deserted.  * * *   The Exodus from Qara Dagh   By now the hillsides were alive with people fleeing Anfal, for the army's ground assault had begun on the afternoon of March 23. Troops from the army's 43rd Division, backed by jahsh and Amn Emergency Forces, converged from four directions on the area between Qara Dagh and Darbandikhan, driving the villagers from their homes like beaters flushing out game-birds.8 The general sense of panic was enhanced bythe news, carried by word of mouth and over the peshmerga field radios, of the devastating poison gas attack on Sayw Senan.  The mass exodus was mainly to the north, where people hoped to find sanctuary in Suleimaniyeh or in one of the complexes along the main highway. One group of villagers from Chami Smor smelled the nauseating odor of rotten apples, carried on the wind that was blowing from the direction of Ja'faran. Another family, from the village of Masoyi, took refuge in a cave a few minutes walk from their homes. But they made the mistake of leaving a lantern burning when they fell asleep. In the night they were awakened by the throb of helicopters, which had evidently been attracted by the light, and the sound of explosions. Suddenly the cave was filled with the suffocating smell of sweet melons. The family stumbled outside and fled, carrying two children who had been overcome by the fumes. By good fortune they survived, and hid out on the slopes of Zerda mountain. Three days later they watched as the army burned the village of Masoyi.9  What the regime intended to do with civilians caught up in the Second Anfal remains murky. By now, Istikhbarat had received orders from the Northern Bureau to set up special temporary camps to house those who were displaced. But the roundups during the last week of March were much less systematic than in the later phases of the Anfal operation. Between Qara Dagh and Suleimaniyeh, one physical obstacle loomed before the fleeing villagers--the 4,300-foot Glazerda Mountain. They found its slopes swarming with troops, jahsh, commandos in camouflage uniforms and members of the Emergency Forces (Quwat Taware'). Everywhere there were ragged people, tractor-drawn carts and farm animals. Helicopters hovered overhead. There was tank and artillery fire from every side: 'It was like a boiling pot,' said a man from Ja'faran who survived.  Yet the army's attitude was ambiguous. In the first few days of the Second Anfal, some villagers were told to make their own way to the city and the complexes (although Amn later carried out house-to-house searches of Naser, Zarayen and Suleimaniyeh to track these people down.) Others fled via back trails into the mountains as soon as they saw the soldiers, and eluded the dragnet that way. Word of the Qara Dagh exodus reached Suleimaniyeh, and the city relatives of some families made their way to Glazerda Mountain to fetch them.  Despite the massive military presence, the survivors of the Sayw Senan attack heard rumors of a temporary amnesty, and remained on the mountainside unmolested for several days in the rain. But on the fifth day soldiers at the checkpoint on the Qara Dagh-Suleimaniyeh road began to arrest them. Some, especially the elderly and the infirm, were helped to escape by the jahsh, in an early hint of the contradictory role that the Kurdish militia would play throughout Anfal. But between twenty-five and thirty people from Sayw Senan were taken away at this point and never seen again.  The attitude of the troops seems to have changed with an incident that was witnessed by Omar, the farmer from Takiyeh village:  When we arrived, the army had not yet started arresting people. The officers were just asking us if there were saboteurs in our area, and we told them that there were. But then something happened. A tractor cart laden with old wheat grain was blocking the road because it had a flat tire. The owner had abandoned it there. So a tank came and tried to move the cart out of the way. Instead, it overturned it completely and a lot of Kalashnikovs came tumbling out from underneath the grain, enough to arm a whole squad. Then the army put out a radio call to units in different areas to set up roadblocks, and they started to arrest people--men, women, children, even the people who had come from Suleimaniyeh.  I was twenty meters away from the tank, behind the army lines. There were 500 of us. We fled into the mountains--it was the jahsh who told us to run if we were able to.... My brother Khaled was still behind the tractor cart when the incident occurred. We were close to one another, close enough to call out to each other. But he was arrested and taken to Suleimaniyeh.10  Khaled was never seen again; nor were three other young men from Takiyeh who were arrested with him. Omar escaped to the city and survived.  Those who were arrested at the checkpoint were loaded into military IFA trucks and driven to the Emergency Forces base in the Chwar Bagh ('Four Orchards') quarter of Suleimaniyeh. There were thousands of prisoners there from the Qara Dagh region, and every day hundreds more arrived. The soldiers recorded their names and confiscated whatever valuables and identity documents they were carrying. One man from the village of Dolani Khwaru described being held at first on a nearby military base, supervised by Istikhbarat officers, before being transferred to the Emergency Forces headquarters.11  There the prisoners remained for as long as three or four weeks. Some groups of young men were blindfolded and separated from the rest, while others were taken out for a couple of days but later returned to their cells. The detainees were given almost nothing to eat, although it was possible to buy food from the guards. Although it was the army that had detained them, the villagers who passed through the Taware' base said that the daily interrogation sessions were conducted by Amn agents. 'Are your sons peshmerga?,' they were asked; 'What peshmerga activity is there in your village?' The interrogators appeared to regard even children of grade-school age as potential 'saboteurs.' After an average of two or three weeks, buses and coasters arrived to take the detainees away. They drove off west, in the direction of Kirkuk.  Middle East Watch interviewed survivors from some ten Qara Dagh villages affected by the Second Anfal. In every case, they could name the young men of draft age who had disappeared after detention in the Suleimaniyeh Emergency Forces base. From Serko, nine never came back; four were lost from Takiyeh and another four from nearby Balagjar; two from Berday, three from Koshk, two from Dolani Khwaru, three from Deiwana, nine from Mitsa Chweir, five from Chami Smor. Repeated across the whole nahya of Qara Dagh, with its eighty villages, one may reasonably assume that several hundred young men disappeared during the Second Anfal.  But the story is more complex than this, as the experience of villages like Chami Smor suggests. The five young men of Chami Smor who vanished from Suleimaniyeh were army deserters who gave themselves up to the authorities as part of the general exodus. However, the village's location--at the very edge of the high Qara Dagh mountains--tempted others into what proved to be a terrible mistake. While themajority fled north, two families struck out across the forbidding peaks toward the Germian plain, hoping to be safe in the town of Kalar, which would not be touched by Anfal. There were seventeen people in the group altogether--men, women and children. None of them ever reached their destination. Nor did hundreds of others who fled south with the same idea. It must be presumed that they were all seized by the Iraqi authorities.12  * * *   Flight to Southern Germian   There are very striking regional differences in the pattern of mass disappearances during the Anfal campaign. After the First Anfal, adult men and teenage boys who were captured by the army were disappeared--a pattern that was repeated in all areas. But in several places, notably southern Germian, huge numbers of women and children were also taken away and never seen again. The criteria for this selection seem to have included not only one's place of birth but the area in which one was captured. In many cases, but not all, the pattern of disappearances appears to have reflected the degree of resistance that the troops encountered. If the peshmerga fought back strongly, women and children captured in the vicinity were more likely to be disappeared along with their husbands and fathers. This may be what is implied in an Amn letter, dated August 2, 1988, which requests information on whether those who had been given into its custody had surrendered in an area where combat had taken place.13  Women and children who fled north from Qara Dagh toward Suleimaniyeh and the complexes were not harmed. Those who crossed into southern Germian vanished. Two men, three women and six children disappeared from the village of Aliawa. Forty-seven villagersfrom Masoyi, including many children and nursing infants, were captured near Kalar and never seen again.14  The population of Omer Qala, a village of twenty houses at the southern tip of Zerda Mountain, had fled en masse on hearing of the gas attack on nearby Sayw Senan. Taking with them only a few essentials such as money and blankets, as well as their animal herds, they skirted the mountain and headed southwest in the direction of Germian. Although they were not peshmerga, all the men carried weapons, as is common practice among Iraqi Kurdish males; all but three of them were either army deserters or draft dodgers. The twenty families walked for several days, sleeping in caves or in the open air. They hoped to return to their homes when the government was driven out of their area, as had always happened in the past. But this time was different. Reaching the village of Bakr Bayef on the eastern edge of Germian, they learned that the whole Qara Dagh area had fallen to government forces. All of their villages had been razed to the ground; there were no homes to return to. Behind them, the army's chemical shells rained down on Zerda Mountain, and in the early morning of April 1 the army captured the crucial peshmerga villages of Takiyeh and Balagjar.15  Far from outrunning the army, the people of Omer Qala had run straight into the jaws of the enemy. Germian was the next target of Anfal, the villagers of Bakr Bayef told them, and its inhabitants had been given seventy-two hours to surrender. The twenty families gathered that night to decide on their next move. They concluded that there was no alternative but to surrender. After all, the more optimistic among them reasoned, walking toward government lines had offered protection in previous rounds of fighting between the army and the peshmerga. In the morning they headed in the direction of the government forces, as far as the village of Boysana. Less than a mile further on lay a place calledSheikh Tawil, which was to become perhaps the single most stubbornly defended target in the entire Anfal campaign.  In the course of the last week of March, the people of Sheikh Tawil, who belonged to the Tarkhani tribe, had offered refuge to hundreds of fellow Kurds fleeing from Qara Dagh. Although they were from different tribes, said one man, 'We sheltered them; we became one.'16 In the wake of the panicked civilians came a fresh contingent of peshmerga, fleeing their rout on Zerda Mountain. The triangle between the mountain, Sheikh Tawil and Darbandikhan was by now a raging cauldron. There was constant shelling from all directions, some of it Iraqi and some from the Iranian side. No one could any longer tell the difference. Confusion reigned. From April 3 to 5, the army and the peshmerga fought their first, inconclusive battle for control of Sheikh Tawil. In the general chaos that preceded the fighting, most of the civilians of Sheikh Tawil evacuated their homes and made for the highway that runs southwest from Darbandikhan Lake to Kalar. Seventy-nine of them would be captured and disappeared.  But this was not yet the Third Anfal, the Germian Anfal: the horror of that was still to come.  The Omer Qala families watched as four old men of Boysana went forward to meet the troops, carrying white flags. 'Bring your families,' they were told. 'Nothing will happen to them.' Trusting the officer's promise, a number of men, women and children turned themselves in. They were promptly arrested. Those who remained behind later learned that they had been taken to the army brigade headquarters in the town of Kalar. But that was the last that was ever heard of them.  The remaining Omer Qala villagers fled once more, walking until they reached the town of La'likhan on the main road. They found a huge crowd of people from many different villages milling around, and a large fleet of trucks which the army had brought to collect them. Again the villagers conferred. Despite their terror, they again agreed that surrender was their only hope. Akram, an eighteen-year old from Omer Qala, was still suspicious, however. Fearing punishment as a draft dodger, he hid himself in an empty barrel to observe the mass surrender. Five hundred gave themselves up; only twenty, including Akram, stayed behind. Akram survived; the five hundred disappeared.17  ______   1 From a sequence of secret cables from Amn Suleimaniyeh to Amn Autonomous Region headquarters; no. 1754 of January 25, 1988; no. 5474 of March 6, 1988; and no. 5860 of March 9, 1988.

Middle East Watch interview, Bayinjan complex, March 21, 1993. PUK officials deny, however, that any HAWKs were present inside Iraq and say that they had only SAM-7s. They also claim that the main function of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards was to conduct reconnaissance and intelligence missions.  3 Amn Suleimaniyeh to Amn Autonomous Region headquarters, cables no. 6631 of March 16, 1988 and no. 6739 of March 17, 1988. Despite the dates, from other references in these documents to pasdaran activities in and around Halabja it is apparent that both reports were prepared by agents who were unaware of the March 16 chemical attack.  4 While a second witness gave the date of the Sayw Senan attack as March 18, the later date seems more credible, since the witness specifically referred to Nowroz falling on the previous day. All dates given by witnesses need to be treated with a certain amount of caution: although the Kurds use a 365-day solar calendar, the months do not correspond precisely to those of the Gregorian calendar. On the Kurdish calender and the traditional celebration of Nowroz, see Izady, The Kurds, pp. 241-243.  5 Middle East Watch interview, Naser complex, July 30, 1992.  6 Not to be confused with the larger town of Dukan, to the north of Suleimaniyeh.  7 Middle East Watch interviews, Ja'faran village, June 6, 1992.  8 The army's day-to-day movements are detailed in a sequence of sixteen handwritten Amn cables, contained in a file entitled 'The Purification of Qara Dagh Operation, [illegible] Darbandikhan.'

With these army victories, the military aspect of the Second Anfal was essentially complete.  16 Middle East Watch interview with a former resident of Sheikh Tawil, Bawanur complex, March 28, 1993.  17 Middle East Watch interview, Naser complex, July 28, 1992. Akram in fact later passed through a number of army lines and checkpoints along the way; but he never abandoned his goats, and this may have saved his life. Middle East Watch was told several stories of draft-age men being spared, especially in the southern Germian area, if they were tending their farm animals at the time of Anfal.  5   Third Anfal--Germian, April 7-20, 1988   'This was the first time people were taken away to end them.'  -- farmer of Golama village,   Qader Karam.   Germian--the warm country--is a large hilly plain at the southernmost tip of Sorani-speaking Iraqi Kurdistan, bordering on Iraq's Arab heartland. It is bounded to the west by the highway between the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and the town of Tuz Khurmatu; to the north by the Kirkuk-Chamchamal road; to the east by the Qara Dagh mountains; and to the south by a shallow triangle of towns--Kalar, Kifri and Peibaz.1 Almost exactly in the geographical center of Germian lies the nahya of Qader Karam, once a busy market center of some 10,000 people.   By the end of the first week in April, the straggling remnants of the defeated peshmerga from the Sergalou-Bergalou area had worked their way southward to take refuge in the PUK's strongholds in Germian. Villagers fleeing from the second Anfal headed south and west as well. Some fighters from the second malband took up fresh defensive positions in Sheikh Tawil, which had been flooded with the refugees from Qara Dagh. Others headed for the village of Bashtapa on the Aqa Su river, which bisects the Germian plain.2 (Local people call it the Awa Spi, or 'white river,' for the milky color of its flow.)   Compared to the Jafati valley and even to Qara Dagh, the flat terrain of Germian was much less favorable to guerrilla warfare. This was, however, the political heartland of the PUK revolt, and the sons of its farming villages made up the bulk of the organization's fighting forces. The villages were also filled with deserters and draft dodgers, and the peshmerga enjoyed an extensive and well-organized network of local support. 'They used to come at night and get food from the villagers and give political lectures for the villagers as to why they should fight the government and why they should not join the jahsh,' said a woman from the village of Sheikh Hamid, which lay close to the important PUK stronghold at Tazashar.3 'The peshmerga had ordered each family to buy one weapon,' added a man from the nearby settlement of Kani Qader Khwaru. 'It was like a law, and the people agreed with this because they saw it was necessary. The armed civilians would join the peshmerga in the defense of their villages. They were referred to as the 'backing force.' All the villages had this type of civil defense unit.'4   Yet there was little the peshmerga could do to withstand the ferocious assault of the Iraqi Army. This was a more conventional war, though of a grossly one-sided kind. For more than a week, the area was enveloped in wave after wave of assaults by infantry, armored divisions, artillery, air force and jahsh. The people of Germian were persuaded to surrender by the near-impossibility of escape; never before had they seen such overwhelming concentrations of troops and militia. The army did not leave the area until all living things had been captured, and they pursued any fleeing villagers, by helicopter and on foot, into the mountains and into the towns and cities.5   The Iraqi Army mercilessly exploited the PUK's weaknesses in Germian. There were no strongly fortified bases here--no Bergalou, noYakhsamar, no heavy weaponry. The few peshmerga villages with a fixed troop detachment, or teep, were easily cut off from their supply lines; deprived of reinforcements, the isolated fighters could either flee or fight until they ran out of ammunition. Peshmerga arriving from the areas of the first and second Anfals were exhausted, and there was a general collapse of morale in the wake of the chemical attacks on the Jafati Valley, Qara Dagh and Halabja. The Iraqi regime seems to have found poison gas much less necessary during the Germian campaign, although it did come into play against at least one troublesome target.6 Some beleaguered peshmerga strongholds held out for as much as five days, but in most places the resistance crumbled quickly.   * * *     It is possible to reconstruct the battle plan of the Iraqi Army in Germian in some detail, thanks to a sequence of some thirty-three 'secret and urgent' military intelligence cables, which give an hour-by-hour update of conditions on the battlefield.7 These documents depict a series of enormous pincer movements, with troop columns converging from at least eight different points on the perimeter of Germian, encircling peshmerga targets and channeling the fleeing civilian population toward designated collection points by blocking off all other avenues of escape. (see map) The cable traffic describes some 120 villages 'stormedand demolished,' or 'burned and destroyed.' Almost none of these is described as a military target; in only a handful of cases is there any report of resistance being encountered; in the rare cases where a village is searched, the soldiers tend to find nothing more incriminating than 'pictures of saboteurs and the charlatan Khomeini.'8   The intent of the operation could not be more clear: it was to wipe out all vestiges of human settlement. Several of the Istikhbarat field reports make this explicit. 'All the villages that the convoy passed through were destroyed and burned, since most of the villages were not marked on the map,' reports the Kalar column on April 13. The Pungalle column returns to base on April 20, 'after completing the demolition of all the villages within its sector.'9 No matter how thorough, a single pass was not enough; in mid-August the troops returned to 'burn and remove any remaining signs of life.'10 In one case after another, the names of the villages that have been eliminated correspond to the site of mass disappearances described to Middle East Watch by survivors.   * * *     The Plan of Campaign: (1) Tuz Khurmatu     Early in the morning of April 7, the first troops and jahsh battalions moved out from their base in Tuz Khurmatu, at the southwestern corner of Germian. Over the next two days, other units leftKirkuk, Laylan, Chamchamal and Sengaw, all converging from different directions on the town of Qader Karam. The Tuz Khurmatu column quickly divided into three task forces. One headed southeast from the town of Naujul toward the Awa Spi river. A second, larger task force moved east along the sandy river valley. Preceded by airstrikes, it dealt quickly with the resistance from the second malband survivors at Bashtapa, and quickly reported having wiped out seventeen villages at the cost of just eleven dead--eight of them jahsh.11   Two of these villages were Upper and Lower Warani, a new fallback position for the peshmerga in Bashtapa. The Waranis had suffered grievously in the past, having been burned down on three separate occasions since 1963. The twin villages also provided a bitter illustration of the effects of Ali Hassan al-Majid's demand for aerial and artillery bombardment designed to 'kill the largest number of persons present in those prohibited zones.'12   In the months preceding Anfal, there were three fatal attacks by government helicopters. One killed an old man resting in his fields at harvest time; another, a fifteen-year old girl and her mother, fetching water from the river; another, two young shepherd boys, brothers aged eight and eleven.   But Anfal was different. The troops arrived at breakfast time, set fire to the houses, killed all the farm animals and rounded up many of the villagers. Others managed to flee into the hills, where they remained for several days. But they realized that they were encircled on three sides, and had no alternative but to head south toward the highway, where they surrendered to a jahsh unit commanded by a mustashar named Adnan Jabari. It was the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, one elderly man remembered--April 17. Trucks were waiting to take them away, and many of them were never seen again. Thesurviving villagers later made a list of 102 people from Warani who had disappeared.13 As with all the villages in the Daoudi tribal area, those who vanished included large numbers of women and children.   Meanwhile, the third Tuz Khurmatu task force launched a ferocious attack on the PUK base in Tazashar, some twelve miles due north of the Awa Spi river. Tazashar was a perfect example of the dilemma that the PUK faced in Germian. A small village of only about twenty households, it had assumed a certain strategic importance because of its location on an all-weather road close to the main Tuz Khurmatu-Qader Karam highway. A small contingent of 20-25 peshmerga dug in here to fight the army forces that were advancing south from the main road. The army brought in heavy weapons and tanks, and airplanes and helicopters lent aerial support. The outnumbered and outgunned peshmerga put up a spirited defense from 8 a.m. until the early afternoon of April 9. But in a valley surrounded by low hills, they were at a huge disadvantage; meeting resistance, it was a simple matter for the army to withdraw temporarily and send troops around behind Tazashar to encircle it. The soldiers seized control of the surrounding hilltops and destroyed three other villages that lay in their path--Upper and Lower Kani Qader, and Sheikh Hamid.   Several witnesses from neighboring villages say that the army resorted to chemical weapons in Tazashar. One man in Kani Qader Khwaru, four miles away, told Middle East Watch that he intercepted radio communications from the officer in command, saying that gas was the only way to dislodge the resistance.14 This witness then sawBritish-supplied Hawker Hunter aircraft bombing Tazashar, sending up billowing clouds of white smoke. An hour later the army entered the village. All its defenders died.   Aisha, a pregnant 20-year old woman from Sheikh Hamid, watched the attack from her family's hilltop wheat field. She did not realize at first that chemicals were involved, since the Iraqi Air Force had bombed the area so often in the past. But when she came down from the hillside that evening, she saw the bodies of twenty-five peshmerga. 'It was then that I found out they had used chemical weapons, because I also saw a lot of dead goats and cows and birds.' On the night of April 10, Istikhbarat in Tuz Khurmatu cabled to Eastern Region headquarters that it had removed 'the bodies of 15 subversives, who were buried in the vicinity of the Tuz Military Sector Command; before burial they were photographed, and the film will be sent in a further dispatch.'15 Having dealt with Tazashar, the column proceeded south, eliminating another half-dozen villages before finally wiping out the last peshmerga resistance at Karim Bassam, and so reaching the north bank of the Awa Spi river.   Like everyone else from Sheikh Hamid, Aisha fled. As she was leaving the area, she encountered a mustashar, a man by the name of Sheikh Ahmad Barzinji, who had come in search of his own relatives. She asked him what had happened. 'I don't know,' the mustashar replied. 'You should just surrender to the army. This is the best thing you can do. I cannot do anything; even my relatives have been killed.'  Aisha took her children and made for the hills. She could not find her husband. With the mustashar's words in mind, she first struck out north in the direction of Qader Karam to surrender; the army had in any case closed off all other avenues of escape. But on the way, she changed her mind and decided instead to hide out in a cave with a group of fellow villagers. The mountainsides south of Qader Karam were covered with clusters of refugees. They hid in the cave for three days. On the second, Aisha gave birth to her baby. She was hungry and too weak to nurse, and had no covering to protect her child against the cold night air. On thethird day, she ventured out in search of food, leaving her day-old baby in the cave.   As soon as she left the safety of her cave, however, Aisha was spotted by a jahsh patrol tracking down survivors. She was surprised at how kind they seemed; they promised they would take her to the mustashar, who would arrange for her to be amnestied. They found their commander on the outskirts of Qader Karam. It turned out to be Sheikh Ahmad Barzinji, the same man she had encountered three days earlier in the rubble of her village.   'He took me and promised me that he would help me and he put   me in a nearby school. I felt safe in the school, and he   gave me some food. But after a few hours they brought a lot   of people into the school. A lot of villagers were coming   in to surrender; they were encouraged to do so by Sheikh   Ahmad's jahsh. The army separated the men from the women,   handcuffed all the men and put them in a separate room. When   the army took charge, they pushed the jahsh aside. Sheikh   Ahmad disappeared and I did not see him again. Then the   soldiers took all the men and put them into military buses.   Soon after that, they began to do the same thing to the women   and children.16   Aisha's story remains one of the strangest of the Anfal campaign; in an apparently arbitrary act of clemency, an army officer eventually allowed her to leave the Qader Karam school and go to Suleimaniyeh. Aisha not only survived Anfal; she was even reunited in the end with the baby she had left behind in the cave. Most people from her area were less fortunate--if that is the word to use, since Aisha herself lost her husband, three brothers and twelve other members of her family. They were among a group of at least eighty men from Sheikh Hamid who surrendered to the mustashar and were never seen again. From nearby Karim Bassam, at least twenty-five people disappeared; from Aziz Beg, a village between Tazashar and Talau, the list ran to ninety-two, many of them women and children.   * * *     The Plan of Campaign:     (2) Qader Karam and Northern Germian     Meanwhile, other army units were pursuing a similar campaign of terror to the north of Qader Karam, under the direction of Special Forces Brigadier General ('Amid) Bareq Abdullah al-Haj Hunta, who appears to have been the overall commander of the Third Anfal operation in Germian.17 Columns moving in from the west reported an uneventful advance--hardly surprising, since they were following the main Kirkuk-Chamchamal highway through an area that had largely been destroyed and depopulated during the spring 1987 campaign. They reached Qader Karam rapidly, by the late afternoon of April 10. The following morning, a column of jahsh under Sayed Jabari set out from the nahya to take care of the single, isolated village of Ibrahim Ghulam, in the rocky hills south of Qader Karam.18 The population had already fled after hearing of the fighting nearby, but they straggled down from their hiding places after a few days to surrender. Middle East Watch was given a list of the names of fifty-one men from Ibrahim Ghulam who were never seen again.19   Ibrahim Ghulam was a village belonging to the Zangana tribe, and the Zangana and the neighboring Jabari were the victims of some ofthe worst ravages of the Third Anfal.20 In April 1988, the Zangana inhabited dozens of villages to the east of Qader Karam; the villages of the Jabari dotted the low mountains to the north. Columns of troops operating out of bases in Sengaw and Chamchamal wiped out all of them. Some of the Jabari villages did manage to escape northward, through a temporary breach that the peshmerga opened on the Kirkuk-Chamchamal road. Others tried, but failed, to outrun the oncoming army troops. At the time of the Third Anfal, the inhabitants of Taeberz, a tiny Jabari hamlet on the paved road a half-hour west of Qader Karam, were in the process of trying to rebuild the homes that the army had burned down the previous summer. Hearing that waves of troops were moving towards them in a huge pincer movement from Kirkuk and Chamchamal, they fled at dawn, but were only two hours from the village when the army and jahsh tracked them down. A convoy of army IFA trucks was waiting for them on the paved road. It took them to Leilan, a nahya a little to the south of Kirkuk.   Other Jabari hamlets were deserted by the time the troops arrived. Such was the case of Mahmoud Parizad, another small settlement close to the main road and only a half-hour drive from both Qader Karam and Kirkuk. In many ways Mahmoud Parizad was typical of the whole Jabari area: twenty-five houses of mud or cement blocks, each with its own bomb shelter; neither electricity nor running water; a small mosque, as well as a schoolhouse that had been closed down and its government teacher withdrawn when the area fell under peshmerga control in the mid-1980s.   When Anfal reached Mahmoud Parizad on April 11, the army met modest resistance from peshmerga in two neighboring villages, and the people of Mahmoud Parizad fled to the mountains to escape the incoming artillery fire. They were joined there by a steady stream of refugees from other Jabari villages, perhaps 1,000 in all. Word had spread rapidly of the previous day's chemical attack on Tazashar, and the women and children decided to surrender to the army; their menfolk, most of whom were active peshmerga, remained in hiding for another two days.   At noon the women and children returned to their village, as a helicopter hovered overhead and shellfire sounded all around. The army had already taken Mahmoud Parizad, and with them was a small contingent of jahsh. The first houses were already in flames. The soldiers stripped the villagers of whatever possessions they had taken with them to the hills. Before torching the houses, the troops also looted whatever they could lay their hands on, even down to small domestic animals like rabbits and pigeons. Then they bundled the villagers into a line of waiting IFAs, and drove off north in the direction of Chamchamal, away from the flames that were now engulfing Mahmoud Parizad.   A few Jabari villagers did manage to escape the advancing troops, sometimes with the help of advance warning from their fellow Kurds in the jahsh. This happened, for example, in Hanara, which lay further north toward Chamchamal, and was linked by a rough mountain path to the local PUK headquarters at Takiyeh Jabari. There had been fighting in the vicinity for years, and a number of villagers had died in bombing raids. Whenever the injured were taken to hospital, said one who survived, the doctors told them that, 'You deserve to be treated like this because you are traitors and work with the Iranians.' The people of Hanara had grown accustomed to a routine of spending their days in the hills with their flocks, hiding when necessary in their air-raid shelters, and returning to their homes only at night to bake bread.   When Anfal came to Hanara--with helicopters and fighter planes in the morning, and ground troops in the evening--only a few peshmerga combatants were present. The other villagers took the risk of making contact with the jahsh units that they spotted nearby, and pleaded with them not to destroy Hanara. These jahsh did not take them into custody, but instead urged everyone to flee. That night, the villagers came down from the hills to find nothing but smoldering rubble. Everything had been bulldozed, including the mosque. Under cover of darkness, the villagers set out on foot and on tractors for the town of Leilan. 'I turned off my tractor's lights,' one man from Hanara remembered. 'While I was driving to Leilan, it was all dark, but I could see my village burning. I cried; I knew it was the end of everything.'21   In Leilan, the fleeing residents of Hanara met up with refugees from two other villages. Townspeople of Leilan, at great personal risk,sheltered all of them until morning. From there, relatives succeeded in spiriting away many of the villagers, taking them to Kirkuk, where they hoped to find anonymity among the crowds. Some also managed to vanish into the crowds of displaced Kurds in the large new resettlement camp of Shoresh, outside the town of Chamchamal, which at this point was little more than an open field. Here, they survived. As a result, Hanara suffered proportionately less than many Jabari villages as a result of Anfal. According to survivors, twenty-seven people from a single family disappeared from Golama; nearby Bangol lost forty-one.22 Hanara's disappeared numbered only seventeen--the Imam of the local mosque, and sixteen teenage boys who surrendered to an especially notorious mustashar named Tahsin Shaweis, whose empty promise of amnesty was repeated on a wide scale in the Qader Karam area. One survivor told us:   [The mustashar] told the villagers that there was a general amnesty, and he gave his word of honor that the youths would be protected. He would help them reach a safe place if one could be found. Otherwise, they should surrender and they would be protected by the amnesty. A man brought the sixteen young men, all relatives of his, to the jahsh leader. None were peshmerga. After two or three months, the father went back to Tahsin to ask what had happened to the boys. Tahsin told him that Ali Hassan al-Majid had talked to all the mustashars and told them that no one should ask about the fate of those who had disappeared.23   * * *     The Zangana tribal villages to the east fared even worse. A large army task force, including scores of tanks, set out from the nahya of Sengaw and moved west, with the goal of subduing an important PUK base in the Gulbagh valley, less than ten miles east of Qader Karam. It took the army a whole day to crush the resistance in this area, although it was clear that the peshmerga were fighting against impossible odds. Three of them died in Qeitoul; another seven fell in Garawi. The PUK's 59th teep, together with survivors from the 55th teep in Qara Dagh, entrenched themselves in Upper and Lower Gulbagh on April 10 and held off the troops until nightfall. Two more peshmerga were 'martyred' here, and by 8:00 p.m. the survivors realized that their position was hopeless and withdrew to the south.24   The people of Qeitawan, a village of one hundred mud houses on the Baserra river, were alerted to the arrival of Anfal by the sound of government aircraft bombing the nearby village of Garawi. Hoisting the small children on to their shoulders, with only the clothes they stood up in, they took flight. But the army dragnet caught up with them before nightfall. 'We were rich,' said an old woman who survived. 'We had fruit, gardens, all was looted. They took our tractors, water pipes, even the lantern we used to light the rooms when it was dark.'25 Deciding that they had no alternative, her four sons, aged thirty-five to forty-one, made their way to Aliawa, an old destroyed village on the outskirts of Qader Karam, where they gave themselves up to a mustashar by the name of Sheikh Mu'tassem Ramadan, of the Barzinji tribe.26 'But Mu'tassem handed them all over to the government' and she never saw them again.   The people of nearby Qeitoul, by contrast, had taken to the hills a full two weeks before Anfal reached them, as soon as they heard newsof the fall of the Sergalou-Bergalou PUK headquarters on March 19. There were no peshmerga in the vicinity at the time, and they felt unprotected. From their hiding places above the village, they saw the soldiers entering Qeitoul, preceded by jahsh units and with helicopters providing air support. After a brief debate they decided to make for the town of Chamchamal, several hours walk to the north. But they were captured in the mountains by troops under the command of Brig. Gen. Bareq. The army registered their names and sent them off in two groups of trucks. One headed east toward Suleimaniyeh; the other west, in the direction of Kirkuk. Many never returned.   Other villagers nearby were caught unawares in their homes by the army's lightning attack. This happened, for instance, in Qirtsa, a remote village of one hundred houses on a dirt road beyond Qeitoul. Qirtsa was a peaceful place--'We were living naturally, no peshmerga, no government,' remembered one resident--and the attack, early in the morning, found the villagers still in bed. Only a handful managed to reach the safety of the mountains. Gen. Bareq himself was in personal command of the troops that came in that morning, rounding up all the village men on the spot and handcuffing their hands behind their backs. The men were trucked away first. Then another army IFA departed, this one loaded up with the villagers' livestock. Finally the women, children and elderly were driven off, but only after the soldiers had looted their homes. As they waited for the IFAs and coasters that would take them away, the women watched the village set afire and then leveled with bulldozers. Sixty people disappeared from Qirtsa, including every male under the age of forty and many of the women. Another sixty vanished from neighboring Qeitoul. 'I am not sorry for myself but for the young women,' a female survivor of Qirtsa told Middle East Watch. 'We do not know what happened to them. They were so beautiful. If they were guilty, of what? Why? What had they done wrong?'27   They had done nothing wrong, of course. They were simply Kurds living in the wrong place at the wrong time. But their fate may shed important light on one of the great enigmas of the Anfal campaign. Throughout Iraqi Kurdistan, adult males who were captured were disappeared en masse--as the standing orders of June 1987 demanded. In certain clearly defined areas, however, the women and childrenvanished as well.28 In some cases, such as the Gulbagh Valley, these mass disappearances occurred in areas where the troops had encountered significant peshmerga resistance.   * * *     The Plan of Campaign:     (3) Sengaw and Southern Germian     Some peshmerga had managed to escape to the north, hiding out in the hills above the Kirkuk-Chamchamal road. Others were driven in the opposite direction, however, as army units swept methodically southward from the nahya of Sengaw to the village of Drozna, near the source of the Awa Spi river. According to witnesses, close to twenty villages were overrun and destroyed in this one small area: the PUK bases at Darawar and Banamurt (from which large numbers of people reportedly disappeared); a nearby cluster of villages including Upper and Lower Hassan Kanosh, Tapa Arab, Kareza, Dobirya and three adjacent hamlets, each called Penj Angusht29; and a little further to the east, Hanzira, Segumatan, Kelabarza, Darzila, Kalaga and Darbarou.30 The hundreds of villagers captured in this sector were taken to Chamchamal; the nahya of Sengaw would have been closer, but it had been destroyed during the campaigns of 1987. The surviving peshmerga were now driven hard up against the southern edge of the Qara Dagh mountains, where the Second Anfal had been fought to such devastating effect. Thisconfined area, where the peshmerga now also had to contend with other troop units coming from the south, was one of the bloodiest cockpits of the Anfal campaign.   At the southernmost extreme of Germian, where it borders on the Arabized area of Diyala, the first column of troops had set out from the town of Kifri at 6:30 a.m. on April 9. Later that same morning, other columns departed from their bases at Kalar, Peibaz and Pungalle. Their basic strategy was the same as in northern Germian: to launch a huge enveloping movement from several directions at once; to carry out mass arrests of all the civilians they encountered; to destroy their villages; to funnel escaping villagers toward the main road or to prearranged collection points; and to channel the surviving peshmerga into confined areas from which there was no escape. The first step, however, was to annihilate known PUK strongholds.   The initial target of the Kifri column, under the command of a Brigadier General Sami of the First Corps, was the large village of Omerbel, home to the tribe of the same name.31 There had been a PUK base on the outskirts of Omerbel ever since the founding of the organization in 1976, and a hundred fighters were on hand when the army attack began. This was a battle-hardened peshmerga force, one which had managed to repel a major army offensive the previous April. Although the assault force had included tanks and armored personnel carriers, it had been forced to retreat after taking heavy casualties, and its failure was emblematic of the regime's inability to achieve its goals during the spring 1987 campaign.   Brig. Gen. Sami's force reached Omerbel by mid-morning and immediately encountered fierce resistance from peshmerga using the heavy weapons that they had captured a year earlier. According to the PUK commander who directed the battle, the siege lasted for two whole days, and this is borne out by the terse battlefield reports from Istikhbarat.32 The army responded, however, as it had in Tazashar, by sending advance units on a flanking mission to destroy the villages that lay immediately beyond the target. '1015 hrs: village of Chwar Sheikh stormed and demolished,' an April 10 cable reported. (The village of Chwar Sheikh lay three miles to the north.) Omerbel was now under siege from all sides, and by nightfall the peshmerga, realizing that further resistance was useless, had withdrawn. The civilian population had already fled, but they were quickly surrounded by troops in the mountains, arrested and trucked away.   The main column continued northward, mopping up a smaller PUK base at Tukin and then recording a monotonous sequence of another twenty villages 'destroyed and burned' over the course of the next week, as far north as the Awa Spi river. One of these was Aliyani Taza ('New Aliyan'), a small village of twenty homes, where a retreating band of PUK fighters had taken up defensive positions.33 'Muhammad,' a 32-year old member of the peshmerga backing force, was at home when the troops arrived on the morning of April 13.   The government was advancing from all directions, so it was impossible for us to stay. We headed for Mil Qasem village. We took our wives and children and put them in tractor carts, and we took the animals, and we put all our belongings on the carts. We thought that the army was going to put us in tents at the division base (firqa) on the other side of the [Diyala] river. That is what we heard as we were leaving. The peshmerga didn't stay; they dispersed and went to the mountains.34   It took Muhammad and his family three days to reach Mil Qasem, normally a journey of less than two hours. From there the soldiers led them to the main road, and ordered them to drive under armed guard to the fort at Qoratu, headquarters of the army's 21st Infantry Division. The fort would be the first stop in Muhammad's journey through the bureaucracy of Anfal.   Meanwhile, on April 11, a secondary task force under the command of Captain Abed Awad of the 417th Infantry Regiment had split off temporarily to take care of Daraji, an outlying village a few miles to the west of Omerbel. 'The inhabitants who surrendered to the column were evacuated to a specially prepared camp close to the 21st Infantry Division,' that evening's intelligence report noted--a rare official comment on the removal and mass detention of civilians, and an explicit reference to the fort at Qoratu.35   After pitching camp at Daraji that night, Capt. Awad's task force retraced its steps the next morning to rejoin the main column. On the way, it paused to burn Belaga al-Kubra and Belaga al-Sughra, which like Daraji were villages of the Daoudi tribe. Affection for the peshmerga ran deep here, according to Rashad, a farmer in his early 60s: 'They were all our sons and daughters, all our brothers, all our people. We loved them.' Rashad was at home when the bombing and shelling began at lunchtime. With the rest of the village, he and his wife Fekri fled to the hills, but the aircraft pursued them; Fekri was hit by gunfire and killed. Those who survived the air attack were soon hunted down by a contingent of jahsh headed by two mustashars from Kifri, Sheikh Karim and Sa'id Jaff, and trucked away--presumably also to the 'specially prepared camp' at Qoratu, the first step in a journey that would end in their deaths. Among the villagers who disappeared from Belaga al-Kubra that day were Rashad's son Akbar, three nephews, two nieces and their six young children, all aged from one to seven.36 Such a heavy proportion of women and children among the disappeared was characteristic of Anfal in the Daoudi tribal area.   * * *     The first targets of the army units that left Kalar on the morning of April 9, commanded by Major Munther Ibrahim Yasin, were the twin villages of Upper and Lower Tilako, where part of the shattered firstmalband of the PUK had installed itself after the rout in Qara Dagh.37 The troops' advance seems to have been relatively painless, and by the early morning of April 11 both Tilakos had been destroyed after a short firefight that left just four soldiers wounded. This area, inhabited by the Roghzayi branch of the Jaff tribe, was poorly mapped, and helicopters were needed to airlift troops into zones that were inaccessible by road. Major Yasin's forces passed through several villages whose existence was not even officially recorded. But they destroyed them all regardless.   Few, if any, Kurdish tribal groups were worse hit by Anfal than the Jaff-Roghzayi. The Roghzayi, one of a half-dozen subdivisions of the Jaff, used to inhabit more than one hundred villages in this area; all of them were wiped out during Anfal. The head of the Roghzayi, an elderly man named Mahmoud Tawfiq Muhammad (b.1927), lived in Barawa, a village tucked away in a narrow plain at the southeastern tip of Germian, close to the Qara Dagh mountains and ringed by important PUK bases. Although Barawa fell within the Third Anfal theater, its inhabitants had been terrified into flight by the chemical attacks that took place at the end of March during the Second Anfal.   Mahmoud was a prosperous man, and twenty-four members of his immediate family lived in a large, sprawling house surrounded by vineyards and the rich gardens where they grew apples, figs and pomegranates. Artillery fire and aerial bombing had become part of daily life, and it took chemical weapons to destroy their morale. After the attacks on Sayw Senan and other targets in Qara Dagh at the end of March, the people of Barawa held an urgent meeting. Even though the PUK was present in the village, Mahmoud remembered, 'We decided to surrender to the government, the father of the people, since we were only poor farmers with no relations to any political party. Instead, they did what they did.' His son added, 'When we went to them, the government captured us, looted everything and Anfalized us. Nothing remained.'38   The people of Barawa abandoned their homes and their property and headed for another Roghzayi settlement called Kulajo, a place of forty or fifty households that lay several days' walk away over themountains, to the southwest. Although the Third Anfal had not yet officially begun, the hills were already full of soldiers. At each checkpoint, the villagers explained that they were making for the government lines in order to surrender. The troops allowed them to pass unhindered and eventually they reached Kulajo, where they spent two nights safely. But on the third day they saw that the village where they had sought refuge was surrounded.   According to army intelligence reports, the Kalar task force arrived at Kulajo at 11:15 on the morning of April 13. Just before the troops got there, they encountered a brief flurry of resistance on their right flank, from a place called Tapa Sawz, 'so this village was crushed and destroyed, and four rifles were confiscated.'39 Taymour Abdullah Ahmad, a boy of twelve at the time of Anfal, had lived in Kulajo since he was three.40 His father, a wheat farmer, owned a little land there, and like all the men was a member of the village's 'backing force.' Taymour was the eldest of four siblings. Since the family's move from nearby Hawara Berza, three daughters had been born. Unlike their kinfolk fleeing from other villages in the area, Taymour told Middle East Watch, the people of Kulajo had stayed in their homes until the last moment. But now, seeing the tanks and heavy artillery advancing toward them from Tilako, an hour's walk away across the plain, each family ran up a white flag from its roof and took flight. The men, including Taymour's father, concealed their weapons in the village wells and other hiding places. Taymour helped his parents to cram a few hastily collected household possessions on to their rickety tractor-drawn cart. Assuming that they would return to their homes before too long, they planned to take temporary refuge in the large new complex of Sumoud, outside Kalar, where some relatives had been relocated as a result of the village clearance campaign of the previous spring. But the people of Kulajo, and the fugitives from Barawa, found that the army had left only a single exit route open for them, a 'funnel' as it were, that directed them southtoward the village of Melistura, close to the main Kifri-Kalar highway.41 The journey to Melistura took two hours by tractor; they moved slowly because the vehicle was so heavily laden.   Having destroyed Kulajo, the troops pressed on to the north, followed by a line of bulldozers and empty IFA trucks. They soon reached Hawara Berza, Taymour's birthplace, and it, too, is recorded on the daily intelligence report as 'burned and demolished.'42 The next tiny hamlet, Kona Kotr, was abandoned by the time the army arrived. All six of its families had already fled. But they ran into an army patrol in the mountains, and were also ordered to proceed to Melistura. An officer promised that no one would be harmed, and that they would all be rehoused in a new complex that would be built soon. As it turned out, however, thirty-four people were to disappear from Kona Kotr's six households--a pattern that was repeated across the Jaff-Roghzayi area. Mahmoud Tawfiq Muhammad of Barawa, the elderly tribal head, lost thirty-seven members of his extended family from Barawa village--including his two wives and ten children, aged two to fifteen, as well as his son and daughter-in-law and their six small children. Another twenty-five relatives disappeared from neighboring Tapa Garus village, a peshmerga base--more than half of them children.43   On April 15, in heavy rain, the troops of the Kalar column reached the northernmost limit of their operations, storming and burning Qulijan, a village close to the Awa Spi river. One family fleeing Qulijan ran into a contingent of jahsh in the hills, headed by a local mustashar named Fatah Karim Beg. 'Your time is over,' he told them. 'This is thetime of the government.'44 They, too, were left with no option but to head south toward the main highway.   The displaced villagers spent two days in Melistura, unable to go any further, sleeping in the open fields. The crowds swelled until it was impossible to count them. 'It was like the Day of Judgment,' recalled one man from Kona Kotr who reached Melistura safely with his family and his farm animals. On the third day the soldiers instructed everyone to move on. Army trucks were brought in from the military base at Kalar, and those who had their own means of transport were ordered to follow. This rough caravan crossed the Diyala river into a stony, arid area that had been forcibly Arabized in 1975 and then laid waste in the border clearances of the late 1970s and the first years of the Iran-Iraq War. Their destination was the fort at Qoratu, headquarters of the Iraqi Army's 21st Infantry Division--the 'specially prepared camp,' in other words, that had been set up under Istikhbarat control in accordance with the March 15 order of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau Command.45   * * *     By about April 18 or 19, ten days into the Third Anfal, the Kifri and Kalar columns had completed their missions. All resistance between the Kalar-Kifri highway and the Awa Spi river had been crushed; not a stone of any village remained standing. A little way to the east, the Peibaz and Pungalle forces were able to report similar success. The Peibaz task force, commanded by Lt. Col. Muhammad Nazem Hassan, took a couple of days to subdue PUK forces in the villages of Sofi Rahim and Ali Wasman, and there were complaints that an unnamed mustashar in charge of the 75th National Defense Battalion had fled the field. But once these problems had been surmounted, the rest of the expedition proved uneventful, and after razing another fourteen villages the task force returned to base.   More serious obstacles lay in the path of the troops operating out of Pungalle, a village some eight miles south of the important Darbandikhan dam. On its first day out, the task force ran into stiff resistance from a peshmerga unit defending the village of Sheikh Tawil, already the scene of a fierce battle a few days earlier. The army commander, Lt. Col. Salman Abd-al-Hassan of the 1st Commando Regiment of the 17th Division, was wounded in an early exchange of fire, and without him the chain of command fell apart. One of the supporting jahsh battalions, the 131st, retreated in disarray; part of the army force, including another officer, was cut off and pinned down by peshmerga fire. The remainder pulled back two miles and called in reinforcements from the 21st Division at Qoratu.   Even with the help of airstrikes, tanks, missile-firing helicopters and heavy artillery, it took the army five full days to subdue the fifty peshmerga in Sheikh Tawil. But on the night of April 13 the village's defenders received the order to withdraw.46 At 14:30 hours the next day, the new commanding officer of the army task force, one Major Salem, reported to headquarters that Sheikh Tawil and the neighboring village of Bustana had both been 'occupied and destroyed.' Fifty-three families were duly reported to have 'returned to the national ranks.'47   With this, the troops were free to drive deeper into an area that had been partly abandoned two weeks earlier by the large group of villagers headed by Mahmoud Tawfiq Muhammad, tribal chief of the Jaff-Roghzayi. The PUK, along with smaller contingents of peshmerga from the Iraqi Communist Party and the Islamic Movement, had now been pinned back into their last redoubts in Germian--the string of bases along the western flank of the 5,900-foot Zerda mountain. This area had already been pounded from the east during the Second Anfal. Now it was under siege by troops advancing from the west, and by helicopter-borne Special Forces (Quwat Khaseh). It was impossible for the peshmerga toresist any longer. The last PUK defensive base at Zerda Likaw fell quickly; thousands of villagers flocked to the village of Faqeh Mustafa, where they were rounded up by troops and jahsh and trucked away; others made the arduous trek north along the spine of the Qara Dagh mountains, accompanied by the last of the peshmerga survivors. On the morning of April 20 the Pungalle task force returned to base, reporting that all its objectives had been accomplished.48   * * *     The Collection Points     'These people are heading toward death; they cannot take money or gold with them.'   -- Iraqi Army officer during the looting of a village.   Villages and small towns like Melistura, Faqeh Mustafa and Maidan in the south of Germian, and Aliawa and Leilan in the north, were the first collection centers through which the fleeing civilians were funneled. In some cases, their places of origin were noted down at this stage and their identity documents given some cursory examination. After their initial capture, the vast bureaucratic machinery of a number of specialized party, police and intelligence agencies would be brought to bear on the problem of the Kurdish 'saboteurs.' But at this early stage of the operation, almost all those in evidence on the government side were either regular Army troops or members of the jahsh militia. It would be inaccurate to describe the initial collection points as 'improvised,' since the Kurds were clearly directed toward them in a coherent fashion. Yet at the same time places like Aliawa and Melistura showed real signs of porousness--the only point at which the efficiency of the Anfal campaign seemed to break down. In part this was no doubt because even the Iraqi Army's considerable resources were stretched in dealing with such huge numbers of prisoners; but in part it also reflectedthe deeply ambiguous role that would be played in the roundups by the jahsh. (For a description of the jahsh, see above pp.43-46.)   For the villagers swept up in the northern Germian campaign, there were at least four principal collection centers: Leilan, Aliawa, Qader Karam and Chamchamal. Many captives were processed through two or even three of these centers in succession.   Leilan, a small nahya to the southeast of Kirkuk, appears to have lacked any sophisticated infrastructure for handling the large numbers of Kurdish prisoners who passed through. People fleeing the Jabari tribal villages arrived in Leilan in a number of different ways. Some made their way there on their own initiative, perhaps hoping that a town--even one of this modest size--would offer more protection than the exposed countryside, as well as food and water. But they were given a hostile reception; as they approached Leilan on foot, said one woman from the village of Qara Hassan, soldiers fired into the air above their heads. Others, men, were taken to Leilan from Qader Karam, where they had gone to surrender, in the custody of the jahsh. They were blindfolded and handcuffed.   On arrival at Leilan, the army took down basic details on each newcomer. The women wept and begged for mercy, but they were repeatedly told that they had nothing to fear, that they would be granted land by the government in a new complex and allowed to lead a normal life. But the women grew fearful when they were forcibly separated from their husbands, sons and fathers, who were crammed into an animal pen in the open air behind barbed wire. There were 'a huge number of people' there, said one witness; 'more than 2,000 men, women and children,' according to another. There were army and jahsh guards everywhere, although security was less vigilant for the women and children, and a number managed to slip away in the initial confusion before their names could be registered. At least one woman was allowed to leave by army officers after being interrogated. Those who remained slept in the open air for eight or nine days, in the rain and hailstorms of early April, before the men were driven away in army IFA trucks to an unknown destination.   While Qader Karam itself served as the main processing point for all the villages in its jurisdiction, Aliawa, a destroyed village a little to the west, was the primary collection center for many people. During the Third Anfal it was the headquarters of the notorious mustashar Sheikh Mu'tassem Ramadan Barzinji, brother of the governor of Suleimaniyeh.Mu'tassem's name came up repeatedly in interviews with Anfal survivors, along with those of five other local jahsh commanders--Adnan and Sayed Jabari, Raf'at Gilli, Qasem Agha and Tahsin Shaweis--as one of the principal agents of the roundup and mass surrender of villagers from central Germian.   Many factors drove the fleeing villagers--naive expectations that this campaign was no different from its predecessors, slender hopes of escape, fear of being captured in a prohibited area, terror of the troops who were burning their villages en masse. But a further inducement was now added: the promise of amnesty for those who gave themselves up. Using loudspeakers attached to the mosques of Qader Karam, the authorities repeatedly broadcast the message that all villagers had three days to turn themselves in--from Sunday April 10 through Tuesday April 12. During that time, they would even be permitted to return to their hiding places in the hills and recover the possessions with which they had fled. All the males who gave themselves up would be obliged only to serve a tour of duty in the jahsh. News of the offer spread quickly among the refugees, as townspeople spread word to their relatives that they had nothing to fear. Jahsh units under Sheikh Mu'tassem and the other commanders also dispersed into the hills. 'They said that the government would not harm the men who surrendered, and that they would be given jahsh papers. They told them to bring their families and surrender,' reported one survivor.49   Mu'tassem's jahsh units detained a large group of male prisoners for two days in Aliawa, where army personnel registered their names. 'There were thousands of men there,' according to one who passed through this transit facility, 'peshmerga, deserters, draft dodgers and ordinary civilians from peshmerga-controlled villages.' Here, the mustashars' message was repeated: the men would be taken to jahsh headquarters in Chamchamal, an hour's drive to the north. There they would be issued with jahsh identity papers before being returned to Qader Karam. At that point they were to go and find their families and their livestock, prior to relocation in a government-controlled mujamma'a.   On the second or third day of the roundup, Aliawa received a personal visit from Brig. Gen. Bareq, commander of military operationsin the Third Anfal theater. In his presence, the prisoners were filmed. According to another witness, a similar scene unfolded, probably on the same day, at the police station in the center of Qader Karam, where several hundred prisoners were also being held.50 This time a helicopter touched down on the adjoining landing pad, and three men stepped out--Brig. Gen. Bareq, First Army Corps Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashem, and Ali Hassan al-Majid himself. Again, there was a videotaping session, and this footage was later broadcast on national television as film of 'captured Iranian saboteurs.' The news clip was broadcast repeatedly over the following weeks, to the point where the National Security Council began to complain that its use was becoming counterproductive: people were beginning to see that these were ordinary villagers, not peshmerga fighters.51   Hundreds of other prisoners--as many as 2,000 according to one estimate--were briefly detained in the deserted complex of Qalkhanlou, just outside Qader Karam, which had been built originally to house relocated villagers from the spring 1987 campaign. Hundreds more were held in an elementary school in Qader Karam, where the sexes were separated. 'I was put in a room with many other older women,' one woman remembered. 'I was the only young woman there. I was very scared so that I covered my face with my scarf. I did not want to see anybody. We were held there for two days. Through the window I couldsee the soldiers blindfolding and beating the men.'52 After two days, a military bus came and took the older women to Chamchamal, where they were abandoned in the streets, far from their homes and with no means of sustenance. But this was an exceptional case, and the reasons for it remain obscure.53 According to one of the very few young male survivors from the Qader Karam area, 'The people who surrendered to the government all disappeared. Saved were those who managed to stay in the hills, or went into hiding with relatives in the towns, or were saved by relatives in the jahsh, or paid a bribe to the local mustashar.'54   Qader Karam itself did not survive Anfal. Once the town had served its purpose as a holding center, soldiers and Ba'ath Party members came from house to house to register the names of the inhabitants. At the same time, Amn warned the population over loudspeakers that no one should shelter Anfal fugitives, as happened in a number of towns. The people of Qader Karam were given fifteen days to evacuate their homes and move to new housing in the Shoresh complex, outside Chamchamal, and in early May the town was bulldozed. However, in a telling illustration of the logic of Anfal, these people were not otherwise harmed. They were even paid compensation of 1,500 dinars ($4,500) each for the destruction of their homes. The population of Qader Karam, after all, had been recorded in the October 1987 census. Despite its location in the middle of the war zone, the town was still, in bureaucratic terms, within 'the national ranks.'55   Chamchamal was the last of the smaller-scale detention places for the captured villagers of northern Germian. A large town and qadha, itis one of the few population centers that remains intact in this part of Iraqi Kurdistan. For those who were trucked to Chamchamal from some other preliminary assembly point such as Leilan or Qader Karam, the destination was either the headquarters of the local army brigade (liwa') or the headquarters of the jahsh.   Some male detainees were brought here by bus, and soldiers came aboard to take additional statements from them. Again, the prisoners were reassured that an amnesty had been declared and they had nothing to fear. But the mood was ominous, and through the bus windows the detainees could see thousands of hungry, ragged men, women and children on the army base.   Other men were roughly transported to Chamchamal in open-backed army IFA trucks. 'We suffered much at the hands of the guards,' said one. 'We were blindfolded and had our hands tied, and we were made to get on and off the trucks several times. The trucks had a door and one step, but because we could not see or use our hands, many fell. It was chaotic.'56 'At the brigade headquarters,' another man added, 'we were literally thrown out of the trucks, and they took our names and addresses.'57 After the stop at the army brigade headquarters, it became apparent that other government authorities were becoming involved for the first time. Winding through the streets of Chamchamal, the prisoners soon found themselves outside the offices of Amn, the feared secret police agency.   At this point, an almost unprecedented act of mercy and solidarity occurred. Anfal witnessed many quiet acts of individual courage, both by members of the jahsh and by Kurdish townspeople, and these saved many lives. But nothing quite compares to the response of the townspeople of Chamchamal as they saw their fellow Kurds being trucked through their streets. At enormous risk to their own lives--and in some cases at the cost of their lives--the townspeople staged a spontaneous unarmed revolt to liberate the detainees.58   The jahsh undoubtedly had a hand in the Chamchamal protest, and chance also played its part. The trucks that were being used to ferry the prisoners from the Chamchamal brigade headquarters were not military IFAs but commandeered civilian vehicles, with civilian drivers. Surreptitiously, the jahsh guards persuaded a number of these drivers to free their women prisoners. The drivers seized their opportunity to do so in the uproar that ensued when townspeople stoned the trucks and smashed their windows. 'Even young children put stones in their dresses, threatening to break the windows,' said Perjin, a 20-year old woman from Qirtsa village, who was able to break free.59 The soldiers opened fire on the demonstrators, and even called in MIG fighter planes and helicopter gunships to rocket the crowd. 'My dress was full of bullets from the Bareq soldiers,' Perjin said. According to one account, five people died and twelve were injured.   The uprising seemed at first to have been a partial success. Several dozen people escaped, and the residents of Chamchamal offered them refuge--'for the sake of humanity.' But this was not the end of the story. Those fugitives who were later hunted down by Amn agents were publicly executed, and in a macabre detail that recurs in many testimonies from Iraq, the surviving family members were even required to pay the cost of the bullets.60   On her second day in hiding in Chamchamal, Perjin watched a report about Anfal on the Iraqi TV news program. This was almost certainly the film shot while Ali Hassan al-Majid and his military commanders were visiting the police station at Qader Karam on April 10. It showed a group of 'captured Iranian agents who belonged to [Jalal] Talabani.' Despite his blindfold, Perjin thought she recognized her husband, Fareq, and a number of other men from her village. It was the last time she ever saw him alive.   * * *   In the southern part of Germian, there were two principal counterparts to these holding centers. Kurds who were captured from the Daoudi tribal area, as well as other villagers who fled into this sector in the wake of the chemical attack on the PUK base at Tazashar, were taken first to an empty youth center in Tuz Khurmatu. Some had already been separated by sex at their point of capture; those who had been trucked in together were now placed in two separate buildings at the youth center and held there for periods that ranged from three days to about a week. The building that housed women and children contained about 4,000 people, according to one survivor who was able to recognize people from at least a dozen Daoudi villages.   As in Leilan, a few managed to escape with the help of the jahsh, who were placed on guard duty. A sympathetic mustashar even reportedly smashed one of the school's windows, allowing many women and children to escape at night. His action almost certainly saved their lives. The regular soldiers, most of whom were Arabs, behaved much more harshly, stripping the women of any money and valuables they were carrying and telling them that 'they deserved all they got because they had supported the peshmerga.' Those who disappeared forever from Tuz Khurmatu after the trucks came to collect them included hundreds of women and children. One elderly woman from a Daoudi village never again saw her brother, husband, father and cousin--or her two daughters-in-law and the elder one's six small children. Her younger daughter-in-law, 'a very pretty girl called Leila, newly married,' was dragged away by soldiers. She clung to her mother-in-law's dress, while the older women pleaded with the soldiers not to take her. But they shoved the old woman aside, and Leila was never seen again.61   For the rest of southern Germian, including the villages of the Jaff-Roghzayi, the main processing center was the 21st Infantry Division base at Qoratu, a large, ugly Soviet-designed fort typical of those erected throughout Iraqi Kurdistan during the 1980s. After the Kurdish uprising in Suleimaniyeh in September 1991, Qoratu was dynamited by Iraqi troops as they retreated to a new frontline further south. Two months later, the Iraqi writer Kanan Makiya visited the fort. On the side facingthe Iranian border, he saw 'forty, maybe fifty wagons of the sort Kurdish farmers hook up to the back of their tractors when carting feed or livestock.' It was in just such a high-sided, wooden cart that Taymour, the 12-year old from the village of Kulajo, had arrived with his parents and three small sisters. Makiya went on, 'Piles of faded dresses and sharwal, the traditional Kurdish trousers, were tumbling now from these wagons, or lay rotting amid the dirt and clumped yellow grass. Everywhere were plastic soles, all that remained of so many pairs of shoes.'62   'There were at least ten thousand people in the fort,' one villager recalled to Middle East Watch. 'They were all tired, hungry and frightened. Nobody knew what was going on but I knew something horrible was in the making. No one could talk to each other. We were all silent and waiting to see what would happen.'63   Some of the prisoners stayed in Qoratu for just a single night, during which they received neither food nor water; others said they were held there on a starvation diet for longer periods: 'We stayed in tents at the division headquarters for three days. We received one piece of bread per person per day, and water. There were countless people there. The army registered all their names and asked them questions: the name of their tribe, whether they were with the peshmerga or the government. Everybody was afraid to say that they belonged to the peshmerga. They all said that they were farmers or shepherds.'64   Taymour himself, recalled the scene at Qoratu clearly four years later. 'All the people from the Kalar area villages were there,' he said. 'All the halls were filled. There were perhaps fifty halls, and each hall held from 100 to 150 people. We had very little food: soup, bread and water. Families were allowed to stay together. The guards all seemed to be army, all dressed in khaki. They didn't speak to the detainees. We were afraid that we were going to be killed, and everyone was talking toeach other about this, because we knew this government campaign was different from the previous ones. The jahsh had lied to us.'65   * * *     The Ambiguous Role of the Jahsh     The mustashars had indeed lied--or at least made promises that they were in no position to keep. A final word must be said here about the contradictory role of the jahsh forces during Anfal. As accomplices of the army, they undoubtedly helped send thousands of Kurds to their deaths. Jahsh units performed a wide range of appointed tasks. They protected army convoys and went into the villages ahead of the troops as advance scouting parties--or as cannon fodder. They combed the hillsides for those who had fled the army's advance and brought them down into custody, often flagrantly breaking their promises of safe conduct. They lied to the refugees, promising them the benefits of an amnesty that never existed--promising them, in effect, that this was to be just another in the government's unending series of resettlement campaigns, as a result of which they would enjoy the blessings of 'modern life' in a government-controlled mujamma'a. On occasion, the jahsh also reportedly made false claims to army officers that villagers in their custody had been 'captured in combat'--either to curry favor or, perhaps, in the hope of some monetary or material reward.   And material reward there was: It was the jahsh who benefited most directly from the application of Anfal in the literal, Koranic sense of the word--as the 'spoils of the infidel.' As the standing orders for the Anfal campaign had stipulated, 'Every item captured by advisers (mustashars) of the National Defense Regiments or their fighters shall be given to them free with the exception of heavy, supportive and medium weapons.'66 'Give the men to us and you can have the property,' washow a Ba'ath Party 'comrade' translated this to one jahsh leader.67 'The peshmerga are infidels and they shall be treated as such,' a former mustashar was told in a seminar run by army intelligence officers. 'You shall take any peshmerga's property that you may seize while fighting them. Their wives are lawfully yours (hallal), as are their sheep and cattle.'68 And indeed the jahsh looted the abandoned villages mercilessly before they were burned and bulldozed to the ground. The account given by one villager was typical of many:   My husband and I were captured in a cave where we were hiding by jahsh, who did not say anything, tell us anything or give us any reason. They just asked for my husband's ID, took it and did not return it. The jahsh took everything from my house while I was standing there, everything, including all the furnishings. I did not have any money, but they took my jewelry and the animals and the tractor and loaded everything into a truck. They cleaned out all the houses in the village in the same way. Then I saw them burning the items that they found inside the house that were not useful to the soldiers and jahsh, like people's clothes. They used kerosene to set fire to the houses; I saw them.69   But while many jahsh assiduously performed the duties assigned to them, it is also true that the Iraqi regime's old doubts about the political reliability of the Kurdish militia were well-founded, and that individual jahsh members were responsible for spiriting many peopleaway to safety in the towns and complexes during the initial sweeps. It was only because of the jahsh, in fact, that this villager, having seen her home looted and burned, was able to survive at all. 'Other jahsh guarded the Zils,' she went on.70 'They told the army at checkpoints that what was in the covered Zils was sheep. The jahsh saved most of the women and children from this village in that way.'   It seems likely that some of the jahsh's acts of clemency were inspired by bribery, a simple appeal to the same venal motives that also led to their looting sprees. One young man from the Zangana village of Qeitawan, in the nahya of Qader Karam, recalled how, at great personal risk, he persuaded the jahsh to help: 'I was able to save many family members, women and children, taking them in groups to Kirkuk, Qader Karam and so forth. At the checkpoints I bribed the jahsh with yogurt and food and everything else I had.'71   But other testimonies suggest that the most plausible reason for the jahsh's occasional flashes of generosity was that they sincerely believed the lies that they told the villagers, having been told the same lies themselves. Middle East Watch did locate one former mustashar whose unit, or fawj, had been informed by the army that 'they were going to arrest and kill or bring in men from the villages.' But this was an isolated testimony, and it came from a village in the northern governorate of Dohuk, scene of the eighth and final stage of Anfal, during which the army's standing orders appear to have been modified in several important respects. A much more widespread sentiment, certainly representative of the Third Anfal in Germian, was that the mustashars and the men under their command remained ignorant of the regime's intentions until the roundups had reached an advanced stage.   'I was never told by the army where the captured villagers were being sent,' said a mustashar from the Jaff-Roghzayi tribe, whose unit served in a number of villages in southern Germian, including Kulajo, the home of Taymour Abdullah Ahmad. 'I always thought they were beingtaken to the south.72 I never thought that they might be slaughtered. All the jahsh did was to assist the army in finding the best ways to get to the villagers, and to capture the escaping villagers and deliver them to the army.' One day, he asked an officer what was to happen to the captives. 'We are taking them to modern villages,' the man replied. But this mustashar became suspicious later, when he had occasion to visit an army camp (presumably Qoratu) and saw large crowds of detainees there. Again he asked an officer what was going on. This man answered, 'It is none of your business.' When the mustashar's suspicions turned to conviction, he says he was filled with remorse: 'We spit on ourselves for taking part in this operation; it was a crime.'73   For some members of the jahsh, the moment of realization appears to have come at the processing center in Tuz Khurmatu. Their change of heart was quite visible to the prisoners. 'When the mustashars saw that the men and women were separated from each other,' said one former detainee, 'they knew what was going to happen, and they were upset. The mustashars tried to take the women away secretly.'74   Another of the Warani villagers had been captured by jahsh who took her to Tuz Khurmatu and handed her over to the army. Soon, however, 'the men were separated from the women and packed into trucks that took them to Tikrit. When we asked what was happening, the officers said that Tikrit would be more comfortable for them.' At this the jahsh became suspicious. 'Some of them came to rescue the same people they had previously captured and handed over to the army. One jahsh freed ten women in this way. Then they took us to their homes and hid us.'75   But the real question about the role of the jahsh is what power they actually enjoyed. In the operational hierarchy of Anfal, the Kurdishmilitia was at the bottom of the pyramid, lower than the most ordinary foot soldier of the regular army. Until the appointment of Ali Hassan al-Majid, membership in the jahsh had conferred some measure of protection. Amn documents on village destructions carried out during 1986 explicitly spare those whose menfolk were jahsh.76 Now, however, the rules had changed, and a number of pro-regime villages were burned and bulldozed along with those of the other Kurds.   The promises that the jahsh made to the captured villagers, even if sincerely meant, were empty. A prosperous farmer from the Jaff-Roghzayi village of Qulijan in southern Germian, fleeing his burning village, sought out the forces of Fatah Karim Beg, the most powerful mustashar in the district, for help. He was told to have no fear. 'He issued me with a paper saying that I was with him, the mustashar, and that I had seven families with me. He told me that if I carried this letter the army would leave me alone.'77 Comforted by this encounter, the farmer made his way down to the main road to Sarqala, where a group of soldiers ordered him to halt. With confidence, he handed them the mustashar's letter of safe conduct. 'Who is this Fatah Beg?' a soldier asked. And using an expression that is grossly insulting in Arabic, he sneered, 'He is my shoe.' The letter was worthless, and the farmer was taken with all the other detainees to the 21st Division fort at Qoratu.   * * *     Several former mustashars have given Middle East Watch accounts of a number of meetings in Erbil and Kirkuk with Ali Hassan al-Majid and the commanders of the Army's First and Fifth Corps. At one of these meetings, in August 1988, al-Majid told the mustashars that the Anfal campaign was now to be taken into Badinan, the mountainous northern stronghold of Mas'oud Barzani's KDP. But on the personal orders of Saddam Hussein, the Badinan Kurds were to be given one final chance to 'return to the national ranks.' Clemency would be shown to anysaboteurs who surrendered from that area--presumably until military operations began in the north.78   Al-Majid asked for questions, and several men rose to speak. Among them was Sheikh Mu'tassem Ramadan Barzinji, the powerful and widely feared mustashar from Qader Karam who had handed over thousands of civilians to the army. According to another mustashar who was present that day in Erbil's Hall of the Cultural Masses, Sheikh Mu'tassem appeared skeptical. Would the promise be honored, he asked, given what had happened in the earlier stages of Anfal?79 But the qualms of even such an influential Kurdish collaborator, a man who had done all that the regime had demanded of him, were contemptuously flicked aside. Al-Majid told Mu'tassem that he was 'a black spot on a white mirror'; if he did not sit down, al-Majid would have him taken away and executed, 'even if Allah intercedes.' Before the Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau, even God Himself had limited powers.   ______     1 The town of Peibaz, on the main road from Kalar to Darbandikhan, is also known as Bawanur--'Father of Light'--in honor of a holy man who is buried there and whose shrine is said to emit light each Friday evening.   2 Middle East Watch interview with former PUK commander in Germian, Suleimaniyeh, March 28, 1993.   3 Middle East Watch interview, Bayinjan complex, May 19, 1992. By this time, of course, there was absolutely no incentive for draft dodgers to turn themselves in, given the recent decrees establishing the death penalty for desertion. Public and even televised executions of deserters were commonplace. See above p.66.   4 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, July 25, 1992.   5 A 'secret and urgent' field report from Eastern Region military intelligence to the Northern Bureau, for example, describes a dawn raid on April 26 on the abandoned village of Kilar. Three armored companies of the 444th Infantry Regiment encircled the village to search for 'families that had infiltrated the village as a result of the Third Anfal Operation.' All the fighting in this sector had ended at least a week earlier.   6 There are reliable reports of a chemical attack on the village of Tazashar (nahya Qader Karam). For details, see below pp.134-135. Middle East Watch has also received unconfirmed reports of a gas attack during Anfal on Khalo Baziani (Qara Hassan).   7 These cables, generally headed 'Umala Iran synopsis,' are dated April 9-27, 1988. They were found bound together with a lace in a folder whose cover bears the handwritten title, 'The File on the Third Anfal Operation (Qader Karam Sector), April 9, 1988. For all its detail, it is apparent that this is far from a comprehensive file on the Germian theater. Most of the documents originate with Kalar Military Intelligence or the Second Army Corps and describe operations in the southern part of Germian. A handful from Tuz Khurmatu and Chamchamal Istikhbarat report on actions further to the north. Some of these documents are reproduced in the February 19, 1993 report on Iraq by the Special Rapporteur of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, loc. cit., pp.102-117.   8 Second Corps cable no.10724 of April 14, 1988, describing the actions of the Kifri column. 'After occupying the village of Aziz Qader, the force inside the village found nothing but furniture inside homes and documents and pictures of saboteurs and the charlatan Khomeini. It was burned.'   9 Kalar Istikhbarat cable no. 10687 to Eastern Region Istikhbarat, April 13, 1988; Second Corps cable no. 11386 to Northern Bureau Command, April 21, 1988.   10 Amn Kalar, 'secret and urgent' cable no. 19442, August 20, 1988.

One PUK commander in Germian was unsure whether chemicals were used in Tazashar, but eyewitness accounts, together with frequent references in other interviews, offer persuasive evidence that such an attack did occur. Middle East Watch interviews with former residents of Sheikh Hamid and Kani Qader Khwaru, Bayinjan complex and Suleimaniyeh, May 19 and July 25, 1992, and March 19, 1993. It is also possible that there was a second chemical attack on April 10. A sheep farmer in the nearby village of Talau reported that peshmerga survivors fled in that direction and were bombed by aircraft at about midnight. According to this man, thechemicals killed ten people in Talau.

Other witnesses also reported sighting him at Glazerda Mountain, during the Second Anfal. According to a former Iraqi police chief, Bareq was also the commander of military campaigns against Shi'a dissidents in the south in the mid-1980s. (Middle East Watch interview with Hamdi Abd-al-Majid Gilli, Suleimaniyeh, July 24, 1992.) Bareq was reportedly executed in 1991 on suspicion of being involved in a plot to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.   18 Cable no. 10488 from Chamchamal Istikhbarat to Eastern Region Istikhbarat headquarters, April 11, 1988.

The Jabari were not protected during Anfal by the pro-regime stance of their two mustashars, Sayed and Adnan Jabari. For general information on Kurdish tribes and tribal confederacies, see Izady, The Kurds, pp.74-86.   21 Both quotations are from Middle East Watch interviews with a former inhabitant of Hanara, Suleimaniyeh, May 21 and June 28, 1992.   22 Middle East Watch interviews, Jedideh Zab complex, Erbil, May 2 and July 16, 1992.   23 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 21, 1992.

L. Sh. D/397, classified 'personal and secret,' from the Secretary of the National Security Council (Majlis al-Amn al-Qawmi) to the Interior Ministry, Office of the Minister, with copies to the Northern Affairs Committee of the Revolutionary Command Council and to the General Security Directorate. The National Security Council is a high-level advisory group headed by President Saddam Hussein. The letter also warns that 'underground cells of the PUK' may organize an anti-government demonstration in Kalar to protest the fact that 'saboteurs who returned to the national ranks along with their families' are being detained. 'Returning to the national ranks' continues to appear in army documents reporting the capture of civilians during Anfal operations. The National Security Council's May 2 warning clearly implied that Kurdish villagers had begun to suspect that the term had now become a euphemism concealing a more sinister intent.   52 Middle East Watch interview with a former resident of Sheikh Hamid village, Bayinjan complex, May 18, 1992.   53 Middle East Watch is aware of other groups being spared either because of a bribe being paid or as the result of some other private arrangement with a local official, but neither appears to have happened in this case.   54 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, September 12, 1992.   55 The destruction of Qader Karam was described to Middle East Watch by a former resident; interview in Shoresh complex, June 29, 1992. In April 1988, according to this witness, Shoresh was merely an open field, and those relocated there built their own homes under the supervision of a government engineer.   56 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, September 12, 1992.   57 Middle East Watch interview, Shoresh complex, July 1, 1992.   58 A similar partial escape in fact occurred the following month in the town of Koysinjaq, during the Fourth Anfal, but on a much smaller scale.   59 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 12, 1992. After the Chamchamal revolt, the authorities carried out house-to-house searches for those who had eluded the Anfal dragnet. It did not take a revolt to provoke this treatment: Similar searches were conducted in Kirkuk, Suleimaniyeh, Tuz Khurmatu and the large Sumoud complex, outside Kalar in southern Germian. All witnesses concur in identifying those who performed the searches as agents of Amn.   60 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, April 1, 1993.   61 Middle East Watch interview with a family from the nahya of Naujul, Benaslawa complex, Erbil, April 19, 1992.   62 Makiya, 'The Anfal: Uncovering an Iraqi Campaign to Exterminate the Kurds,' Harper's Magazine, May 1992, p.55.   63 Middle East Watch interview with a villager from Karim Bassam, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.   64 Middle East Watch interview, Zammaki complex, July 24, 1992.   65 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, July 29, 1992.   66 Northern Bureau Command directive no.

This witness was from Galnaghaj, a village destroyed in early May during the Fourth Anfal, but the essential details in her account were repeated in many other testimonies from different stages of the Anfal campaign.   70 Zils were an earlier Soviet model of the East German-manufactured IFA army truck, and the term is commonly used by Kurds to refer to either--even though by the time of Anfal IFAs were more widely used. We have generally referred to these vehicles as IFAs.   71 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 21, 1992.   72 As had happened, initially, in other words, during the well-known deportations of the Barzanis and others in the 1970s.   73 Middle East Watch interview with Muhammad Ali Jaff, Suleimaniyeh, May 11, 1992.   74 Middle East Watch interview with a former resident of the Daoudi village of Warani, Suleimaniyeh, May 12, 1992.   75 Middle East Watch interview, Suleimaniyeh, May 12, 1992.   76 A handwritten December 1986 letter from the Northern Affairs Committee of the Revolutionary Command Council reports on the destruction of three villages, but approves a First Army Corps recommendation to spare others because their inhabitants are members of the jahsh.   77 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.   78 A memorandum from Amn Suleimaniyeh, dated July 11, 1988, appears to confirm this new policy. This document reads in part:   'Comrade Ali Hassan al-Majid, Member of the Regional Command and Secretary General of the Northern Bureau, has announced the following:   1. The saboteur who turns himself in and hands over his weapon and who is returning from areas that have not been included in Anfal operations up until now, will be granted amnesty for all crimes, including those of delinquency and flight [from military service].   2. The saboteur returning without a weapon from those areas not included in Anfal operations will be pardoned for the crimes of affiliation with a saboteur group and of delinquency and flight. [emphasis in original]   3. There is nothing barring the enlistment of the aforementioned in the National Defense Battalions [the jahsh].'   79 Middle East Watch interview with former mustashar, Suleimaniyeh, June 30, 1992.  6   Fourth Anfal--The Valley of the Lesser Zab,   May 3-8, 1988   'Some were blind; some could not reach our village. The spirit left them on the way; they were all black.'  -- Na'ima Hassan Qader of Galnaghaj, describing the exodus of villagers from the chemical attack on the neighboring village of Goktapa, May 3, 1988.   After the initial blitzkrieg in Germian--there is no other word for what took place there--the remaining peshmerga forces headed north. While the army prepared to confront them there, the intelligence apparatus spared no effort to track down those who had slipped to safety in the towns or mujamma'at. On May 4, the General Security Directorate (Amn) issued orders for anyone who had surrendered in combat areas of the first three Anfal operations to be rounded up and handed over by the army into its custody for case-by-case evaluation.1   In the northern part of Germian, many villagers escaped this dragnet and survived by melting into the anonymous crowds of Kirkuk and the smaller Kurdish towns. But those in the south were less fortunate. Hemmed in on all sides by troops, mountains, well-guarded main roads and an Arabized desert area, they had little chance to elude their captors. Only a few lucky ones made it as far as Tuz Khurmatu or the new complex of Sumoud ('Steadfastness' in Arabic), outside the town of Kalar. Those who were caught accounted for the heaviest single concentration of disappearances during the Anfal campaign. While malesaged from 15-50 routinely vanished en masse from all parts of Germian, only in the south did the disappeared include significant numbers of women and children. Most were from the Daoudi and Jaff-Roghzayi tribes. Yet their tribal affiliation was unlikely to be the cause; there seems no reason why the Iraqi regime should have harbored any special hatred for these two groups. Furthermore, people from other tribes who fled or strayed south of the Awa Spi river were subject to the same treatment. Nor can the explanation lie with brutal or over-zealous local army commanders, since the detainees were transferred within a matter of days--still alive--to centralized processing camps. It was there that the intelligence services singled them out, referring to the highest authorities where necessary for a ruling on what to do in the cases of individual detainees.2   No single theory can adequately explain the mass disappearances of women and children from southern Germian, although they may in part reflect a mentality of reprisals for the stiff resistance that the army faced in such PUK-controlled villages as Tazashar, Omerbel and Sheikh Tawil. It was the inhabitants of these places, and scores of others like them, who suffered so grievously; in some cases, entire village populations appear to have been wiped out, with the exception of some of the elderly. In the absence of a comprehensive statistical survey, it is hazardous to estimate the total numbers who perished during Anfal. But by the most conservative estimate, it is safe to say that at least 10,000 Kurds disappeared from this one small area alone.3 In only one other area was a similar pattern repeated; this was in a cluster of villages along the Lesser Zab river during the Fourth Anfal, in the first week of May 1988.   Beyond the town of Chamchamal, the land falls away sharply. Immediately to the north is the broad valley of the Nahr al-Zab-al-Saghir, the Lesser Zab river, which forms the borderline between the governorates of Erbil and Al-Ta'mim (Kirkuk). (The Kurds call the river Awi Dukan--the Waters of Dukan--because it flows from the dam on the lake of that name.) It was this area which offered temporary sanctuary to PUK forces fleeing from the Third Anfal.   By about April 13, the peshmerga in Germian realized that further resistance was futile. The military leadership met secretly that day in Tilako--two days after the village had been burned by the army--and decided to organize an orderly retreat. They pulled back first to the village of Masoyi Bergach (Sengaw nahya), and then, on April 15, split up into three columns, with each taking responsibility for the safety of large contingents of women and children. Two groups headed for the Redar (Shwan) area, northwest of Chamchamal.4 The other, led by the surviving nucleus of the first malband, made for the town of Askar, a few miles south of the Lesser Zab.5   In 1988, the river valley was studded with little Kurdish towns: nahyas like Aghjalar, Taqtaq and Redar, as well as other population centers of local importance such as Askar and Goktapa. Further north the Koysinjaq plain spread out, with its untapped oil reserves; to the northwest lay the city of Erbil, and the handful of villages on the Erbil plain that had escaped the army's spring 1987 assault. These were now targeted as part of the Fourth Anfal. To the north and east, the operation extended as far as the western shore of Dukan Lake and the last outcroppings of the Qara Dagh mountain chain.   As the Fourth Anfal began, the morale of the Iraqi troops could hardly have been higher. On April 17-18, in a devastating counterattack that cost 10,000 enemy lives, Iraq had retaken the Fao peninsula at thehead of the Persian Gulf, reversing the most humiliating loss of the eight-year war and paving the way for Iran's final defeat.5   * * *     The Chemical Attacks on Goktapa and Askar     Goktapa means 'green hill' in Turkish--a language whose influence is often apparent still in this former part of the Ottoman Empire's Mosul vilayet. Although the whole village had originally been built on the slopes of the hill, some families had resettled on the flat farmland on the south bank of the Lesser Zab after Goktapa was burned in 1963, during the first Ba'ath regime, after the first of many fierce battles between government forces and the peshmerga. In truth Goktapa was more a small town than a village, with at least 300--some say as many as 500--households, as well as a school, a clinic and two Sunni mosques. The surrounding fields produced rich harvests of cotton, wheat, tobacco, sunflowers, potatoes, eggplant, sweet pepper, beans, okra, grapes, apricots, figs and watermelon. Goktapa even had electricity, although the women still carried water from the river on donkeys.   Goktapa had endured the repression familiar to most villages in the prohibited areas. From a checkpoint outside the nahya of Aghjalar, half an hour away by car on a paved road, the army tried with mixed success to impose a blockade on all foodstuffs reaching the villages on the south side of the Lesser Zab. In 1982 or 1983, after a pitched battle between government forces and peshmerga, Goktapa was savagely attacked by helicopters, aircraft, tanks and ground troops. Among those killed was a 45-year old woman named Miriam Hussein, shot from a helicopter. There had been peshmerga in Goktapa since the far-off days of Mullah Mustafa Barzani, and after 1984 the village housed an important PUK command post. As a result it was bombed frequently. 'We spent most of our lives in shelters,' said one woman. When asked to describe the attitude of the civilian population towards the peshmerga, Fawzia, a woman of sixty, smiled. 'The peshmerga were loved by the people,' she said. 'No one hates his own people.' The peshmerga protected them from the armyand jahsh, she added: 'Naturally; if there were no peshmerga, they would kill us with knives, cut out our tongues.'6   May 3, 1988 was a lovely spring day. The river valley was carpeted in green and dotted with roses and other flowers. Although it was still Ramadan, and the people were fasting, the women of Goktapa were baking bread, and the children were splashing in the Waters of Dukan. Throughout April, Goktapa had seen a lot of peshmerga coming and going, stopping briefly in the village to eat, bringing news of the rout in Germian and Qara Dagh, spending the night and then moving on. But there had been no fighting in Goktapa itself, and ten days had now passed since the last Kurdish fighters had been sighted.   An hour or so before dusk, the late afternoon stillness was broken by the sound of jet engines. Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari, a man in his late 60s, was a little distance from his home when he heard the aircraft. Everyone in this part of Iraqi Kurdistan knew of Abd-al-Qader and his famous family. His late father, Abdullah, had been the head of the Qala Saywka tribe, which owned thirty-six villages in the hills around Aghjalar. By the time he died, the old man's property had dwindled to seven villages, which he divided among his sons. Abd-al-Qader was given Goktapa, although 'I always worked with my hands; I never liked to exploit anyone.'7 His brother Ali received the nearby village of Askar--hence the name 'Askari.' In time Ali became a senior PUK commander and a close confidant of Jalal Talabani.   Askar, an hour and a half on foot from Goktapa, seems to have been the aircraft's first target on May 3, no doubt because the PUK's first malband, in retreat from Germian, had tried to set up its new base here. A formation of MIGs swooped low over the village, which was now full of peshmerga. There were eight dull explosions, followed by a column of white smoke that smelled pleasantly of mint. Borne on a southeasterly wind, it drifted as far as Haydar Beg, a couple of miles away. When it cleared, nine villagers of Askar lay dead. Members of the PUK rushedaround administering atropine injections to those who had been exposed to the gas.8   Askar was not visible from Goktapa, and Abd-al-Qader was not especially alarmed when he looked up and saw the aircraft approaching. 'I did not pay attention because we suffered from many bombardments. I thought it would be the same as in the past. We did not go into the shelters in front of our houses. No one paid any attention to the planes; we were accustomed to them. But when the bombing started, the sound was different from previous times. It was not as loud as in the past. I saw smoke rising, first white, then turning to gray. I ran away.' But the wind from the southeast carried the smoke toward him. 'I ran 50 meters then fell down. The smoke smelled like a match stick when you burn it. I passed out.'   The bombs fell at exactly 5:45 p.m., according to Abd-al-Qader's daughter-in-law Nasrin, the 40-year old wife of his son Latif, a former schoolteacher. Nasrin remembered the time with precision because her family had a rare luxury: a clock mounted on the wall. She recalled counting four aircraft, although some other villagers say there were six--and some added that a second flight of six dropped their bombs later. The smoke, said Nasrin, was red and then turned to blue. It smelled of garlic.   There was general panic and confusion; villagers were screaming, running in all directions and collapsing from the fumes. Nasrin remembered the general advice that the peshmerga had given: in the event of a chemical attack, head for the river and cover your faces with wet cloths. She grabbed a bunch of towels and ran to the riverbank with seven of her eight children. Her eldest daughter, who ran off in another direction, was later arrested and disappeared. The advice about wet towels may well have saved the lives of Nasrin and her family, since the wind blew the gas straight across the Lesser Zab river where she had fled, and one bomb even fell in the water. Dead fish floated to the surface.9   Today, a simple monument on top of the 'green hill' memorializes those who died in the chemical attack on Goktapa. Survivors say that they buried as many as 300, although a list compiledlater by the PUK gives the names of 154.10 Some died in the fields as they tended their crops. Other bodies were found in the river. With the help of a borrowed bulldozer, some of the villagers dug a deep trench in front of the mosque that had been destroyed by the army in an earlier raid, and buried many of the bodies that same night. Menawwar Yasin, a woman in her early 60s, helped with the burial. 'Some of their faces were black,' she said, 'covered with smoke. Others were ordinary but stiff. I saw one mother, nursing her infant, stiffened in that position.' Other corpses were covered over by the army with a rough layer of dirt when the ground troops destroyed Goktapa several days later. There was no time to do it any other way, an officer explained to a visiting member of the Askari family--it was hot and the bodies were beginning to smell; if they were left uncovered they might cause health problems for his men.11 Whatever the exact number of those who died, it was the heaviest toll from any confirmed chemical attack other than Halabja, six weeks earlier.   * * *     In the wake of the Goktapa attack, villagers remembered, the waters of the Lesser Zab rose quickly. It was a trick they had seen the regime use in earlier campaigns, opening the sluices at the Dukan Dam to block any attempt at flight across the river. The survivors from Goktapa, Askar and Haydar Beg scattered in all directions. Some fled south in the direction of Chamchamal, hoping to find sanctuary in the complexes of Takiyeh and Bayinjan, on the main road to Suleimaniyeh. Others headed west by back ways and goat tracks, travelling parallel to the river into the area inhabited by the Sheikh Bzeini tribe. More than fifty families from Askar were arrested on the morning of May 4 bytroops approaching along the main highway and were taken east in trucks to the complex of Suseh.   After passing out from the effects of the chemicals, Abd-al-Qader knew nothing more until he awoke the next morning in a strange room. A voice told him that he had reached the village of Mamlesi, some five miles west of Goktapa. He had been brought here unconscious by his son, the former teacher Latif. There was a smell of burning, and looking out they saw that most of the houses in Mamlesi were on fire. Abd-al-Qader and Latif crept into an air-raid shelter and waited there for three days and two nights until they were forced out by a sudden burst of gunfire at the entrance. Outside were four armored personal carriers, a contingent of troops under the command of an army major, and an IFA truck; the old man and his son surrendered and were driven away.   Meanwhile, Abd-al-Qader's daughter-in-law Nasrin and her seven crying children had found refuge in a cave. With her were thirty refugees from Goktapa, and another twenty from Mamlesi. At first light on May 4, 5:00 a.m., they went outside and saw helicopters hovering over the valley below. Some of the men had fieldglasses, and they watched in silence as the troops entered Goktapa later that morning. This account is borne out by army documents from the Fourth Anfal campaign, which note that troops had reached Askar at 5:30 a.m. on May 4 and were advancing north toward Goktapa.12 Seeing the troops approach, Nasrin and her children fled into the hills, where they survived for ten days by extraordinary good fortune before finally reaching safety in the complex of Takiyeh. Another daughter-in-law, Fahima, was less lucky; she was captured by troops in the village of Jelamort and disappeared. (Yet another member of this ravaged family, a three-month old child named Avan, was involved in an incident that is reminiscent of the baby-snatching practiced by the Argentine military during the 'dirty war' of the 1970s. Avan survived the chemical attack, although her mother, brothers and sisters all died. But a member of the jahsh abducted the infant from her crib and took her to his childless wife in Koysinjaq. The child was eventually retrieved by an uncle.)   * * *     The Anfal Dragnet: East of Taqtaq     As in Germian, it appears that the army pursued a strategy of envelopment, attacking the Fourth Anfal area with at least a dozen separate task forces from several directions at once. Fragmentary handwritten field reports of the Fourth Anfal from the commander of the First Army Corps, Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashem, show that troop columns hit the Lesser Zab valley at first light on May 4, twelve hours after the chemical bombing of Askar and Goktapa. Some, operating out of Koysinjaq, attacked the villages along the north bank of the river; others converged on the south bank from Suseh and Chamchamal; two convoys moved out of Taqtaq, one headed north toward Koysinjaq, and the other crossing the river and cutting through the area inhabited by the Sheikh Bzeini tribe.   Most of the task forces reported only token resistance, but in a couple of places the peshmerga fought back hard, and even pinned the troops down under sustained artillery and rocket fire. On the morning of May 4, Lt. Gen. Hashem reported 'fierce opposition' on Takaltu Mountain, a few miles to the northeast of Taqtaq. But by the end of the day, the mountain had been 'cleansed after killing nine of them, whose bodies were left on the site.' In the rugged Chemi Rezan valley, to the east of Goktapa, the task force operating out of Suseh ran into difficulties in one village after another: '0740 task force reached Surqawshan village, confronted saboteurs numbering 20-25....0900 task force was able to burn Awdalan and Kalabash after removing resistance....0945 Talan village burned after destroying resistance consisting of four groups of ten saboteurs.' Lt. Gen. Hashem even found it necessary to call in reinforcements, more than 700 helicopter-borne Amn troops from Suleimaniyeh.13   By the late afternoon of May 4, however, the Chemi Rezan valley was quiet.14 The next day was punctuated only by brief firefights in Goktapa and across the river in Gomashin. By May 6, the entire area was under army control. Over the next two days, military units movednorth along the shore of Dukan Lake, burning everything in their path. By May 8, the Fourth Anfal was over.   Along both sides of the Lesser Zab river, the consequences for the civilian population were devastating. Those to the north, with few escape routes, were the worst hit, and some 1,680 people are listed as having disappeared from the six large villages of Kleisa, Bogird, Kanibi, Qizlou, Kani Hanjir and Gomashin. Many people from the south bank villages, such as Nasrin and her children, reached the safety of complexes; even so, the losses were catastrophic. As many as 500 are estimated to have disappeared from Goktapa alone, and hundreds more from villages such as Galnaghaj, Gird Khaber, Jelamort, Qasrok and Qamisha.15 One daily field report from the Army's First Corps for May 6 gives some notion of how many of these people were women and children. In addition to thirty-seven saboteurs, this notes the surrender close to Taqtaq that day of sixty men, 129 women and 396 children.16   Those who lived north of the river had no way of learning about the chemical attack on Goktapa, since the army had disabled the cable ferry that the villagers used to pull their rafts across the river. But the panicked flight of the survivors, many of them blind or dying, alerted people in the villages on the south bank to the fact that Anfal had now reached them. Some fled as soon as they heard the news from Goktapa; others stayed where they were. At midnight on the day of the gas attack, survivors arrived, 'smelling of apples,' at the village of Darbarou, an hour and a half to the west on foot. Despite this, the people of Darbarou did not seem to feel that they were at immediate risk, and stayed in their own beds that night. But at 10:00 the next morning, they found themselves surrounded by jahsh and regular army troops arriving fromTaqtaq. Aircraft flew overhead, bombing, and helicopters hovered over the village, with their loudspeakers announcing 'Come out; there is a pardon for you.' The villagers were rounded up and trucked away in IFAs as their homes went up in flames.17   Goktapa survivors also turned up toward midnight at Gird Khaber, a village of the Sheikh Bzeini tribe. People here had already sensed that trouble was brewing, and some of the men had taken the precaution of sending their wives and children away to the safety of the towns, taking refuge themselves in caves in the surrounding hills. As in Germian, there were false promises of an amnesty for those who surrendered, issued in this case by Qasem Agha, a one-eyed mustashar from Koysinjaq, whom people called 'Qasma Kour' (Qasem the Blind). With the aid of this trick, Qasem Agha's forces captured 200 men fleeing from the Gird Khaber area.   But others in Gird Khaber were still at home when the Goktapa survivors arrived. They met early the next morning, in the pre-dawn darkness, to decide what to do. Some of the young men decided to take their chances in the mountains with the peshmerga, and it seems that some survived in this way. But most felt there was no alternative but to surrender. Accordingly, they made their way that morning to the village of Qamisha, where they knew the army was located, fearing that otherwise they too would be attacked with chemicals. It took them two hours to reach Qamisha, travelling packed into nine tractor-drawn trailers.   Army tacticians appear to have assigned Qamisha a role similar to that of Germian villages like Melistura and Aliawa--an initial assembly point toward which fleeing villagers could be funneled. The refugees from Gird Khaber found Qamisha occupied by a jahsh unit commanded by a mustashar named Borhan Shwani. Regular army troops were also in attendance, as well as a camouflage-clad contingent of commandos (Maghawir). 'The army was firing into the air over people's heads, scaring them,' one elderly resident of Gird Khaber said. 'They were merciless with the old people.'18 A man from Gird Khaber recognizedfaces from a half-dozen villages. An army officer with the two stars of a first lieutenant was carrying out body searches and confiscating 'money, gold earrings, everything.' Identity documents were taken away and never returned.   A somewhat different procedure appears to have been followed during the army attack on Jelamort, another Sheikh Bzeini tribal village a few miles to the south of Gird Khaber. The troops did not reach Jelamort until May 6, but the inhabitants had already heard of the Goktapa bombing from fleeing peshmerga. They took to the mountains, where they joined hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other refugees, hiding in caves or under trees. But they were quickly surrounded by the army. The troops opened fire, killing two men, and everyone else came out quickly with their hands held high. Men and women were separated on the spot and those from Jelamort were marched back to their village. Again, as in Qamisha, the troops stripped everyone of their money, valuables and documents, while other soldiers and jahsh completed the business of looting their homes. Some of the houses were already burning, and the bulldozers were at work on the cement structures. Three empty army trucks waited nearby. The sight of the looting was apparently too much for one member of the jahsh, who protested loudly. But he was confronted by an angry military officer, who told him, 'These people are heading toward death, they cannot take money or gold with them. The law of the state says they are going to die.' The commander of the jahsh unit came over at this point and disarmed his rebellious underling, telling him, 'It is the law of our state; you cannot do anything.'19   In Jelamort, then, the sexes were separated at the point of capture rather than later at one of the regime's processing centers. This was also the procedure in Galnaghaj (although married women from this village were eventually trucked away with their husbands), and in Qaranaw, just outside the town of Taqtaq, where all the women were spared for reasons that remain obscure. 'The army officers took all the men,' an elderly woman from Qaranaw told Middle East Watch. 'Then they held us in the village for two days. We could not eat or do anything. We just sat in one big line. When we were waiting in the village, thejahsh and the soldiers burned all the houses.'20 After two days, the women of Qaranaw were driven to Chamchamal in army buses and dumped in the street. 'I asked one of the soldiers why they were leaving us like this in the city where we didn't know anybody. They replied, 'You are lucky that you have ended up here; your men have gone to hell.''   To the north of the Lesser Zab, it was much the same story, as one village after another was captured and demolished by the task forces operating out of Koysinjaq. The villages of Gomashin and Kleisa, for example, lay on the north bank of the river, almost directly across from Goktapa. Anfal reached Kleisa on May 4, the day after the chemical attack. Like Gomashin, it housed a PUK headquarters and the village had a large peshmerga presence. ('Our souls were on their heads,' was how one woman put it.) Most of the villagers had moved out of Kleisa two years before Anfal, to build new homes along the Lesser Zab, which narrows to a gorge at this point. They called the place Qolti Karez, 'the pit of the underground stream.' It was here that Anfal surprised them, and after a brief attempt to hide out in caves in the mountains, they were arrested en masse and disappeared.   In October 1986, Gomashin and neighboring Qizlou had provoked the wrath of the regime when a group of Iranian pasdaran passed through the two villages, making an unusual sortie so far from the border. Aircraft had rocketed Gomashin a short time afterwards, and villagers assumed that the raid was in reprisal. One projectile hit a woman named Aisha as she carried water from the spring, killing her instantly. Another pierced the wall of a house, wounding a woman named Hajer and her 18-month old child. Since there were no cars to take them to a hospital to have their wounds treated, both died within hours.   Peshmerga fleeing the rout in the south had converged upon Gomashin in the days before the Fourth Anfal. One teenager from Gomashin, a boy of thirteen at the time, estimated that 200-300 peshmerga were in the vicinity at the beginning of May. The day after the chemical attack on Goktapa, they decided to try to make their way to Iran, appropriating the village's tractors for transport. The people of Gomashin pleaded with them not to deprive the villagers of their only means of escape, but the peshmerga brushed aside their objections. At dawn, however, the empty tractors came back with their drivers, and thevillagers now used the vehicles to flee in the direction of Koysinjaq.21 The following day Iraqi aircraft and groundforces attacked Gomashin. Many of the villagers were captured in flight and disappeared. One witness said that 115 people from Gomashin were 'Anfalized'; another put the number at 130.22 On May 6, the First Corps reported that Gomashin had been razed to the ground, together with Gird Khaber and a string of other villages.23   The Shwan Area     While the region east of Taqtaq was being devastated in this way, other army units turned their attention to the nahya of Shwan (Redar), a short way to the west. Once again they were assisted by jahsh contingents under the command of the short, stoutly built mustashar Qasem Agha of Koysinjaq. The small town of Shwan itself had been destroyed in September 1987; several of the seventy villages in its jurisdiction had already been razed during the clearances that spring, their inhabitants being relocated to the newly built complexes of Daratou and Benaslawa on the southern outskirts of the city of Erbil.   As one moves west, the landscape becomes flatter and less dramatic. Here, the Lesser Zab valley begins to broaden out into the plain between Erbil and Kirkuk, although it is still broken up by craggy hills and horizontal rock outcroppings. On the face of it, the terrain here was far from ideal for guerrilla warfare. Yet from the evidence of a dozen interviews that Middle East Watch conducted with Shwan villagers, it is apparent that small peshmerga units (both PUK and a few KDP) hung on here for several weeks, fighting occasional skirmishes before retreating. A considerable number of civilians also managed to escape to safety through the army lines.   Many of the Shwan villages, being in relatively low-lying land closer to the highway and the cities, had never been 'liberated territory' in the same sense as the more mountainous interior. More than one survivor spoke of government forces and peshmerga 'taking turns' at controlling these villages. During periods of greater peshmerga influence, there was brutal, if intermittent, government harassment in all the forms familiar in the rest of Iraqi Kurdistan--punitive jahsh incursions, burning and looting, shelling from artillery, rocketing and occasional bombing from the air. After the spring 1987 campaign of village destruction, many army deserters had rebuilt crude homes in sheltered areas, and most of the remaining villages harbored large numbers of draft dodgers. In the Shwan village of Dellu, for example, a village of eighty mud and stone houses, fully half the men considered themselves active peshmerga,and the population was swelled by some fifty or sixty fugitives from military service.   Dellu had been destroyed and rebuilt twice before--once in 1963 and then again in 1976. The Fourth Anfal reached the village on the morning of May 5, with rocket attacks from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft softening up the area for advancing ground troops from the 77th Special Forces. Some died in their homes. According to one witness, three or four elderly women and four or five children died in the initial attack, either burned to death or killed by artillery fire.24 Twenty-eight villagers were arrested in the army roundup and disappeared; they included three women and one small child. The remainder fled to the hills, and many managed to hide out, eluding Amn's house-to-house searches, in Kirkuk, Chamchamal or in the Benaslawa complex, which had been built to house people from this area a year earlier, some six miles outside Erbil.   Many people were also lucky enough to escape from Khala Kutia, a 15-minute walk from Dellu, and from Zigila, where remarkably the army managed to capture only six elderly people, including the mullah, from a village of thirty households. All the rest had been forewarned and fled. From a hideout on a nearby mountain side fifty villagers from Darmanaw, in the Sheikh Bzeini area, watched as the army and jahsh looted and burned their village; they survived for twelve days in caves, eating nothing but wild grasses. Hunger eventually drove them down to the town of Taqtaq, where 'we threw ourselves on the mercy of the people, kissing their hands.' With the help of the townspeople and a local mustashar, hundreds of fugitive villagers from the Sheikh Bzeini area hid out for several days in a poultry farm, huddled together in the chicken sheds. Remarkably, the army never found them.25   Even some draft-age males escaped the Anfal sweep in the Shwan area. This happened, for example, in the village of Palkana, after it was attacked by regular troops and commando units, backed up with artillery fire, aerial bombardment and tear gas. The villagers took flight on the morning that Anfal reached them, crossing the Lesser Zab river on wooden rafts to outrun the approaching troops. Even without food supplies, this group managed to remain in the mountains for two months,after which a number of young draft dodgers and army deserters slipped into the Benaslawa complex, which appears to have been sloppily monitored by the security forces.   More remarkable still in some ways was the escape of a group of sixty young draft dodgers from the village of Ilenjagh, a little to the east of Palkana and a few miles to the south of Taqtaq. Although Ilenjagh lay in the Shiwasur valley, a peshmerga stronghold, the village was vulnerable, since it was situated close to an army base and the paved road. In 1987 it was destroyed after a fierce battle, but the villagers defiantly returned to rebuild their homes in a secluded location a little further away from the army base. Almost the entire population survived Anfal. First, the women and children were sneaked into hiding in Taqtaq. Then the sixty young men fled with their weapons and dug into hiding places in the hills. Only two were captured. Moving from one place to another, the rest held out until the public amnesty of September 6, 1988, which marked the official end of the Anfal campaign.26   * * *     Zbeida's Story     The drama of the Shwan villagers' flight from Anfal with the help of the peshmerga is well captured in the testimony of Zbeida, a young woman who was nineteen at the time. Zbeida was a native of Serbir village, a sizeable place on the plain, toward the main Erbil-Kirkuk highway. Although Serbir was not a peshmerga village, it had been destroyed in the spring 1987 campaign that leveled scores of government-controlled villages on the Erbil plain. At first the villagers had been given two months to evacuate; officially, they were told that their homes were being razed to 'protect them from harassment' by the peshmerga. A week later, their period of notice was shortened to just twenty-four hours, and they were ordered to move into the Benaslawa and Daratoucomplexes, which at this time were merely open fields with neither shelter nor infrastructure.   Zbeida and her parents moved into the city of Erbil--not into one of the complexes as the soldiers had ordered. Her two brothers, however, who were both active peshmerga, made for the PUK stronghold in the Sheikh Bzeini area. After being harassed by Amn in Erbil for three months on account of their sons' affiliation, the parents and Zbeida eventually moved to the 'prohibited area' as well, in September 1987. Their new village was under constant government attack, and during one air-raid in February 1988, the family smelled a powerful aroma of apples from their shelter. When they emerged two hours later, they found that a number of peshmerga had suffered chemical burns although none had died.27   Anfal reached them on the morning of May 4, a year to the day after the destruction of Serbir. A helicopter had been seen circling overhead the previous day, so the attack was not entirely unexpected. At 4:00 a.m., the shelling began and the villagers immediately sought refuge in caves in the mountains. From this vantage point they could see the army entering a number of villages along the north bank of the Lesser Zab, rounding up the population and burning their houses. They witnessed the destruction of the villages of Qashqa and Khurkhur on the far shore. What they did not realize was that the soldiers were not only in the valley below but also in the mountains above their hideout.   Zbeida's family decided to flee in the opposite direction, to the east. They were fortunate, for the army soon descended on the caves and captured and disappeared their occupants. Zbeida's family, which was now accompanied by Rahman, one of the two peshmerga brothers, returned to their homes and paused there for a few minutes. But they could see the army approaching with tanks and armored personnel carriers, and they ran again. Looking back, they could see the soldiers tossing barrels of kerosene over their houses and setting them aflame. They ran on, with the troops in hot pursuit. Shells fell around them, but after crossing a series of small streams, they seemed to have thrown offtheir pursuers, and they stopped to rest in the village of Turki, another peshmerga stronghold.   Turki itself soon came under shellfire, and the refugees ran toward the Lesser Zab, hoping to cross to the other side. They tried to wade, but gave up when the water reached their necks. Behind them, the peshmerga were putting up a determined defense with rocket-propelled grenades and mortars. Eventually, Zbeida's brother Rahman managed to fashion three crude rafts from planks and inner tubes, and Zbeida, her parents and sister managed to get across. Rahman, who remained on the bank, yelled at them to make for the safety of the peshmerga-controlled Qala Saywka area.28   On the north bank of the river, they found themselves in another abandoned village; this was Shaytan. In one of the empty houses, they found bread and dry clothes. Behind them, they could still hear Rahman shouting, 'Go! Go! Run to Qala Saywka and follow the peshmerga!' They walked all that night of May 4-5 along a narrow path, resting for a few hours at dawn, until they reached the mountains, and a safe-looking cave. Setting out from their shelter in mid-morning, they could see the army continuing to burn villages in the flood plain below. In the late afternoon, by an extraordinary coincidence, they chanced upon Omer, the second peshmerga brother. He wept to hear that Rahman had been left behind and insisted on going back to join him, to try and help civilians cross the river and get away from the advancing army. But first he led his parents and sisters north, away from the river, to another village, Nerajin, where they managed to pay for places in a grossly overcrowded tractor-drawn cart. Finally, at about 4:00 a.m. on May 6, the exhausted family reached the relative safety of the Benaslawa complex.   Omer came to Benaslawa just once, in the middle of May. He stayed for two weeks, then left again in search of his brother. In August, the family received news that the two brothers had found each other and fought together in a battle with the army near Turki village in June. In this part of Iraqi Kurdistan, in other words, some peshmerga units held out for at least a month after the initial assault of the Fourth Anfal. But the peshmerga who brought news of the reunion of Omer and Rahman also brought news of their capture. Through binoculars, their comrades hadseen them being arrested by the jahsh and driven away in army IFAs. Their parents, and their sister, never saw the two again.   * * *     The Fourth Anfal Collection Points     The villagers who were driven from their homes by the Fourth Anfal were subsequently taken to at least three temporary holding centers in the Lesser Zab valley. Harmota, an army camp outside the town of Koysinjaq, held a number of detainees from Gomashin and other villages for three days after their capture. Takiyeh, a complex that had been built in 1987 on the main road leading east from Chamchamal, was the initial destination for the trucks that carried away the survivors from the chemical attack on Goktapa and its environs. One Goktapa woman learned that her daughter, son-in-law and five children had been seen in an army truck at Takiyeh; another held her brother-in-law and his family of twelve. 'The elder girl was seen crying to people to save them. She caught sight of a relative and yelled at him to try to save them, but he could do nothing.'29 Many refugees also made their way to Takiyeh in the wake of the Fourth Anfal, hoping to find refuge there, even though the residents of the mujamma'at had been warned that anyone offering shelter to an Anfal escapee would have their home demolished.30   But it was the town of Taqtaq itself, an important regional center of some ten thousand people on the north side of the Lesser Zab, which acted as the principal collection point for villagers rounded up during the Fourth Anfal. As in Qader Karam to the south, the numbers of detainees were such that more than a single holding center was pressed into service. Some prisoners described being taken to the ameriya--the town's military garrison, housed in one of the innumerable forts that dotted Iraqi Kurdistan, built to a standard design during the 1970s. An elderly man from the village of Darbarou told of being brought here in a convoy of IFAs, some carrying his fellow-villagers and the remainder loadeddown with their chickens, sheep, goats and cows.31 Along the way a pregnant woman in his truck gave birth. At the garrison he recognized people from more than a dozen villages in the valley, from both sides of the river, packed into a number of inner rooms, with men and women held separately. The villagers spent a single night there before being trucked off to a new, unknown destination.   The second location was variously referred to by survivors as 'a corral'; 'a fenced-in area used for animals'; 'a livestock pen near the bridge'; and 'some sheds used for cows and horses.' Once again, there were hundreds of people here from a number of villages along the Lesser Zab Valley. Some witnesses said that families remained together here; others disagreed, saying that young and old were segregated. Guards stood watch, but at this point there was no interrogation. These were extremely primitive facilities, and they were used only for a few hours. The soldiers also had less than total control of the crowds, and, as in Germian, members of the jahsh aided in a number of escapes. As one convoy of trucks pulled into the detention area, a young woman jumped off, clutching her baby, and managed to run away even though the military guards opened up on her fleeing form with machineguns. In the confusion of arrival, two siblings from the village of Qasrok--an 11-year old boy named Osman and his elder sister--were approached by a jahsh guard, a stranger, who whispered to them, 'Take a chance, there are no soldiers here, run away. If anyone asks you where you are from, tell them Taqtaq.' Being a resident of a town or a complex would of course offer immunity, given Anfal's rigid bureaucratic logic. The pair ducked into a jahsh car that was bringing food to the corral and managed to slip out through the army lines. It was the last time that Osman saw his parents, two brothers and remaining three sisters--the youngest of them just three years old.   After their brief sojourn in the cattle-pen, the family was hustled once more into the waiting trucks, which lumbered across the bridge over the Lesser Zab and headed south, like so many of their predecessors, in the direction of the oil city of Kirkuk, home of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Organization Bureau. Army documents from the Fourth Anfal provide revealing evidence, from the government side, of what happened to the detainees. Buried in the scrawl of his handwritten field reports, Lt. Gen. Hashem notes briefly that two groups of captured civilians from theShwan area--fourteen men, twelve women and twenty children in all--have been 'sent on to the Amn administration of al-Ta'mim [Kirkuk] governorate'--the clearest possible proof of the destination of those heavily laden convoys of IFA trucks.32   ______   1 'The following has been deemed appropriate,' reads a communique from Amn Suleimaniyeh to the agency's local office in Chamchamal: 'All persons who surrender in the theater where fighting took place during the First, Second and Third Anfal Operations, shall be sent to the Security Directorates with an explanation regarding the political stance of each one of them, in order to take the necessary measures [word illegible].' Communique no. 2827, May 4, 1988.   2 This, in addition to the emphasis on the place of capture, is the particular significance of the Amn correspondence cited above at p.121. The governorate office of Amn in Erbil has evidently found it necessary to appeal to the agency's headquarters for a ruling on what to do with particular individuals in its custody.   3 Resool, op. cit., calculates that some 200 villages were destroyed in this sector during Anfal, with a total population in excess of 35,000. On the basis of numerous Middle East Watch interviews with survivors, a disappearance rate of 30 percent seems conservative. Middle East Watch hopes to prepare a comprehensive statistical survey that will allow for a more precise estimate of the numbers who died or disappeared as a result of Anfal.   4 Redar is the town in the center of the nahya and tribal area of Shwan, and the two names are often used interchangeably.   5 This account of the PUK withdrawal is based on Middle East Watch interviews with two former peshmerga commanders in Suleimaniyeh and Kalar, March 28 and 30, 1993.   5 See Jupa and Dingeman, op. cit., pp.6-7.   6 Middle East Watch interview, Bayinjan complex, May 18, 1992.   7 The 1958 land reform did away with these old patterns of ownership.

According to Resool, op. cit., some seventy-five villages in the nahya of Aghjalar were destroyed during the Fourth Anfal, along with twenty-four in the nahya of Koysinjaq center, fifty-two in the nahya of Taqtaq, and sixty-one in the nahya of Redar. Army documents speak of 138 villages 'burned, destroyed or purified' during the Fourth Anfal. As in the case of the Third Anfal, these lists include most of the villages whose survivors reported mass civilian disappearances to Middle East Watch.   16 Handwritten daily report no.8280 of May 6, 1988 from First Corps commander to Army Operations.   17 Middle East Watch interview, Koysinjaq, April 22, 1992.

Many people disappeared as a result of these Amn sweeps.   22 Middle East Watch interviews, Erbil, July 7 and 8, 1992.   23 Handwritten daily report no. 8276 from First Corps Commander to Army Operations Headquarters, May 6, 1988. This phase of Anfal also seems to have sucked in some people who were not its direct targets. One curious case concerns a driver and two porters--one of them a 25-year veteran of the Iraqi police named Khasraw Khidr Sa'id--in the town of Koysinjaq. Sometime in early May, the three men were approached in the bazaar by an Amn agent and three members of the jahsh of Qasem Agha. They ordered the men to accompany them, saying only that they had some belongings that needed to be moved. Khasraw Khidr Sa'id's family later heard that the three men had been taken to the village of Kanibi, just across the river from Goktapa.   Three days later the former policeman's family received a message via a guard at the Topzawa camp, to say that the man had been arrested. (Topzawa's crucial role in Anfal is described in detail below, at pp.209-217.) Beyond this, the family dared not approach the authorities, for fear that they too might be disappeared. This was the last word they received from any of the three men, who then vanished into thin air.   Then, in January 1992, they learned that Khasraw Khidr Sa'id's name had appeared on a document pasted to the wall of a local mosque. The paper turned out to be a transmittal order from the Erbil office of Amn to the morgue at the city's Republic Hospital. The letter was numbered 10160, classified 'confidential' and dated June 29,1988--six weeks after the porter's disappearance, in other words. It ordered the hospital to bury and provide death certificates for four 'saboteurs,' including Khasraw Khidr Sa'id; the list also included the name of Hassan Muhammad Hassan Mawloud, the Koysinjaq driver abducted with him. The name of the second captured porter appeared on a similar document posted on another part of the mosque wall. Four days later, the family of Khasraw Khidr Sa'id obtained his death certificate from the Erbil Hospital. It listed thecause of death as execution. This case strongly suggests that Amn may have forced civilian bystanders to play an auxiliary role in the removal of the property and effects of villagers during the Fourth Anfal, and then killed them to preserve the secrecy of the operation.   24 Middle East Watch interview, Benaslawa complex, July 7, 1992.   25 Middle East Watch interview, Daratou complex, April 20, 1992.   26 It should be noted, however, that the amnesty did not put an end to their troubles. The sixty deserters were sent back to their army units, where at least some were beaten and mistreated before finally being released. Middle East Watch interview with Ilenjagh villager, Taqtaq, April 24, 1992.   27 A chemical weapons attack on this area was not mentioned by any other sources, and is not included in any of the PUK and KDP listings of such attacks.

Here and there, in caves and isolated outposts, pockets of resistance lingered. Several dozen peshmerga even remained behind in the desolation of Germian throughout Anfal and beyond. But most of the remnants of the PUK were now making their way to the remote fastnesses to the north of Dukan Lake for their final stand, to the steep mountains and narrow valleys that lie south of the town of Rawanduz and west of the Iranian border.   To the west of the lake, battered units of peshmerga had learned of--and in some cases witnessed--the rout of the villages around Goktapa in the first week of May. Along the lakeshore, in the final engagements of the Fourth Anfal, the survivors of the battles at Takaltu Mountain and the Chemi Rezan Valley tried vainly to resist the army's onslaught. They hid out as best they could for three or four days, some of them hunkered down in the grasslands by the water's edge, and resisted until their ammunition ran out. At night, according to one peshmerga, when the government helicopters could no longer spot them, they pulled back, leaving the last civilians behind. At last, by the second week of May, they had reached Korak mountain and their familiar sanctuaries in the Balisan Valley.   It was to Balisan and the neighboring thinly populated valleys that Anfal came in the middle of May 1988. This was the climax of the regime's drive to destroy the PUK once and for all as a fighting force, to punish those civilians who continued to sustain it and to expel the lastIranian troops from the northern front of the Iran-Iraq War.1 The mass relocation--and mass killing--of civilians would not be a pressing issue for the army in this phase of Anfal. The borderlands of Erbil governorate were now empty, their Kurdish population having been removed in two great sweeps, the first in 1977-1978 and the second in 1983-1984. And the valleys to the south and southeast of Rawanduz had been largely evacuated by civilians after the chemical attacks of April 1987.   From a strictly military point of view, the Anfal campaign continued to follow the logic of the great sweep that had begun three months earlier with the siege of Sergalou-Bergalou. The movement of the troops somewhat resembled the motion of a car's windshield wiper, first clockwise and then counter-clockwise, driving the diminishing forces of the peshmerga before it at every stage and 'purifying' the countryside of the last of the Kurdish villages to remain intact under PUK control. Yet the Fifth Anfal, unlike the earlier stages of the operation, gave the Iraqi Army a great deal of trouble. A second and a third assault on these recalcitrant valleys would be required, and the Iraqi Army would designate these new campaigns Anfal VI and Anfal VII.   * * *     The Balisan Valley was the headquarters of the PUK's third malband, controlling operations in Erbil governorate from the villages of Beiro and Tutma. Other parties were also present in this rugged and beautiful area, where bears and other wild animals still roamed the steep mountainsides. The Socialist Party of Kurdistan had been present here since its foundation in 1979, and there were also armed units from the Iraqi Communist Party and from Mas'oud Barzani's KDP, whose main strongholds lay further to the northwest, near the Iraqi-Turkish border. The leadership of the third malband knew full well that Anfal was on its way north. As the Fourth Anfal ended, the peshmerga began togather food and ammunition, carrying supplies through the high mountain passes on muleback to hide them away in inaccessible caves, stockpiling enough to withstand a prolonged siege.2 Hundreds of fighters congregated around the twin villages of Upper and Lower Garawan, seven or eight miles to the southeast of Rawanduz, while others took up positions in nearby Malakan, Akoyan and Warta.3   At least this time the peshmerga did not have to worry about how to protect the civilian population. Almost all the residents of these valleys had fled from their homes after the murderous poison gas attacks of the previous spring. There were only a few exceptions, such as Lower Bileh and Wara, where for very different reasons the villagers felt secure. Lower Bileh, tucked into folds of the mountains far from the road, had been a peshmerga base since even before the start of the Iran-Iraq War. Despite the chemical attack on the upper village on May 27, 1987,4 the people of Lower Bileh felt that they were protected by the remoteness of the place, and had chosen to stay where they were. But now, Bileh was newly vulnerable, since it was a transit point for peshmerga defending the frontline on nearby Chilchil and Jajouk mountains.   Wara was a different matter. There were no peshmerga in the vicinity, and the village was planted squarely on the paved road from Khalifan to the rundown town of Ranya, close to Dukan Lake. Its location made it useless as a base for the peshmerga, and past experience had taught the residents of Wara that their closeness to the government lines conferred a measure of safety. Although some had moved a few miles to Hartal, higher on the mountainside, most stayed put.   At dusk on May 15, the people of Wara were preparing for the 'Id al-Fitr, the festival which breaks the fast of Ramadan. Some of the former residents of the village, now living in Hartal, saw two airplanes fly low overhead, but they paid little attention to them, never thinking that Wara might be their objective. The nearest peshmerga units immediately realized what was happening, however, when they saw the jahsh lighting fires on the darkening mountain peaks--a sure sign that chemicals were being used. The people in Hartal were stunned when the first survivors came running to them, two hours later, to report that Wara had been hit with gas. 'As soon as we arrived,' said one man from Hartal, 'we saw four or five people in the orchard on the hillside. They were obviously dying. Then we walked on a little further and found three people dead in the graveyard. When we reached the center of the village, we saw that the place was a mess. Food was still on the stoves. There were animals lying all around, dead or dying, and we could hear their screams.'   A young woman named Amina was outside her house when the aircraft made their bombing run over Wara. 'The sound I heard was like when a car races at very high speed and then you step on the brake. Then there were four explosions, and smoke covered the village.' Amina's two-year old daughter, Najiba, was one of thirty-seven villagers who lost their lives that night.5 The survivors buried thirty-three bodies in a mass grave outside the village. Three were interred in the nearby village of Khateh, where they had been taken by tractor cart to the PUK field hospital, and one in the complex of Seruchawa, which already held the graves of fifty of the victims of the previous year's gassing of Sheikh Wasan.   * * *     Morning brought an unnatural calm, which lasted for more than a week. Then, in the early afternoon of May 23, waves of aircraft dropped chemicals in Balisan, Hiran and other neighboring valleys. The attacks became so frequent at this point that the peshmerga lost count of them. An old woman from Upper Garawan, hiding in a cave, saw two warplanes swoop down over nearby Malakan and release bombs that produced a blue smoke which 'covered the place and made everythingdark.' The gas, which smelled pleasant at first, quickly made the cave's occupants dizzy. Several of them fell to the ground, vomiting and teary-eyed, their skin turning black. A mother and her son in the cave died.6   While the entire valley suffered the effects of gas attacks against the peshmerga on Chilchil mountain, witnesses said that the largely abandoned villages of Sheikh Wasan and Balisan were hit directly for the second time. Soviet-built Sukhoi fighter-bomber aircraft carried out a 20-minute raid on Sheikh Wasan with both cluster bombs and chemical weapons. Although some of the peshmerga had German-made gas masks, there were not enough for their families, and everyone fled, combatants and non-combatants alike. In Bileh, the chemicals killed at least three children, including two siblings, Suran and Haydar Saleh Majid, aged two and three.7 Two people also reportedly died in the village of Nazanin; gas and cluster bombs fell over Seran village; chemical shells from a rajima rained on the mountain of Rashki Baneshan, and the heavy vapor drifted down into Akoyan village. Late in the night of May 23, or early the next morning, the ground troops made their simultaneous advance from three directions.   Most of the remaining civilians had fled to the hills as soon as this latest round of attacks began. 'There was a nasty smell in the places that had been bombed,' recalled one woman who fled, and the corpses of horses and sheep overcome by gas still littered the fields. Like many others, the people of the village of Akoyan scattered in three directions. Some set out on foot or on horseback for the Iranian frontier, thirty-five miles away. Others sought sanctuary in the complex of Hajiawa, which had been built in 1987 at the northern edge of Dukan Lake, a three- or four-day walk distant. Others tried to hide out in the mountains.   After an arduous journey across rough, steep terrain, hundreds of refugees, including many of those from Akoyan and Garawan, converged on the uninhabited village of Gulan, almost half way to Ranya. They spent up to a month there, sleeping in the open air and surviving on the charity of the local people. They found themselves in the fiefdom of a powerful local leader called Swara Agha, of the Ako tribe. 'He was the government in Gulan,' said one fleeing villager who arrived there. 'He had his own soldiers and jahsh; he owned everything except Saddam's airplanes.'8   But tribal loyalties are relatively loose in this part of Iraqi Kurdistan, and even though they were not his people, Swara Agha made a deal with the newcomers that seems to have been unique in the story of Anfal. Those who wished could stay in his village, he told them; he would not let the military touch them. 'He told the government we were all jahsh,' according to a man from Garawan. And indeed those who made it as far as Gulan seem to have been spared. Some chose to remain there, while others--especially those who had family members in the peshmerga and were not in the mood to take any chances--opted for the sanctuary of Iranian refugee camps. The chieftain, Swara Agha, guaranteed them safe passage as far as the border--a trek that took all day and all night, with frequent detours to avoid Iraqi troop patrols.   Others who reached Gulan decided to surrender to the army and be relocated to the Hajiawa complex, outside the town of Ranya. It appears that they were allowed to do so freely, although conditions in the mujamma'a were abysmal. For the remainder of the summer it was hot and insanitary and there was no regular water supply; the camp was monitored by a police post, and its agents warned the inmates not to go too far: only to shop in Ranya or the larger complex of Seruchawa. After September, the searing heat gave way to bitter cold, and Zara, a woman from Garawan, lost two of her seven children that winter--Shilan, aged three, and Isma'il, aged two.9   The experience of the third group of fugitives from Akoyan, those who tried to survive in the mountains, is summed up in the experience of Amina, a woman in her early thirties. Amina had left home one day at 7:00 a.m., before the soldiers could reach her village. By noon she had found a hiding place, where she met up with other refugees from Bileh and Garawan. They were some fifty households in all in the group, and they hid out for several days until word came that the troops were closing in on them. After wandering around in the mountains for hours, they reached another hiding place overlooking the village of Faqian. Here, too, they remained for four days, until the artillery fire came too close for comfort. They walked on again, losing all track of time, heading northwest over the high peaks, venturing out only after nightfall, until they reached the government-controlled village of Julamerg, exhausted and out of food.10   These were the unlucky ones, even though the first signs were encouraging; jahsh manning the checkpoints at Julamerg declined to arrest them, telling them that 'this is not the appropriate time to come to the butcher's hand.'11 Despite this, they were quickly rounded up by army troops. Their names were recorded, their photographs taken, and they were taken to the nearby military post at Spielk, outside the town of Khalifan, where they were housed for several days under canvas, eight or nine families to each tent, in an area enclosed by barbed wire. The women and children who had surrendered after the attack on Lower Bileh were also here; their menfolk, who fled to the mountains briefly before turning themselves in, were brought to Spielk later.   According to survivors, Lower Bileh was the only village in the area to suffer large-scale civilian disappearances during Anfal. The events in Lower Bileh are also referred to in official Iraqi documents. One handwritten Amn field report notes that 'on the night of June 2-3, thirty families from the village of Lower Bileh were received by the military command of FQ 45. They were counted and surveyed by us. We will presently send you lists of their names, addresses and birthdates.'12 Here is further official confirmation of what survivors reported with numbing frequency--that a specific civilian group was in government custody at the moment it vanished. The Amn note indicates again that there was nothing indiscriminate about these disappearances; no one was to be 'Anfalized' until his or her personal data had been recorded and analysed on a case-by-case basis.   Some of those affected by the Fifth Anfal disappeared from Spielk. Others were glimpsed through a window in a prison in Rawanduz. Others still vanished into the custody of Amn in Erbil. But as in the previous four phases of Anfal, the same detail recurs in one account after another: from these interim places of detention, the prisoners were bundled into army IFA trucks, which always departed south in the direction of Kirkuk.   * * *     The PUK's Last Stand     The battles raged on and off for more than three months. During the periods of fighting, says a peshmerga who saw action in the Balisan region, 'the heaven was never empty' of government aircraft.13 Although government forces quickly occupied some twenty villages in these valleys, the peshmerga felt that the difficult landscape had frustrated the regime's goal of cutting off their main escape routes to Iran. The villagers who remained in the mountains also saw that their homes were being left intact for the time being. With the terrain limiting themovement of ground forces, the campaign of village demolition would wait until special helicopter-borne engineering units were flown in towards the end of the year.   Upper and Lower Garawan seem to have been a particularly tough nut for the army to crack. The twin villages are the subject of a number of contradictory field reports exchanged by local and regional branches of Amn during June 1988. Telegram no. 1132 from Amn Sadiq to Amn Shaqlawa, dated June 3, refers to the 'purification and burning of Lower Garawan.' However, telegram no. 1136 from Sadiq to Erbil, dated June 6, refers to a continuing 'siege of Upper and Lower Garawan,' indicating that peshmerga forces there were still putting up resistance; telegram no. 1137, dated the next day, announces the 'fall of Upper and Lower Garawan.' A further telegram, no. 1179, dated June 14 and again from Amn Sadiq, informs regional headquarters in Erbil that a number of villages have now been burned, including Garawan.14   After hiding out in the mountains for weeks, several people from Garawan crept back into their village in search of food. Some homes had been destroyed by shelling, but most were still standing at this point and official records suggest that the destruction was carried out sporadically over the next several months.15 But leveled they were: Wheninhabitants were at last able to return to Garawan in 1991, after the post-war uprising, they found that 'everything had been destroyed, exploded by dynamite; even the pipes were taken that brought the water from the spring.' All signs of life had vanished, even the beehives. The poplar trees used for roofing material had been cut down. Even this was not enough, it seems. 'They also destroyed a martyrs' cemetery [for peshmerga who had fallen] that had been built in the area of Zenia,' said a fighter from Garawan, who was hiding nearby and had relatives interred there. The man watched from the mountainside through binoculars as a group of jahsh and soldiers dynamited and desecrated the graves.16   * * *     From the regime's point of view, the Fifth Anfal had been a messy and inconclusive operation--the only phase of the operation so far that had lacked a clear beginning and end. The government's intention had been to wipe out the PUK and then move on to the Badinan area, running up to the Turkish border, which was controlled by the KDP. But this goal had to be postponed for several months, because the resistance of the third malband's forces was more tenacious than the Iraqi Army had anticipated.   The atmosphere of frustration and repeated delays can be gleaned from the telegrams that flew back and forth between local Amn offices. June 4: 'Met strong resistance while advancing on Korak mountain'; June 8: 'Special Anfal Operations: Attack by Saboteurs'; June 27, and again July 8: 'Purification of Gelli Resh, Badawara, Gilga'; August 15: 'Request complete picture of purification of the region within 24 hours.'17   The sense that the Fifth Anfal was not a great success also emerges clearly from an unusually detailed military document entitled 'Analysis: Final Anfal Operation,' (Khatimat al-Anfal). This is a report to the Army General Command from Brigadier General Yunis Muhammad al-Zareb, Commander of the Fifth Army Corps. It is classified 'Strictly confidential and personal.' In essence, the report is a glowing review of the brief, triumphant campaign against the KDP-held areas of the north, between August 28 and September 3, 1988. But in reviewing the background to the Final Anfal, it speaks of innumerable delays in 'purifying' the Rawanduz-Shaqlawa sector. It also provides a revealing picture of the chain of command that ordered the successive stages of the Anfal operation.   'After the completion of Operation Anfal V on June 7, 1988, preparations and plans were embarked upon for Operation Anfal VI,' Gen. Zareb writes. 'A cleansing operation was planned to crush the saboteurs in the Alana and Balisan valleys (Anfal VI). This plan was sent to the Army Chief of Staff on May 30, 1988 in my strictly confidential and personal communication no. 1049.' But this first plan did not materialize, for, 'The Army Chief of Staff, in his confidential and urgent communication no. 1475 of June 7, 1988, ordered the postponement of the operation until a more suitable time. The Chief of Staff, in his strictly confidential and personal communication no. 519 of June 7, 1988, ordered a plan to be devised to crush the saboteurs in the Balisan and Smaquli regions.'   The main reason for the decision to suspend the campaign temporarily seems to have been the obstinate resistance of the PUK around Korak mountain, a 7,000-foot peak at the head of the Alana Valley. But the temporary ceasefire, which held until well into July, may also have been connected to the June visit to Washington, D.C. by PUK leader Jalal Talabani. Although the peshmerga were excited by this trip, which was seen as a diplomatic breakthrough, it can scarcely be considered a success. Senior U.S. officials declined to meet with Talabani, and the mid-level State Department personnel who did see him commented only that, 'Because of his Iranian alliance, his group has enjoyed a certain degree of military success at the expense of the Kurdish population as a whole.'18 This remark essentially reflected the line of the Iraqi government toward the PUK. Since Talabani is known to have informed U.S. officials about the Anfal operation and the recent chemical attacks against the Kurds, his visit also raises the question of how muchWashington may have known about the Kurdish genocide as it was happening.19   'The plan for the destruction of the saboteurs' headquarters in the Smaquli area,' General Zareb continues, 'was provided in our communication no, 1572, dated August 15, 1988 [sic].'20   'In a confidential and personal communication no. 2544/K of June 23, 1988, sent to us by the Army Chief of Staff in communication no. 641 of June 24, the Presidency of the Republic (Secretary) gave its agreement to launch the operation and destroy the headquarters of the saboteurs in the Balisan basin and the Smaquli region.'   President Saddam Hussein himself, then, evidently saw fit to involve himself in operational decisions about Anfal, at least when the campaign was running into difficulties. Gen. Zareb went on:   'In a confidential and personal communication no. 14671 of July 16, 1988 from the office of the Presidency of the Republic, relayed to us by the Army Chief of Staff in confidential and personal communication no. 861 of July 20, we were informed that the Anfal operations should becompleted with a high momentum after the religious feast [of the 'Id al-Adha], if God so desires.''21   But God did not appear to be smiling on the enterprise, and several days after the 'Id al-Adha the offensive remained stalled. 'In a meeting held at the headquarters of the First Army Corps in Kirkuk on the morning of July 29, 1988, attended by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and the Director of Military Movements, and pursuant to confidential communication no. 943 of July 29, Anfal operations VI and VII were postponed until operational requirements were completed.'   * * *     While the Iraqi regime grappled with the delays to the Sixth and Seventh Anfals, events elsewhere were giving the peshmerga fresh cause for alarm. On July 17, then Iranian President Ali Khamenei notified UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that his country was willing to accept UN Security Council Resolution 598.22 As far as the PUK was concerned, Iran's decision to end the fighting was a breach of the terms of their October 1986 Teheran agreement, which had stipulated that neither party would make a unilateral deal with Baghdad. But they were powerless to do anything about it--as powerless as Mullah Mustafa Barzani had been when the Shah cut off his supply lines to the KDP in 1975.   On July 26, the day after the 'Id al-Adha, the commanders of the third malband held an emergency meeting and decided that a partial withdrawal was its only option. Anyone who was unable to fight should now take their families to safety in Iran; the able-bodied peshmerga would stay behind to harass the troops and protect the retreat. Even as the evacuation began, the Iraqi Air Force launched another fierce chemical attack. Again, it struck all the main valleys: Balisan, Malakan, Warta, Hiran, Smaquli. Thirteen people died in a number of different locations,said one peshmerga who fought in this theater; fifteen, according to another account. The clouds of gas drove the peshmerga to seek safety on the upper mountain slopes; but early the next morning a second attack with cluster bombs drove them down again. Many of those who remained now scattered in confusion, and the last of the civilians were mopped up quickly.   A contingent of jahsh arrived in the Smaquli valley one August morning to find the population fleeing from artillery fire. Via loudspeaker, the mustashar urged them to surrender, and after five days a considerable number of people had turned themselves in. They were divided into three groups by age and sex and their names were registered. The men were told that they would be pardoned, but only if they surrendered with their weapons. Since many of them were unarmed civilians, this was difficult, and they were reduced to digging up caches of peshmerga arms in order to hand over whatever guns they could lay their hands on. Some were even allowed to buy guns from the jahsh in order that they might qualify for a pardon. The men were then ordered to sign a confession that they were indeed peshmerga. Once this grim charade was over, the mustashar recalled, 'all these people disappeared via Topzawa'--the Popular Army camp outside Kirkuk that served as the main processing center for the victims of Anfal.23   * * *     During the weeks that followed, hardly a day went past without further chemical attacks, even after the Iranians had accepted Saddam Hussein's terms for the ceasefire on August 8. Although the peshmerga were now in full flight, the Iraqi Army never did manage to cut off the two main avenues of escape to Iran. Sympathetic jahsh commanders like Swar Agha helped the last families to reach the border, and on August 26 or 27 the remaining peshmerga contingents in the Balisan Valley dynamited their headquarters and fled. By the 28th, ground and airborne forces had occupied the entire area. The PUK was finished as a fighting force, and the whole territory where it had once held sway was under the control of the Iraqi government.   With this, the regime turned its attention further north, to the region of Badinan, the principal stronghold of the KDP. This time, the campaign would not be given a number; it would simply be designated the Final Anfal. As Brig. Gen. Zareb's report indicates, the plans had been in the works for several weeks, concurrently with preparations for the Seventh Anfal. Zareb writes: 'In a highly confidential and personal communication no. 941 of July 28, 1988, sent to us by the General Commander of the Armed Forces, instructions were given to deal the saboteurs a crushing blow in the Badinan sector.'   'A meeting was held on August 7 at the headquarters of the First Army Corps in Kirkuk,' the general continues, 'chaired by Comrade Ali Hassan al-Majid, member of the Regional Command and Secretary General of the Northern Bureau. This meeting was also attended by the Deputy Chief of Staff and the Directors of Military Movements and the Air Force.' There is a laconic hint of what must have been al-Majid's fierce mood: 'Instructions were given to put an end to all acts of saboteurs in the northern region.'   After some additional meetings to fine-tune the details, the army's responsibilities were assigned. 'It was decided that the First Army Corps should operate in the Balisan-Smaquli sector, and that the Fifth Corps should operate in the two areas of Sheikhan and Zakho in the Badinan strip. This was in accordance with a highly confidential and personal communication no. 1076 of August 16, 1988 from the Army Chief of Staff.'   It remained only to fix dates. There were two. The preparatory, or softening-up, stage of the final Anfal would commence on August 25, and as in almost every preceding phase of Anfal, this meant attacks from the air with chemical weapons. On August 28, the ground troops would go in, 'with the first rays of the dawn.'24   ______   1 Losing ground rapidly after the loss of Fao, Iran attempted one final offensive in the south on June 13, 1988, but it was contained by Iraqi forces. Simultaneously, the Iraqi Army's First Corps--which handled the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Anfal operations in the area south of Rawanduz--recaptured a number of strategic mountain peaks that the Iranians had been holding in the north.

One Amn report, dated April 22, 1987 (less than a week, that is, after the chemical attacks on Sheikh Wasan and Balisan a few miles away) speaks of an attempt--presumably unsuccessful--by a joint force of army, police, Amn and Ba'ath Party Special Forces to raze the villages of Upper and Lower Garawan. Amn Shaqlawa to Amn Erbil, letter no. 5614, classified 'secret and confidential' and dated April 22, 1987.   4 See page 51.   5 Middle East Watch interview, Wara, March 24, 1993.   6 Middle East Watch interview, Garawan, April 29, 1992.   7 Middle East Watch interview, Ramhawej village, July 18, 1992.   8 Swara Agha was reportedly a former PUK member who had surrendered and made his own separate peace with Baghdad, promising that areas under his control would stay neutral. Middle East Watch interviews with villagers from Akoyan and Garawan, April 28 and 29, 1992.   9 Middle East Watch interview, Garawan, April 29, 1992. It remains a mystery why those who surrendered in Gulan were spared, while people from the same villages who surrendered to the army at Julamerg were sent to the Anfal camps. The difference may be explained by the clemency of a local army commander.   10 Julamerg lies a little to the south of the town of Khalifan, at the head of the Alana Valley. It was near here, on the banks of the Alana river, that the survivors of the April 1987 Sheikh Wasan and Balisan chemical bombing had been dumped by Amn.   11 Julamerg itself survived intact until September 3, when it was destroyed, according to a September 3, 1988 telegram from Amn Shaqlawa to Amn Erbil, no. 4799, alluding to the 'purification' of the Alana Valley by the army's 37th Division.   12 According to survivors, this list ran to 267 villagers from Bileh. 'Secret and confidential' telegram no. 1130 of June 3, 1988, from Amn Sadiq to Amn Erbil. 'FQ 45' appears to refer to the Army's 45th Division (firqa), based in Khalifan. This report is one of a sequence of forty-two Amn telegrams giving daily field updates on the period from June 3 to September 18, 1988. These papers make it possible to reconstruct in some detail the course of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Anfals--as well as providing a glimpse of the evident frustration of the First Army Corps as it attempted to 'purify' these recalcitrant areas of 'saboteurs.'   13 Middle East Watch interview, Ramhawej village, July 18, 1992.   14 Burning may not be the same thing as demolition. It is worth noting that Resool lists the date of destruction of the two Garawans, as well as the neighboring villages of Akoyan and Faqian, as August 28, 1988. He also lists many villages in these sectors as not being destroyed until December 1988. This is the case, for example, with eleven villages in the nahya of Salah al Din and eight in the nahya of Harir (both qadha of Shaqlawa). See also below, p.325.   15 This appears to have been a frequent practice. For example, an extensive file of Amn and army documents dated August 18-22, 1988 indicates that many of the villages that had been occupied during the Third and Fourth Anfals--including the sites of important clashes such as Sheikh Tawil and the Chemi Rezan Valley--were not destroyed until several months later. This campaign also destroyed any crops, vehicles and stores that remained, with the goal, as one document put it, of 'removing any signs of life' in the Anfal areas. Amn Kalar, 'secret and urgent' cable no. 19442 of August 20, 1988.   Similarly, even while the Fourth and Fifth Anfals were underway, other military units were burning scores of villages in the Qala Dizeh area, to the east of Dukan Lake, where there were no hostilities at this time. This parallel campaign of village destruction was described to Middle East Watch in aninterview with a survivor from the village of Binowshan, May 23, 1992. These villages, however, were not considered to be part of the Anfal operation.   16 Middle East Watch interview, Garawan, April 29, 1992.   17 From, respectively, 'secret and urgent' Amn telegrams nos. 1333 (Sadiq to Erbil); 3215 (Shaqlawa to Erbil); 1293 (Sadiq to Shaqlawa) and 3550 (Shaqlawa to Erbil); and 12233 (Erbil to Shaqlawa).   18 The New York Times, June 22, 1988.   19 Middle East Watch conversation with PUK officials, Washington, D.C., May 2, 1993. Documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Middle East Watch and the National Security Archive throw scanty light on this contentious issue.   One Defense Department cable, dated April 19, 1988, notes that 'an estimated 1.5 million Kurdish nationals have been resettled in camps'; that 'approximately 700-1000 villages and small residential areas were targeted for resettlement'; that 'an unknown but reportedly large number of Kurds have been placed in 'cowcentration' (sic) camps located near the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian borders'; and that 'movement by the local population throughout the north has been severely restricted.' The long section that follows is heavily deleted.   A second Defense Department cable, dated June 15, 1988, makes reference to Talabani's visit to the United States and reports on a new Iraqi offensive against Iranian forces in Kurdistan. It also makes a clear allusion to the Fifth Anfal: 'The offensive, if confirmed, follows sweeps against Kurdish and Iranian positions in both V and I Corps that have continued for about two weeks. Iran and the Kurds have accused Iraq of using chemical weapons in the operations.'   20 In view of the chronology laid out below, this date is evidently incorrect.   21 The 'Id al-Adha, in the Muslim calendar, occurs 50 days following the eighth day of Ramadan. In 1988, when Ramadan began on April 17, this would have fallen on July 25.   22 Security Council Resolution 598, adopted on July 20, 1987, called for an immediate ceasefire to be monitored by UN observers. The full text is contained in Hiro, The Longest War, pp.309-310.   23 Middle East Watch interview with former mustashar, Suleimaniyeh, June 30, 1992.   24 All these extracts are taken from the 60-page report from the Fifth Army Corps Commander to the Command of the Staff of the Army, 'Analysis: Final Anfal Operation, for the Period August 28 to September 3, 1988,' dated December 25, 1988 and coded H2/2422.  8   The Camps 'Away with them I say and show them death.'  -- Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great, Part One (V, i)  'For the young, the final stage was Topzawa.'  -- Rahman, an elderly man from Darbarou village, Taqtaq.   The Popular Army Camp at Topzawa   TOPZAWA is one of the commonest place names in northern Iraq; the map of Kurdistan is dotted with Topzawas. Most of them were tiny anonymous hamlets, of the sort that perished by the hundreds during Anfal. Like many place names, it is incongruous. Goktapa, site of the May 3 chemical attack, meant 'green hill.' Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp, was a 'beech forest.' Top, in Kurdish, means 'artillery'; zawa is betrothed. Combined, the two words evoke sniggers among schoolchildren, for they refer, somewhat brutally, to the act that is performed by the male on his wedding night.  But just as no Kurd will ever again think of 'Anfal' as a sura of the Koran, so no one will ever again hear the secondary meaning of 'Topzawa' as a smutty joke. For the Topzawa they will remember is a sprawling army base on a highway leading southwest out of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Covering about two square miles, Topzawa is bounded by two underground oil pipelines, a railroad repair yard and a military airfield. For the villagers who were trucked away from their burning villages by the army during Anfal, all roads seemed to lead to Kirkuk, and to Topzawa. At Topzawa, any notion that Anfal was simply a counterinsurgency campaign evaporates.  No official documents have so far come to light from the Kirkuk headquarters of the various agencies that were involved in Anfal. But a letter from Amn Suleimaniyeh to the unnamed director of security of the Autonomous Region, dated October 29, 1988, alludes to the Topzawaoperation and gives some small hint of its scale. Almost two months have now passed since the completion of Anfal, and the regional security director in Kirkuk has evidently telephoned to ask for a progress report from the Suleimaniyeh governorate. The reply is classified 'Secret and personal, to be opened by addressee only.'  It begins, 'In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful: Distinguished Director of the Autonomous Region, with reference to our telephone conversation, the statistics requested are as follows...' There is a brief recitation of actions taken: nine criminal subversives executed, along with eighteen members of their families, as ordered by Ali Hassan al-Majid's office; another nineteen people executed for being found in prohibited areas, in violation of directive no. 4008 of June 20, 1987; another forty-seven subversives sentenced to death by the Revolutionary Court; and finally this: '2,532 individuals and 1,869 families totalling 9,030 persons, who were among those arrested during the heroic 'Anfal' operations, were sent to the Popular Army1 camp in the governorate of al-Ta'mim (Kirkuk).'2 In other words, to Topzawa.  * * *   From the collection points at Qader Karam and Qoratu and Leilan they came, from Chamchamal and Aliawa and Taqtaq, crammed into the swaying IFA trucks like farm beasts. 'From Taqtaq we were taken the next day [about May 7] in a military truck with a cow,' remembered Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari, the dignified old village leader of Goktapa, with a rueful laugh. 'This was insulting. You know what cows do, they shit. At the turn-off on the road from Redar to Erbil,they dropped off the cow. I said to the cow, 'We're both going to be slaughtered, pardon me if I have done something wrong to you in the past''--this being a traditional Muslim way of bidding final farewell.3  The truck lumbered on to Kirkuk, where it stopped for an hour or so outside the Ba'ath Party building. (Many witnesses recalled making a brief halt either here or at the Kirkuk headquarters of Amn.) Abd-al-Qader counted fourteen young men being hustled on to the truck by soldiers. Before long the vehicle drew up outside the gates of Topzawa. The minority of villagers who were literate could read the name on a sign at the entrance.  'It was very late at night when we arrived at Topzawa,' said Yawar, a 70-year old man who believed he was Anfal's only survivor from his home village of Karim Bassam (nahya Qader Karam).  We were all hungry and exhausted. We were almost dead. We had not eaten for several days. We had even lost our sense of time. We did not know what they wanted to do with us. When we reached the base they announced over the loudspeakers that we should not get out of the trucks until they told us to do so. There were eight or nine trucks that arrived together. Their backs were covered; we could not see anything inside. We stayed in the truck for about one hour before the soldiers opened up the back and said, 'The men, just the men will get off first.' I was so hungry and exhausted that I could not move, so I was the last to get off. The young ones got off first; as soon as they did, they were handcuffed.4  With only minor variations, this was the standard pattern for sorting the new arrivals. Men and women were segregated on the spot, as soon as the trucks had rolled to a halt in the base's large central courtyard or parade ground. The process was brutal, and it did not spare the elderly. One 70-year old man from the nahya of Shwan was draggedout of line for no apparent reason, beaten by an officer wearing the three stars of a captain on his shoulder and robbed of 3,000 dinars ($9,000 at the official 1988 exchange rate). Abd-al-Qader of Goktapa recalled that a colonel (aqid) was in charge of processing the new arrivals, assisted by a captain (naqib).5  A little later, the men were further divided by age--small children kept with their mothers, the elderly and infirm shunted off to separate quarters, and men and teenage boys considered to be of an age to use a weapon herded together. Roughly speaking, this meant males of between fifteen and fifty, but there was no rigorous check of identity documents--and strict chronological age seems to have been less of a criterion than size and appearance. A strapping twelve-year old could fail to make the cut; an undersized sixteen-year old could be told to remain with his female relatives. A prematurely gray or grizzled-looking peasant could be spared, even though he might be in his forties.  'We joined thousands of other Kurds who had been brought there before our group,' said one such man, Jalal, a 45-year old farmer from southern Germian who was transported to Topzawa in mid-April from the 21st Division fort at Qoratu.  We just did not know what would happen. We could not speak; fear would not let us speak, everyone was mute. The only sound that we heard was when the military officers called out names. 'Accused Ali Rahman, son of so and so... Accused Mustafa Taher, son of so and so...' They were announcing the names of the youths over the loudspeakers. They did not call the old men.'6  It was time now to process the younger males. They were split up into smaller groups--lines of eight, one said; seated in a smaller courtyard, said another. No one told the prisoners why they had beenbrought here, or what was to happen to them. After separation into groups, they were body-searched by soldiers or Istikhbarat agents. Some had their IDs removed at this point, but not all--perhaps, as one survivor suggested, because the guards were simply overwhelmed by the magnitude of their task. Combs, razor blades, mirrors, knives, belts, worry beads: everything was taken from the prisoners but the clothes they stood up in. 'I saw a pile of watches, belts and money taken from the villagers and heaped up on the floor,' one woman remembered. 'You could weep.'7  Some of the detainees were interrogated immediately, others hauled out later from their cells at night. In any event, for most of the newcomers the interrogation was quite perfunctory--no more, really, than the taking of a brief statement and a few simple questions: name, mother's name, number of siblings, marital status, year of marriage, number of children.8 'How long have you been a peshmerga?' the men were asked. 'What actions did you take part in?' Many feared to give truthful answers. 'I have never been a peshmerga,' one young man answered typically. The interrogator, who was wearing the uniform of the army Special Forces (Quwat al-Khaseh), wrote down 'peshmerga' anyway.9  Once duly registered, the prisoners were hustled into a number of large rooms, or halls, each filled with residents of a single area. One witness counted twenty-eight of these halls, and estimates of the numbersof prisoners held in each varied from one to two hundred. Using these figures as a rough yardstick, the total population of the Topzawa base at any given time may have been some 4,000-5,000. But the inmates shifted constantly, with most remaining there for as little as a single night or as much as four days before being taken on to their next destination.  While the conditions at Topzawa were appalling for everyone, the most grossly overcrowded quarters seem to have been those in which the male detainees were held. 'We could not leave our hall,' said one boy from near Qader Karam, who was held with others who were considered younger than military-service age but too old to stay with their mothers. 'It was made of cement, heavily built and very strong with bars on the windows and doors but no glass. The hall measured about six meters by thirty, and was very crowded. There was no room to lie down.'10 Other men described being forced to squat on their haunches all night, and beaten if they attempted to stand up. Many of their companions fainted from exhaustion.  Sanitation was non-existent. The prisoners used cans in the room for their bowel movements, and urinated out of the door or simply on the floor where they stood. If they were fortunate, they might be taken to the toilet twice a day at gunpoint, in groups of five or ten, by guards who sometimes beat them on the way with a strip of coaxial cable. Most were suffering from diarrhea by this time, especially if they ate the prison food. 'It was something that it is better not to describe,' said one of the few young men who survived Topzawa. 'If you were not hungry you would not eat it. It was a type of soup with left-over bones and a lot of oil floating in it. Everybody got sick.' For many inmates of Topzawa, there was not even this--merely two small pieces of stale pita bread (samoun) each day, and a little water. Some received no food at all. Again, women and children fared a little less harshly, and some of them told of occasionally being given meager rations of rice, tea, cheese or even, in one case, a little meat.  But the women and children suffered grievously in their own ways. After a short time in which they remained together, baton-wielding guards dragged the older women away violently from their daughters and grandchildren and bundled them away to yet another unknown destination. In at least two reported cases, soldiers and guards burst intothe women's quarters during their first night at Topzawa and removed their small children, even infants at the breast. All night long the women could hear the cries and screams of their children in another room. In one instance, the children were returned to their mothers the next morning, without a word of explanation, after a six or seven-hour separation. In the other, the families were not reunited until the next stage of their ordeal, when they were herded once more into army IFAs and transferred from Topzawa to a prison for women and children at Dibs, on the road that leads northwest from Kirkuk to Erbil and Mosul. Taymour Abdullah Ahmad, the twelve-year old boy who had been captured by the army on April 13 in the village of Kulajo, said he was held at Topzawa with his mother and three sisters for a month--an exceptionally long stay.11 During that time, he witnessed the deaths of four children, aged five to nine, apparently from starvation. Soldiers removed their bodies, and Taymour learned later that they were thrown into a pit outside.12  But above all the women and children of Topzawa endured the torment of seeing their husbands, brothers and fathers suffer and, in the end, disappear. Through the barred windows of their halls, they could see their menfolk in another part of the prison. Every two or three days, said Taymour, the inmates of his cell were let out for air and allowed to mingle in the central courtyard. The children would take advantage of the moment to slip across to the men's quarters and throw bread in at the windows.  For the men, beatings were routine. Even old Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari of Goktapa was beaten, a man in his late 60s still weak and disoriented from the chemical bombing of his village several days earlier. On the night of his arrival, a guard ordered him to stand. He replied that he could not, because of the gas. The guard rushed at himin a fury and beat him, screaming that it was forbidden for anyone to speak of poison gas attacks.13  A young army deserter from the Qader Karam area, known to his friends as Ozer, was held captive for four days in Topzawa. During that time one of his cellmates was a bearded man from the village of Khalo Baziani, in the nahya of Qara Hassan. The man told Ozer he had been tortured. They had to talk discreetly because of the ever-present guards, but Ozer was able to learn that the man had been beaten with a cable, hung from a ceiling fan and scorched with a piece of hot steel. Guards had stamped on his back with their boots while he lay face-down on the floor. The man was in great pain. He said he had been singled out for harsh treatment because of his beard--which was presumably taken as a sign of Islamic fundamentalism and pro-Iranian sympathies.14 An officer had told him that he would be executed if the beard was not gone by the following day. That evening, Ozer cut off the beard of this man and five others with a small pair of nail scissors that one of the prisoners had managed to keep hidden.  On the fourth day of Ozer's confinement, at 1:30 in the morning, an army captain came in and ordered the prisoners to stand. He told them that he would read a list of names; anyone who failed to answer when they were called would be executed on the spot in front of the others. One after the other the prisoners were summoned to the officer's table. Ozer saw that each man had been assigned a serial number; his own was 375. As their names were called, the prisoners were led out of the room in groups of eight. After four days on a starvation diet, they were weakened and disoriented. Ozer found himself in a second, empty hall. After the stuffy heat of his previous overcrowded quarters, he was chilled by the cold of the mid-April night. The floor was stained with diesel oil, and there were three patches of fresh blood. A bloodstainedKurdish headscarf lay in a corner, along with a coat and a pair of baggy Kurdish pants. At about 4:00 a.m. the prisoners heard the sound of engines outside. They tried to peer out of the keyhole, but it was impossible to make out anything in the darkness. For another four hours they waited, numb with cold, hunger and fear.  These early morning movements of male prisoners were observed by women and older people in other sections of Topzawa. 'We saw them taking off the men's shirts and beating them,' said one elderly man. 'They were handcuffed to each other in pairs, and they took away their shoes. This was going on from 8:00 a.m. until noon.'15 Sometimes the men were blindfolded as well; according to some accounts they were stripped to their shorts. And at last they were packed into sinister-looking vehicles, painted white or green and windowless; these were variously described as resembling buses, ambulances or closed trucks.  This was the last that was seen of the men who had been held at Topzawa. As the windowless vehicles left in one direction, buses drove off in another, filled with the other detainees. For many of the women and children--but by no means all of them, as we shall see--the next destination was the prison of Dibs. For the elderly, the road led south, through the river valleys of central Iraq, before turning southwest, into the desert. 'The Kurds are traitors, and we know where to send you,' a military officer told one old man from Naujul. 'We will send you to a hell that is built especially for the Kurds.'16 Its name was Nugra Salman.  * * *   The Popular Army Camp at Tikrit   Many tens of thousands of Kurdish villagers swept up in the third and fourth stages of Anfal passed through the Popular Army base of Topzawa in this way. So did smaller numbers of Kurds from the second, fifth, sixth and seventh Anfals. A note should also be added here about the Popular Army barracks in the town of Tikrit, which lies southwest ofKirkuk on the banks of the Tigris river, close to the birthplace of President Saddam Hussein. Tikrit appears to have performed a broadly similar function to Topzawa, but on a smaller scale and for a much shorter period. Indeed, all the witnesses who had spent time in Tikrit belonged to a single large batch of prisoners from the Daoudi tribal area along the Awa Spi river in southern Germian. All of them were captured in the initial stages of the Third Anfal by army units operating out of Tuz Khurmatu, and all of them were brought to Tikrit after first being detained at the Tuz Khurmatu Youth Hall (see above, pp.159).  It seems reasonable to surmise, then, that Tikrit was pressed into service as a temporary overflow center for a few days in mid-April, when the Third Anfal was in full swing in Germian and Topzawa was filled to capacity. As at Topzawa, the guards were identified as regular army troops, with Amn and Istikhbarat agents also in attendance. But one man also said that he recognized members of the Popular Army (Jaysh al-Sha'abi).  Conditions at Tikrit were extremely brutal. According to the account of Muhammad, a man from the village of Talau who was aged 63 at the time of Anfal:  On the first morning, they separated the men into small groups and beat them. Four soldiers would beat one captive; the other prisoners could see this. About fifteen or twenty men were in each group that was taken a little way off to be kicked and beaten with sticks and [coaxial] cables. They were taken away in the early morning and returned in the afternoon. The soldiers did not gather the men by name, but just pointed, 'you, and you' and so on. They were Amn from Tikrit and Kirkuk; butchers, we know them.17 When one group of beaten men returned, they took another and beat them. That night, I was in a group of ten or twelve men that was taken out and blindfolded, with our hands tied behind us. They took us in three or four cars to somewhere in Tikrit. We drove around all night, barely stopping. They asked meno questions. The captured men could not talk to each other. Everyone was thinking of his own destiny. Of the ten or twelve they took out that night, only five returned. The next night, when I was back in the hall, Amn came and asked for men to volunteer for the war against Iran. Eighty men volunteered. But it was a lie; they disappeared. A committee was set up by Amn to process the prisoners, who were ordered to squat while the Amn agents took all their money and put it in a big sack. They also took all our documents. The Amn agents were shouting at us to scare us. 'Bring weapons to kill them,' said one. 'They are poor, don't shoot them,' said another. And another: 'I wish we had killed all of them. 'Later that night the Amn came back and took all the young men away. Only the elderly remained. The young men were taken away in Nissan buses, ten or more of them, each with a capacity of forty-five people. Their documents had already been taken; they left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.  Among the young men who disappeared that night were Muhammad's son Salah, his brother's son, and several other relatives. 'I never heard from them again,' he concluded. 'There were no messages, nothing. No one ever saw them again. Only Saddam Hussein knows.'18  * * *   The Prisoners from Bileh and Halabja   The treatment of those captured in other phases of the Anfal campaign appears to have been slightly different. During April and early May 1988, Topzawa was processing Anfal victims on what can only be described as an industrial scale. But by the end of May, when Anfal reached the areas north of Dukan Lake, the rules had changed somewhat. Middle East Watch interviewed some three dozen former inmatesof Topzawa. Of these, five were from the areas affected by the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Anfals. Four were from Upper and Lower Bileh; the other was a young woman named Amina, from the nearby village of Akoyan.19 These witnesses reported being held apart from the other prisoners. Almost the entire group was from Bileh, although they also recognized a handful of people from nearby Kandour--the village whose residents had shown such kindness to the victims of the May 1987 chemical attack on the Malakan Valley. All of them had been brought here after a few days in the army fort at Spielk, near Khalifan. One man told of an additional night in an underground cell at the Amn headquarters in Kirkuk; several others reported an overnight stay in Erbil.  The Bileh group was apparently held at Topzawa for eight to ten days, considerably longer than most of the detainees from earlier periods. Their conditions also seem to have been marginally less harsh, and the women were able to take water and cigarettes to their husbands, who were detained in a separate large cell. After a week or so the women and children were transferred, like their predecessors, to another army base at Dibs. Most of the elderly were driven south to the prison at Nugra Salman, although one old man was taken directly from Topzawa to Arbat, a town to the south of the city of Suleimaniyeh. This was in mid-June. From Arbat, he made his own way to Basirma, a government-controlled complex that had been set up after the chemical attacks on the Balisan Valley in April 1987.  An even more notable exception to the earlier pattern of detentions was the case of Faraj, a 39-year old teacher from Halabja. His testimony shows again how survivors from that town were treated differently from those who were swept up in Anfal. It also demonstrates that Topzawa remained in operation until the very end of the campaign. Faraj had fled to Iran with his wife and two of his six children immediately after the March 16 chemical attack. After two and a half months in Iranian hospitals and refugee camps, the family crossed back into Iraq, but they were soon picked up by soldiers at a checkpoint in Ranya. After a period of interrogation by Amn agents in Suleimaniyeh,Faraj and his family were transferred to Topzawa in a bus that contained twenty-five people from Halabja and the Kalar area.20  The conditions that Faraj observed in Topzawa were broadly similar to what earlier witnesses had described. The sexes were still being segregated on arrival; 150 people or so were crowded into a single large cell; and they existed on starvation rations. But there was now a Kurdish army doctor in attendance, a man named Najib, who hailed from Khanaqin. Faraj became aware that all of his fellow-prisoners were from Halabja, and that many of them had not fled to Iran as he did, but had been captured inside Iraqi Kurdistan after the bombing of the city.  At night, he heard the sound of weeping from other parts of the building, and asked a guard what was going on. 'Those are the Anfal prisoners,' the guard replied, 'and they are leaving the prison.' Halabja, in other words, was not part of the Anfal operation. 'Where are the Anfal prisoners being taken?' Faraj asked another guard the next morning. 'That is none of your concern,' the man answered. 'If you ask that question again, you will be sent off with them too, to be lost forever.'  From eavesdropping on their conversations, Faraj, who could speak Arabic, learned that the Topzawa guards had all been posted here from Baghdad. One of them even gave the prisoner his telephone number, and suggested that he call if he was ever in the capital to see if 'we may have a job for you.' Later, the same guard aroused the teacher's suspicions further when he gave him a letter which he said was from a Kurdish girl in another section of the prison, telling her relatives in the men's cells about her failing health and her fears of death. Faraj refused to get involved. Some time later his suspicions about the guard were confirmed when the man told him point-blank that Amn was interested in having him spy on his fellow Kurds.  Amn's clumsy attempts to recruit Faraj may partially explain the leniency that was shown to him, although it is clear from his testimony that Halabja survivors were treated more indulgently than the Anfal prisoners. For the first two weeks, Faraj was even allowed brief visits tohis wife, although those privileges were withdrawn when another prisoner was caught trying to escape through a hole in the ceiling. To discourage any further thoughts of flight, guards beat the man to death in front of his fellow inmates. The Halabja teacher remained in Topzawa for fifty-two days altogether--a much longer period of confinement than any other surviving witness has described. He was eventually released shortly after the end of the Iran-Iraq War and resettled in the Bayinjan complex, between Suleimaniyeh and Chamchamal.21  * * *   The Women's Prison at Dibs   Karim, a 20-year old technology student from Dibs, had been aware for some time of unusual troop movements on the outskirts of town, close to the junction with the Kirkuk-Mosul highway.22 Residents of Dibs had seen civilian buses and coasters approaching from the direction of Kirkuk, and converging on the Dibs army base--a so-called 'Fighting School' where Iraqi commando forces (Maghawir) were trained. They had also seen sealed green police buses leaving the base, accompanied by armed men in olive fatigues. Local shopkeepers grew accustomed to visits from groups of six or seven female prisoners, accompanied by guards, and soon learned that they came from the Dibs base.  These women, and their children, were being transported from Topzawa to Dibs in large numbers from mid-April onwards, part of the three-way segregation process that took their elderly relatives off to the prison of Nugra Salman and their menfolk off, stripped to their shorts, handcuffed and blindfolded, to an unknown destination. One of the Dibsguards told a newcomer that the camp--two buildings within a single compound--held 7,000 Kurdish prisoners. On arrival, some of the women found themselves reunited with the children who had been plucked from their arms by the guards at Topzawa. They would remain at Dibs for between four and five months, until the Iraqi regime declared its final victory over the peshmerga and announced a general amnesty for the Kurds.  The women were tormented by not knowing what had become of their husbands, brothers and fathers. Yet after the abysmal conditions at Topzawa, Dibs offered significant relief. There was room to stretch out and sleep on the filthy concrete floor, and there were no restrictions on the use of the bathrooms. Water was readily available from a faucet. The food was bad, but it was at least more regular--lentil soup and hard pita bread (samoun) or rice, twice or three times a day. After a few weeks, there was even a little added variety in the diet. By the time that Amina, the young woman from Akoyan, arrived in June, the rations at Dibs included two eggs a week, yogurt and tea, and toward the end even a little watermelon. The guards sold soap, tea and sugar to those women who still had money, and the authorities provided one blanket for every seven prisoners. The women were allowed to do their washing in the prison courtyard, sit under trees in the shade or even sleep outdoors if the heat inside was oppressive. At least some were allowed out into the town under guard to shop. One woman who was pregnant when she arrived at Dibs was taken (albeit under military guard) to a hospital in the town, where her delivery was attended by a Kurdish woman doctor. Another said that doctors visited the base twice a week, dispensing shots and tablets, although other witnesses disputed this.  Yet for all these comparative advantages, Dibs was also a regime of unremitting horror. Ironically, the inmates found that the base was run by a fellow Kurd, a man from the Erbil area named Haji Ahmad Fatah who had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Children who were old enough to do manual labor were forced by the guards to sweep out the halls and clean the bathrooms. 'We were guarded by Amn, Istikhbarat and Ba'ath Party people,' recalled a 14-year old boy who spent five months at the Dibs base. 'They were always coming and beating the prisoners without any reason. They tied up my hands and beat me several times. Three Amn agents beat me with a stick on my back and legs. Twice they kept me tied up without food for a whole day for no reason, inside thehall where I slept, from morning until night. I could not ask why. It was impossible for anyone to intervene in Ba'ath rules.'23  This child at least survived; many, perhaps hundreds, did not. There were few fatalities at first, but the rate increased as spring gave way to the heat of summer. Amina, the woman from Akoyan, had given birth to a baby daughter in Dibs, but within two months the child sickened and died. Four or five children died from Bileh alone. Nabat, a 28-year old mother from Qader Karam, lost two of her infant children within a month of each other. Her three-year old daughter Sharo died first; a month later, it was the turn of her two-year old son Diar. 'They died of fear,' Nabat said. 'They were scared, got sick and died. They had diarrhea and were vomiting.'24 Sherzad, a boy of fourteen, counted seven infant deaths at Dibs in a single night. Muhammad, a boy of nine, estimated that there were fifty deaths in his family's large cell during the five months of their captivity; most were small children, but some older women also died. Habiba, who was eight at the time of Anfal, recalled being forced to sleep among dead bodies before guards came to remove them.25  The emaciated bodies of Nabat's two children, Sharo and Diar, were taken away by two guards from the Popular Army, who washed the bodies and interred them in the town's Gumbat Cemetery as Nabat watched. Other infant corpses were simply dumped at the town's Old Mosque, according to Karim, the 20-year old student who had watched the Dibs commando base fill up with prisoners earlier that spring. Townspeople would come to the mosque to wash the bodies, and young men from the locality--including Karim himself--would dig the burial plots in an old, abandoned children's cemetery just over a mile away. Karim helped bury four infants, and between them his friends buried at least fifty, all of them less than a year old. The people of Dibs markedoff a special plot for the new arrivals, and each of the tiny graves was marked.26  At regular intervals, sealed buses would drive up to the Dibs base and carry off large numbers of prisoners. On at least two occasions, these groups were made up of people from the Kalar area of southern Germian--some five hundred women and children in all, according to one estimate--and they were transported to the prison at Nugra Salman, for reasons that remain obscure.27 (See below p.304.) But thousands of others--perhaps half the total population of Dibs--were driven off to other, unknown destinations and vanished into the darkness of Anfal. Sherin, for example, a 23-year old woman from the village of Qeitoul Rasha (nahya of Qader Karam), lost two of her young nieces in this way: Perjin Ja'far Hassan, aged 12, and her younger sister Nabat. Given that the survivors of Anfal were eventually resettled in complexes that corresponded to their places of origin, and that five years have now passed without a word of news, the strong presumption must be that these two girls, and the thousands who vanished from Dibs with them, were murdered by the Iraqi authorities.28  A Prison Camp for the Elderly   'If you know about hell, this is hell. We have seen it.' --Muhammad Hussein Muhammad (b.1912), a survivor of Nugra Salman. While the trucks and buses drove north to Dibs, others headed south from Topzawa and Tikrit, through Iraq's Arab heartland and then further south still, into the vast deserts that stretch toward the Saudi border, until at last they reached the abandoned fortress prison of Nugra Salman--the 'Pit of Salman.' The prisoners came in four main batches, and the total population of Nugra Salman during Anfal appears to have been somewhere between 6,000 and 8,000.29 The first to arrive were thousands of captured villagers from Qara Dagh and Germian (Second and Third Anfals), aged from about fifty to ninety, who came in huge caravans of sealed buses in mid-April, 1988. Next, in early May, a somewhat smaller number of elderly people arrived from the valley of the Lesser Zab (Fourth Anfal). Third, over the course of the summer, several busloads of women and children from southern Germian were transferred from the prison at Dibs, to be housed in separate quarters at Nugra Salman. Finally, in late August, just a few days before the military declared a formal end to its Anfal campaign, several hundred returning refugees from the gas attack on Halabja were brought to Nugra Salman, having surrendered to the Iraqi Army as they crossed the border from Iran. According to some reports, the Halabja contingent was of all ages, and may even have included some young men.30  One of the Halabja survivors was a 33-year old woman named Urfiya. One of her five children had died on the road to Iran after the bombing. With the other four, Urfiya crossed the border and spent five months in the Iranian camps. On August 23, she recalled, the Iranians bussed some 2,000 Halabja families back to the border. The Iraqi Army was waiting for them, and took them in military trucks to Suleimaniyeh, where the Emergency Forces held them on a bread-and-water diet for five days. The place where they were confined, said Urfiya, was 'full of people from Qara Dagh.' At the end of this time, the young men were separated from their families and driven off in vehicles that resembled ambulances, painted white or green with a single tiny window in the rear. They have never been seen again. The women and children and the elderly were crammed into civilian buses and driven via Kirkuk, Tikrit, Baghdad and Samawa to Nugra Salman, arriving there on August 29.31  * * *   The journey from the outskirts of Kirkuk to Nugra Salman took between twelve and fifteen hours, with fifty or sixty prisoners crammed into windowless buses designed to hold half that number. At the head and tail of each convoy, Amn and Istikhbarat agents rode in cars with walkie-talkie radios. Some convoys moved off early in the morning and arrived at Nugra Salman late the same evening. Others left in darkness and drove all night. By guessing at the time and direction, or by peering out of the rear door if it was left open a crack for air, the prisoners could tell when they passed through a city--first Tikrit, several hours later Baghdad, and then finally Samawa. They could hear sirens wailing and glimpse curious Arab crowds lining the streets to watch the sealed vehicles go past with their human cargo. There were no stops; the detainees weregiven no food or water, and the presence of guards with Kalashnikovs silenced any complaint.  At Samawa, the elderly prisoners sometimes became aware that the convoys were dividing into two; while their vehicles continued to head south, others peeled off in a different direction. These were the buses that carried the younger Kurdish prisoners from Topzawa, and they were never seen again. After Samawa, there was nothing but barren desert, dotted with the rubble of destroyed settlements--'like our villages, flattened by bulldozers,' said one woman.32 Three hours to the southwest of Samawa, the table-land dropped away sharply, and there in the depression below, visible only at the last moment, lay the town of Al-Salman. And a mile and a quarter away in the desert, surrounded by a barbed-wire perimeter fence and guarded by watch towers at each corner, was the prison of Nugra Salman itself.  The buses entered through one of the two large gates and came to a rest in a huge central courtyard, 'three times as long as the soccer field at Suleimaniyeh.'33 The first arrivals from Topzawa in mid-April found Nugra Salman dark and empty. It was an old building, dating back to the days of the Iraqi monarchy and perhaps even earlier.34 It had been abandoned for years, used by Arab nomads to shelter their herds. The bare walls were scrawled with the diaries of political prisoners. On the door of one cell, a guard had daubed 'Khomeini eats shit.' Over the main gate, someone else had written 'Welcome to Hell.' Over the rear entrance, another sign read: 'It is rare for anyone to survive three months in this place.'  Whatever interrogation the Iraqi authorities deemed necessary for these elderly and infirm victims of Anfal had already been carried out at Topzawa. Here, at Nugra Salman, there was only a quick registration of name, occupation and place of residence, accompanied by jeers and threats from the guards. 'You are here to die,' said one, 'on the orders of Saddam Hussein and Ali Hassan al-Majid.' With this, the new arrivalswere shoved into the cells, or halls, that filled both stories of the prison. These bare rooms varied greatly in size: some of them held only fifty or sixty prisoners, others several hundreds.35 The doors were locked from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. At other times, the inmates could circulate freely.  The arrival of the first detainees coincided more or less with the beginning of Ramadan on April 17, and during the holy month the food was better than it had been at Topzawa.36 There was rice, vegetable soup, potatoes and tomatoes, even meat and fruit on occasion. Water came from a well, through a standpipe in the yard, though it was hot, salty and bitter--'like snake poison,' said one man. Many inmates believed that the first health crisis at Nugra Salman was connected to drinking this water. The first deaths occurred early in May, soon after the arrival of the second wave of prisoners, those from the valley of the Lesser Zab.  * * *   One of those who arrived in this batch was Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari, the 68-year old village head from Goktapa, who had lost sixteen members of his family in the chemical weapons attack on May 3. During his four months in Nugra Salman, Abd-al-Qader--one of the few literate prisoners and an Arabic speaker to boot--emerged as a naturalleader of the inmates, and his testimony is worth quoting at length here. After the first night at Topzawa,  At 8:30 a.m. a military man came in and announced, 'Prepare yourselves.' We had nothing, we were ready, we had nothing to pack. They told us to leave the room. We noticed 150 or 200 vehicles waiting in two groups, like ambulances, but green.37 These could only take ten people, but they put twenty-seven in ours. There were two doors: a small narrow one which only the guard could enter, and a second door through which they pushed us. It was very hot, but they closed the door and locked it. In our car there were only elderly people.  After an hour or an hour and a half, we called for water. I told them in Arabic, 'We are thirsty; give us water.' --'Water is forbidden for you, it is not allowed.' After a while, one friend wanted to get out and relieve himself. I informed the soldier. 'It is not allowed for you,' he said. After ten minutes the man could not hold himself any longer and we smelled a bad smell in the car. Five fainted from the smell and the heat. We wished for death. Nothing was allowed to us. All the men took their clothes off because of the heat, wearing only their shorts. The car went on moving and we did not know where it was going.  One and a half hours before nightfall we arrived at a fort and got out. It was deserted. They took us into a long yard, with soldiers and police all around. More cars were arriving and emptying out men and women. The number reached 400. They brought water in buckets without any glasses. We were like cows, putting our heads down to get the water at once, three at a timedrinking from the bucket. The water was hot, the temperature to wash with, and it was salty.  [After registration] a guard asked for newcomers and told them to go with him. It was fifteen minutes before dark. We went to the second floor and they put sixty-four of us into one room, about eight meters by six. I objected: 'We are not animals to be crowded all in one room. How can we sleep and eat.' The man in charge answered, 'Shut up. This is what we prepared for you.' After three minutes he left and another came to the door with a sack on his shoulder. It was a prisoner. He said, 'Brothers, we know you were not given anything because you are newcomers. We brought our shares for you tonight. Take this bread, since they will not give you any food until the morning.'  In the morning a prisoner from another hall came and recruited four of us to go with him to get the bread rations for the cell. After twenty minutes the four men came back with three sacks of bread. Each prisoner got three samoun for the entire day, breakfast, lunch and dinner.38 The bread was not made from wheat but from zorat [a coarse grain normally used as animal feed].  * * *   Deaths at Nugra Salman   The Ramadan rations were now a thing of the past, and on the new starvation diet of bread and contaminated water, the conditions at Nugra Salman deteriorated sharply. The prisoners were fatigued and infested by lice. By late May there was a steady stream of deaths, some days three, some six or seven, and sometimes as many as a dozen. Abd-al-Qader tried his best to keep count of the deaths. By early September, when he was finally released, he had tallied 517--victims of the inhuman conditions at Nugra Salman and the depraved indifference of the Iraqi authorities. Later, after his release, he heard that another forty-five had died over two successive nights in September.  Abd-al-Qader's figures, which suggest an average of four or five deaths a day during the period of his imprisonment from starvation, disease and physical abuse, are extremely credible. Certainly they bear out the more impressionistic estimates given by many other witnesses. The additional forty-five deaths may have been connected with an epidemic that some survivors say broke out after the arrival of the returned refugees from Halabja at the end of August 1988. This outbreak prompted the arrival of a dozen white-coated doctors from Samawa, who advised the prisoners to stop drinking the water.  The authorities at Nugra Salman appear to have responded to the steady stream of fatalities in two ways. The first was to arrange for a daily delivery of water by tanker truck from Samawa; the second was for the guards to initiate a petty extortion racket, selling food at grossly inflated prices to those prisoners who had managed to make it through Topzawa with some cash still in their pockets.  The tanker usually came from Samawa twice a day, although sometimes it missed a day altogether. When the water arrived, there was pandemonium as the prisoners rushed the truck. They were allowed only a few minutes to fill their pitchers, struggling for access to the plastic hosepipe as the guards taunted them, allowing the precious fluid to splash on to the ground and lashing out at people randomly with sticks and strips of coaxial cable. Sensing easy money, the truck driver took to selling the prisoners buckets of water for four dinars ($12) each. Later, he also offered to bring canned milk and meat, lentils, tomato paste and soap.  The driver's example was quickly taken up by the guards, who were from Amn, according to some witnesses, or from Istikhbarat, according to others. A cup of rice was one dinar. Cigarettes were three dinars ($9) a pack. Tomato juice in cans past their expiry date cost twelve ($36). According to Abd-al-Qader:  We told the prisoners in charge of the food to speak to the guards to find a way to get rid of the bad food and get sugar and tea, even if we had to buy them, becausethe deaths were very bad. They managed to get sugar, tea and oil with our money. The food came secretly at night. They sold us tomato paste for four dinars, in cans which were priced for sale by the government at six dirhams.39 We paid eighty dinars for a sack of sugar and seventy dinars for a sack of rice--official price, eleven dinars.  The first thing we got was the tomato paste. We managed to borrow a pot from a cell whose prisoners had been there longer than us, and we cooked food in it. We put our bread into the tomato paste soup and absorbed all the liquid. This was really like a feast to us.  But the effects of this black market were short-lived, other than for the lucky few who had managed to keep money back after Topzawa. The prisoners grew weaker, scarcely able to take advantage of the brief afternoon exercise period, when they were allowed to mingle in the central courtyard. The deaths continued, and among the dead were some of the children who had been newly transferred to Nugra Salman from Dibs.  The dead were not permitted the dignity of a decent burial. Indeed, they were often not even moved from the spot where they died, but left there for as long as three days to rot in the summer heat. This was evidently a matter of deliberate policy. 'After a few weeks,' one woman recalled, 'my husband died in my arms. He had gotten extremely weak and thin and he had been badly beaten by the prison guards. My husband's body lay in the prison hall for one day. The guards did not let me bury him and I had to beg them; the guard said the body had to remain in the prison until it rotted.'40  Eventually Amn agents would register the names of the dead, strip them of any remaining money and valuables and order the corpses to be stuffed into sacks and loaded onto handcarts of the sort normally used forgarbage disposal. The theft of money in particular infuriated Abd-al-Qader:  One man died with 400 dinars [$1,200] on him. An Amn man came, took the money, kissed it, and said this was for the government. I insulted the prisoners about this, telling them, 'You are not animals! Anything that the dead relatives leave is yours. Do not leave it for others. Use it, you need it.' -- 'What else could we do?' they answered. 'We are afraid.' -- 'Inside this building, nothing can be sent to you from the outside,' I told them. 'You cannot live without that money. You may be afraid of God, but God will not punish you, I assure you. I will answer for you on the Day of Judgment.' They followed my advice. From then on, they left only one dinar or a half dinar in the pockets of the dead for the guards. The guards came two or three times, but when they found such small amounts they abandoned the search.  The prisoners tried as best they could to wash the bodies and prepare them for burial according to Islamic doctrine. At first, if there was money, the tanker driver from Samawa might be persuaded to bring a shroud. But when the money ran out, the only shroud available was the dead person's Kurdish headscarf (jamadani) or one of the scarce prison blankets. Groups of prisoners--at least two, sometimes four or six men, weakened and fatigued by hunger--would be assembled to carry the corpse away, while prison guards kicked and punched them to hurry the process along, shouting epithets all the while. 'You are saboteurs, and you deserve to die like dogs,' one guard shouted.  A ten-minute trudge through the stony desert brought them to the gravesite, which lay a few hundred yards to the east of the prison. It comprised a series of long trenches, no more than a meter deep, dug by bulldozers. There were no markers, although the mourners tried when they could to mark the spot with stones. The bodies were laid roughly inside and dirt tossed over them. The guards allowed no time for prayers for the dead. When thirty or forty corpses filled a trench, the bulldozerwould smooth it over to remove all traces and proceed to dig another.41  When the burial party returned the next day, broken limbs and bloody rags would be strewn around, for during the night the freshly turned gravesite attracted packs of wild desert dogs. The guards were terrified by these animals, believing that they became rabid after eating human flesh, and shot at any they could see. But few of the remains of those who died at Nugra Salman were allowed to rest in peace. 'Go bury the bodies for the dogs,' the guards would taunt the survivors.  * * *   The man who presided over this cruel regime was named Hajjaj, an Amn lieutenant by most accounts.42 Hajjaj was a feared and detested figure, described by one witness as a 'bald, husky young man' from Amn headquarters in Baghdad, who drove a red Volkswagen Passat manufactured in Brazil. His deputy was a man called Shamkhi. An uncle of Lt. Hajjaj, one Khalaf, was one of the guards.  Hajjaj and his associates were notorious for beating prisoners on the slightest pretext, or on none at all. One man in his sixties was beaten for requesting a light bulb. 'Go to [PUK leader Jalal] Talabani for bulbs,' a guard told him mockingly.43 Another inmate, weakened by hunger, fell asleep one day when Hajjaj was in his cell. 'He slapped me right away,' the man recalled, 'and said, 'You shall never sleep in mypresence.' Then he made me go and sit in the place where the garbage was kept.'44 Age and gender offered no protection. 'Is this child a peshmerga?,' the same man asked a guard one day. 'Is this woman?' --'Yes, they are,' the guard answered. 'They are all peshmerga and they are criminals.' On another occasion, Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari saw Hajjaj kicking a group of young women who had recently arrived from Dibs and hitting them with a length of plastic tubing.45  Hajjaj also punished prisoners by forcing them to crawl on their bellies. If the result was not to his liking, a guard would stamp on the small of the prisoner's back to force him lower. But the punishment most favored by Hajjaj, according to many accounts, was to expose prisoners to the blazing midday sun. Men, women and children alike were subjected to this treatment, even if they were too weak to walk and had to be dragged to the spot. The prisoners would be forced to squat with their heads lowered, normally for two hours. Any movement would be punished with a beating. A variant on this routine was to tie the prisoner to a metal post in the sun. There were nine of these posts sunk in concrete in the central courtyard at Nugra Salman, each taller than a person and thicker than an electricity pole.46 Some prisoners were reportedly suspended upside down from the posts, tied at the feet by their Kurdish cummerbund, and with their unbound hands barely clearing the ground.  The inmates of Nugra Salman had to endure Lt. Hajjaj's brutal custody until September 6, when the general amnesty allowed them to go free--but not to go home.  ______   1 The Popular Army (Jaysh al-Sha'abi) was founded in 1970 as a party-controlled militia which would provide Ba'ath cadre with basic military training and act as a counterweight to the regular armed forces. Despite its nominal strength of 250,000 the Popular Army was largely ineffective as a combat force in the Iran-Iraq war; its most important role was to guard buildings in the cities during the absence of the regular army.  2 Amn Suleimaniyeh to Amn Autonomous Region Headquarters, letter no. 25163 of October 29, 1988. Unfortunately, no time period is indicated, making it impossible to extrapolate from these numbers to estimate the total of those who passed through Topzawa during the Anfal campaign.  3 Middle East Watch interview with Abd-al-Qader Abdullah Askari, Goktapa, May 24, 1992.  4 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.  5 These officers may have been from Istikhbarat, given the demonstrated role of military intelligence in overseeing the initial transit camps. See above p.109. But they may equally well have been from Amn, which uses the same ranks as the military.

Middle East Watch has found many examples of this form among official files. The only unusual feature of the questioning described at Topzawa is the asking of the mother's name; under standard procedures only the father's name was requested.  9 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, September 12, 1992. One survivor did recall a more extensive interrogation, in which he was asked not only whether he was a peshmerga, but to which party he belonged, whether he knew any peshmerga, whether he had relatives who were peshmerga, whether he had any relatives living abroad, whether he had any relatives who had been executed, and whether he was an army deserter. Middle East Watch interview, Shoresh complex, July 1, 1992. Both of these men were among the handful of execution survivors located by Middle East Watch. For their full stories, see below, chapter 9.  10 Middle East Watch interview with a survivor from the Jabari village of Mahmoud Parizad, Shoresh complex, May 9, 1992.  11 Taymour has been interviewed many times by journalists and human rights delegations visiting Iraqi Kurdistan. See, for example, Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, Unquiet Graves: The Search for the Disappeared in Iraqi Kurdistan, February 1992; Taymour is also the subject of a chapter in Kanan Makiya's book, Cruelty and Silence, pp.151-199.  12 Middle East Watch interview with Taymour Abdullah Ahmad, Sumoud complex, July 29, 1992.  13 After Topzawa, Abd-al-Qader never again saw his two sons, Omed and Latif, or his daughter-in-law, Fahima. Middle East Watch interview, May 24, 1992.  14 A letter from Amn Shaqlawa, ref. Research/11408, and dated December 31, 1987, refers to a Northern Bureau directive of December 13, 1987, to the effect that, 'It is completely prohibited for bearded people to have access to the center of the governorates and other towns for any reason whatsoever, unless permitted by the proper authorities.'  15 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.  16 Middle East Watch interview, Benaslawa complex, April 19, 1992.  17 Most members of Amn are drawn from Ramadi, Tikrit and Samarra, a triangle of Sunni-dominated towns west of Baghdad, the heartland of Saddam Hussein's political support.  18 Middle East Watch interview, Daratou complex, April 18, 1992.  19 Middle East Watch interviews, Ramhawej village, July 18, 1992, Rawanduz, May 5, 1992, Khalifan and Basirma complex, March 24, 1993.  20 The nahya of Kalar in southern Germian was included in the third stage of Anfal. Thousands of villagers from the Kalar area were brought to Topzawa in early and mid-April, but this is the only case reported to Middle East Watch of their being taken there any later. The witness offered no explanation of what had happened to them during the three months since the Third Anfal. Middle East Watch interview, Halabja, May 8, 1992.  21 The supposition must be that Faraj was released under the general amnesty of September 6, 1988. By this reckoning, he would have been brought from Suleimaniyeh to Topzawa on or about July 16. The Bayinjan complex was used to resettle the survivors of several phases of Anfal. Two other testimonies suggest that its other main purpose was to rehouse returning refugees from the Halabja attack.

Neither the Gumbat Cemetery nor the old children's cemetery was therefore accessible to Middle East Watch for an independent forensic examination.  27 Middle East Watch interview with a woman from Omerbel village, Kifri, March 30, 1993.  28 Middle East Watch interview, Shoresh complex, June 29, 1992. The witness's nieces were from the Gulbagh Valley, from which, it may be recalled, a significant number of women were reported to have disappeared.  29 These figures are based on interviews with twenty-one former inmates of Nugra Salman, as well as a former Iraqi military officer with first-hand experience of the prison. The interviews included seventeen men, ranging in age from forty-five to eighty-three, and four women, aged from fifty to sixty. Asked to estimate the total prison population, a dozen witnesses gave figures ranging from 5,000 to 11,000. Two gave much higher figures, which we have discounted. With the exception of deaths and new arrivals, the population of Nugra Salman remained stable until the general amnesty of September 6, 1988.  30 One witness also told of a number of Arab prisoners being held in the basement of Nugra Salman, wearing distinctive white disdashas; this could not be corroborated in other interviews.  31 Middle East Watch interview, Zarayen complex, July 28, 1992. Anfal, of course, cannot explain the disappearances of these young men from Suleimaniyeh, since Halabja was not included in the operation. Their disappearance may be taken, rather, as part of the routine practice of terror by the Iraqi security forces. Later press reports suggest that some younger people from Halabja may also have been disappeared from Nugra Salman. 'Halabja Wounds Still Open Years After Gas Attack,' (Reuter's, March 7, 1993), cites the case of one woman from Halabja who has not seen her four children, aged 10-24, since they were interned there.  32 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, April 23, 1992.  33 Middle East Watch interview, Ja'faran, Qara Dagh, May 11, 1992.  34 The Iraqi monarchy was overthrown in a military coup on July 14, 1958. Its main architect was Brigadier Abd-al-Karim Qasem, who subsequently became Prime Minister.  35 There are persistent, if somewhat contradictory, reports of a basement level at Nugra Salman, from which the sound of weeping and screams could be heard. A former Iraqi infantry officer who visited the prison before Anfal said that this basement was entered through a heavy barred trapdoor with a double lock. The space beneath was approximately two meters high--just enough for a prisoner to stand up. The officer also described a punishment cell at Nugra Salman, built 'like a bird cage, with only enough room to sit down.' Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, April 26, 1992.  36 Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, is a time of fasting from sunrise to sunset. After sunset, meals tend to be more lavish than at other times, and the rations given to the inmates of Nugra Salman--assuming they were intended to be eaten in the evening--may be taken as a sign of relative lenience by the authorities toward the elderly. (By the same token, of course, if these foods were offered during daylight hours, they could be construed as a mockery, or a temptation of the Kurds' Muslim faith. The context, however, seems to make this explanation unlikely.)  37 Although Abd-al-Qader's estimate of numbers here may be high, his figures in general appeared to be unusually reliable, especially where the numbers of deaths at Nugra Salman were concerned. See p.232.  38 Other witnesses said that the ration was only two samoun a day--one at 10:00 a.m. and the other at 10:00 p.m. It may be that this varied from time to time.  39 The dinar is made up of 1,000 fils; 50 fils are one dirham, and 20 dirhams one dinar.  40 Middle East Watch interview with a woman from Qala village (nahya Naujul), Benaslawa complex, April 20, 1992.  41 The only exception to this harsh behavior was if the guard was a Shi'a Muslim; witnesses described the Shi'a (including even Shi'a military officers commanding troops during Anfal operations) as having shown the Kurds numerous small kindnesses.  42 One witness queried this, and thought Lt. Hajjaj was an army officer. The same witness identified the 'head of the prison' as a man named Sa'id Hama, but was unable to specify to which agency he belonged. There was a general and understandable confusion among witnesses when it came to identifying particular government agencies by their uniforms or other visible signs. At Nugra Salman, as at Topzawa and the earlier processing centers, witnesses variously identified their oppressors as being from Amn, Istikhbarat, the regular army and police.  43 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, April 23, 1992.  44 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.  45 One even more lurid account spoke of a large group of single women being kept apart from the other prisoners and regularly raped by Amn agents. One of these women reportedly killed herself with a knife as a result. The rape of female detainees in Iraq has been well substantiated elsewhere, and is even known to have been recorded on videotape. Middle East Watch did not succeed, however, in speaking to any witnesses or victims of rape at Nugra Salman. The Kurds, it should be noted, are reluctant to talk to outsiders about matters involving sexual abuse.  46 The description strongly suggests that one original purpose of these posts would have been for the use of firing squads. Prisoners can be seen tied to similar posts in captured videotapes of the execution of Kurdish prisoners.  9   The Firing Squads 'Hell and Elysium swarm with ghosts of men  That I have sent from sundry foughten fields  To spread my fame through hell and up to heaven.'  --Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great, Part One (V, i)  'It was God's wish.'  -- Mustafa, who escaped a mass execution during Anfal.        Muhammad's Story   At least six people--the youngest a boy of twelve, the eldest a man of thirty-eight with nine children of his own--have survived to tell the truth about what happened to the tens of thousands of Iraqi Kurds who were driven away in the convoys of sealed vehicles from the Popular Army camp at Topzawa. All six were from the Germian area, scene of the Third Anfal.  Muhammad, the 32-year old member of the peshmerga backing force from the village of Aliyani Taza in southern Germian, had arrived with his family at the army fort at Qoratu on about April 16. (see above p.145) They spent three days there before being moved to Topzawa, where Muhammad was separated from his two wives and seven children. None of his family ever returned alive, with the exception of his parents, who survived Nugra Salman.1  Muhammad spent two days in Topzawa. He was not questioned. He was given nothing to eat. On the third day the guards came to his 'hall,' which held about 500 prisoners. They handcuffed the men in pairs and took them to a line of vehicles painted in camouflage colors. Each vehicle held twenty-eight prisoners; Muhammad counted the seats. It wasthe middle of the afternoon when the convoy moved off. They drove for perhaps six hours, but Muhammad quickly lost all sense of direction and had no idea where they were going. All he could tell was that most of the journey was on the paved highway; the final hour was on a bumpy dirt road.  When the convoy eventually stopped, the driver kept the motor running. Over the throb of the engine, Muhammad could hear the sound of gunfire outside. The prisoners were hustled out into the darkness and searched for any identity cards and money that might have been missed earlier. Muhammad lost his last 700 dinars. When the search was completed, the guards removed the handcuffs that bound Muhammad to his neighbor, a man from the village of Babakr, close to Aliyani Taza. In place of the handcuffs, the guards brought a length of string, which they used to tie the twenty-eight prisoners in a single line by their left hands. The men were ordered to stand facing the edge of a freshly dug trench, just long enough to accommodate the twenty-eight bodies as they fell.  The knot binding Muhammad's left hand had been carelessly tied, and he managed to tug it free of his wrist and bolt a moment before the soldiers opened fire. Beyond the trench was an open field, and the springtime grass had grown tall enough to conceal Muhammad from the truck headlights that were now trained in his direction. To his astonishment, the guards did not give chase. Behind him, the clatter of gunfire continued.  Muhammad ran and walked for four days without food, drinking rainwater from puddles along the way. Trying to chart his route by the sun, he set out in what he thought was the direction of Germian, across an endless flat plain planted with wheat and barley. From the clothes of the shepherds he spotted at intervals, he could tell that he was in an Arab area. After four days, so exhausted that he could not walk another step, he stumbled into an Arab village. The people gathered around to stare. 'Look,' they said, 'it is a Kurd who has fallen out of an airplane.'  The remainder of Muhammad's odyssey is too long to recount in detail here. Imprisoned and beaten by the Arab villagers, handed over to the police, interrogated, taken to Mosul, jailed again, transferred to the Kirkuk police and then to Suleimaniyeh, to Kalar and back once more to Suleimaniyeh, amnestied and finally inducted into the army. Miraculously, the police believed his story--which he never varied--that he was a member of the jahsh of Fatah Beg, the mustashar from Kalar. The ordinary Iraqi police, who were almost certainly not privy to the truthabout the Anfal mass executions, never realized that they were dealing with an Anfalaki. Amn, which would certainly have pressed the matter further, was never brought in to elucidate Muhammad's case. The man was truly blessed with a talent for survival.  * * *   Ozer, Omar and Ibrahim   Remarkably, four of the other five survivors of the Anfal firing squads travelled together to their execution site as part of a single convoy. Three of them were even in the same vehicle--although one of the three did not know the others, and has not met them since. It is possible, then, to reconstruct their composite story in considerable detail.  Ozer, the young man who had spent his last night at Topzawa shivering with cold as he listened to revving bus engines and contemplated the pools of diesel oil and fresh blood on a cement floor, was perhaps the most articulate of these witnesses. Ozer was twenty-five at the time of Anfal, an unmarried construction worker who had seen action in the war against Iran and deserted several times from the Iraqi Army. He had been born not ten miles from Topzawa, in the village of Tarjil, on the main road between Kirkuk and the nahya of Leilan. But he had moved around a lot before settling in nearby Jafan, a tiny hamlet of just seventeen houses. There he stayed until April 1987, when the army attacked and burned the village. This time Ozer moved to Khidr Reihan, a peaceful village two and a half hours on foot from the nahya of Qader Karam that was home to several other deserters and draft dodgers.  Like so many others, Ozer took to the hills when the Third Anfal approached his home on about April 10. Hearing the rumor of a temporary amnesty in Qader Karam, he was one of the thousands who surrendered to the jahsh forces commanded by Qasem Agha, the one-eyed mustashar from Koysinjaq. Over the next few days, Ozer passed through the Qader Karam police station and the army brigade headquarters in Chamchamal. The truck that took him from there to the local office of Amn was part of the convoy that was caught up in the attempted revolt of the townspeople of Chamchamal. But Ozer was not one of those they succeeded in rescuing, and finally, on April 14, he arrived at Topzawa.  At this stage, Ozer met up with an acquaintance whom we shall call Omar, a 22-year old draft dodger who had also fled from Jafan the previous year and resettled in Khidr Reihan. Omar had fled to the hills when Anfal began, and surrendered to Qasem Agha's men two days after Ozer. From Chamchamal, they were trucked together to Topzawa, where most of their cellmates were strangers. But two of these men were destined to share with Ozer and Omar what was intended to be their final journey.  Both of them were draft dodgers from peshmerga-controlled villages in the nahya of Qader Karam. The elder of the two was 'Mustafa,' a 38-year old resident of Top Khana; the other, 'Ibrahim,' was a 23-year old father of four from Kani Qader Khwaru. Neither man was an active fighter, but Ibrahim had carried an Iranian-made Kalashnikov rifle as a member of the civilian 'backing force,' and was a friend or blood relative of most of the peshmerga who had died in the army's bloody assault on the PUK base at Tazashar, at the opening of the Third Anfal campaign. Like Ozer and Omar, both Mustafa and Ibrahim had been fooled by the phony offer of a three-day amnesty in Qader Karam. Mustafa had turned himself in to the jahsh led by Sheikh Mu'tassem; Ibrahim had surrendered to the forces of the mustashar Raf'at Gilli. Both men had passed through the first-stage collection facility at Aliawa.  The testimonies of these four men contain some minor discrepancies over dates. But at some point between April 15 and April 17 (the first day of the holy month of Ramadan), at about 8:00 in the morning, they were hustled, together with hundreds of others, into the prison yard at Topzawa. A caravan of sealed vehicles waited under military guard, with their engines running. They were of two kinds. Some (eighteen, by one count) were windowless police buses, painted green or white, and Ozer, Ibrahim and Omar were shoved into one of these. Ozer had time to notice that it had a Mosul registration; its license plate read 'Nineveh Police,' and the number was 5036 or 5037. Mustafa traveled in a second type of vehicle, which resembled a large ambulance or covered truck. The smaller police buses held thirty-four or thirty-five people each, in forward-facing rows two abreast, divided by a central aisle. Mustafa's truck held between fifty and sixty prisoners, squashed together on four benches that ran lengthwise along the vehicle.  To the last, it appears that the prisoners were grouped together according to their places of origin. Ozer recognized faces from a number of places in the Leilan-Qader Karam area--Khidr Beg, Qashqa andQarachiwar--as well as two others from his own home village of Khidr Reihan. Everyone in the bus was young, aged from 20-40, Ibrahim recalled. But Ozer thought that some of the men were much older, 'with white beards.'  The inside of the buses was hellish. The vehicle in which Ozer, Ibrahim and Mustafa rode was thick with old urine and human feces. Its previous occupants had scrawled brief messages in Kurdish on the seat-backs: 'To the Saudi border'...'To the Kuwaiti border'...'To Ar'ar.'2 In these smaller buses, the prisoners were separated from the driver's compartment by a padlocked sliding door. The driver himself entered by a separate door on the right of the bus. A military guard rode alongside him, armed with a Kalashnikov with a folding stock and wearing the distinctive uniform of the army's Special Forces (Quwat al-Khaseh)--camouflage fatigues of yellow drab with irregular green splotches and a red beret with the golden insignia of a bird of prey with outstretched wings.  Set into the sliding door that separated the two compartments was a small wire-mesh opening, perhaps six inches square, through which the prisoners closest to the front could see the road ahead and the driver's rear-view mirror. Ozer estimated that his was the thirty-fifth vehicle in the convoy.3 To the front and rear of each bus, he could glimpse pick-up trucks of the sort used by Amn, with mounted machine-guns.  Seated toward the front of the bus was a man named Anwar Tayyar. A dark, stoutly built man, Tayyar was a former peshmerga; he had also worked as a driver, and knew the roads intimately. For this reason, his fellow prisoners asked him to figure out where they were heading. Sneaking glances through the wire grille, Tayyar at first reported that they were following the road to Mosul. There was a gasp of fear,because, as Ibrahim recalled, 'most of the government's killers are in Mosul.'4 The passengers were convinced they were going to die.  Soon, however, the bus swung off the Mosul road and turned to the southwest. 'We have been saved,' said Anwar Tayyar with a sigh of relief. Perhaps, the men speculated, they were merely being transferred to another prison. But the buses drove on, stopping occasionally for a few minutes. At intervals, the men begged the Quwat al-Khaseh guard for water. 'Just a minute,' the man would answer, but the water never arrived. In the airless heat and stench of Mustafa's bus, the prisoners were reduced to drinking their own urine from their shoes.  As the afternoon wore on, Anwar Tayyar began to lose his bearings. 'Samawa!' he exclaimed at one point, but then someone else recognized Falluja, a sizeable town on the Euphrates. Just outside Falluja, Ozer noticed that the convoy was splitting into two parts. The majority of the vehicles continued in a different direction; five, including Ozer's bus and the larger green truck carrying Mustafa, drove due west, into the rapidly approaching sunset. Before long, they passed the larger city of Ramadi to their left. After leaving Ramadi behind them, they continued for at least another fifteen minutes, perhaps as much as a half-hour, on the paved highway, turning right once at a junction to cross a heavily guarded bridge over a river--presumably the Euphrates once more.  At the far end of the bridge, the five vehicles halted. It was now about 6:30 p.m., and ten hours had passed since their departure from Topzawa. Through the wire-mesh screen, the prisoners could see that they had stopped outside a police station, under a clump of date palms. They could hear a conversation between one of their army guards and an officer at the police station. Although the man was addressed as 'sir,' his uniform bore no insignia of rank. It was clear that the guard was transferring the prisoners into this officer's custody. He handed over a list of their names, and told the officer that the vehicles were to remain with the police 'until the mission is completed,' at which time they should be returned.  The drivers and Special Forces guards climbed down from the vehicles at this point. Their replacements were dressed all in green with black berets--a uniform that is characteristic of both Amn and the Ba'ath Party, as well as the regular Iraqi police. The officer and several othermen jumped into two Toyota Landcruisers. There were also two bulldozers.  With the bulldozers in the lead, the new nine-vehicle caravan drove west along a bumpy paved road that ran parallel to the Euphrates. In the fading light, the silhouettes of date palms fringed the road to the right. One of the prisoners in Ozer's bus was weak and faint, and a prisoner who spoke a little Arabic begged the new driver for water. This was not allowed, the driver answered. 'Let the man die,' he said. 'You are all men of Jalal Talabani.'  After half an hour, the convoy turned right on to a dirt road. Ahead the prisoners saw only desert and darkness. Some began to pray, muttering the Shehadeh--'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet...' Remembered images of his family flashed through Ibrahim's mind. By now all the men were weeping, asking what they had done to deserve such a fate, kissing each other's beards and exchanging words of forgiveness, as is the Muslim custom among those who know they are about to die.  * * *   It was almost dark, and the meaning of time had begun to dissolve. Ozer thought that the sealed buses traveled along this rutted desert track for about ten minutes; Omar estimated that the journey took from 15-30 minutes; Ibrahim said that it felt more like an hour. Suddenly, the bus lurched to a stop, bogged down in the deep sand. The vehicle behind, the last one in the convoy, swerved to the right to avoid it and got stuck as well. Through the wire-mesh screen in the sliding door, Ozer could see that the three remaining buses, as well as the two Landcruisers and one of the two bulldozers, had driven on ahead. In the half-light he could just make out the tops of the vehicles bobbing as they crested a rise and dipped into a shallow depression in the desert a quarter of a mile or so ahead. The driver turned off the engine.  Since the final turn on to the dirt road, there had no longer been any room for denial or wishful thinking. The men knew exactly what lay in store for them, and they began to plan feverishly, speaking in Kurdish in the knowledge that neither the guard nor the driver could understand them. When the guards arrived to kill them, they would put up a struggle. 'Even if only one of the thirty-five survived, it was worth the try,' said Ibrahim.  In the sudden quiet, the prisoners could hear the steady chatter of gunfire from automatic weapons, and the churning, whining sound of bulldozer engines. After perhaps twenty minutes, the guns fell silent. Out of the darkness, a bulldozer lumbered toward them and took up position behind the bus. Gears screaming, it tried several times to push the vehicle out of the sand, but the front wheels only dug in deeper. Next it tried to lift the bus out by its rear end, and Ozer thought the driver meant to tip them headlong into a trench, bus and all. At last, the bulldozer managed to drag the stalled vehicle out frontwards. The driver climbed down from his cab, exhausted by the effort, and took out his hip flask. The prisoners begged for water, banging on the windowless steel walls. The driver drank deeply and jeeringly held up his flask as the rest of the liquid trickled away into the sand.  It was now 7:30 p.m., and quite dark. The men were just able to tell the time by squinting at a watch that a prisoner from the village of Khidr Beg had somehow managed to hang on to at Topzawa. Twice more, there were volleys of gunfire and the sound of screams. After about half an hour, the two Landcruisers returned, with the officer who had joined the convoy at the bridge over the Euphrates. The driver of Ozer's bus climbed down from his seat, walked around to the back of the vehicle and turned off the overhead light in the rear compartment. Having done this, he went back to his cab and turned his headlights on full-beam. As Ozer and his companions whimpered in panic, the three dozen occupants of the second stalled bus were dragged into the pool of light, and a uniformed firing squad opened up on them with Kalashnikovs and pistols. When the firing stopped, the men were dragged into a freshly dug pit. Ozer noticed that some of the bodies were still moving. Only one busload of prisoners now remained.  The men's plan was this: When the first guard entered the bus to take the prisoners away, the strongest of them would overpower him, grab his weapon and try to wedge the door open. Most of the men were too weak to assist, but Ozer, Omar and a handful of others watched the sliding partition door. Ibrahim waited fearfully at the back, ready to bolt if he could. Through the grille, Ozer could see that two guards with pistols had taken up position on either side of the door; another, who carried a Kalashnikov stood by the driver's seat; while a fourth man, also armed with a Kalashnikov, guarded the outer door, with one foot planted on the step and the other on the ground.  After a few moments, one of the uniformed guards, a burly man with a thick neck, removed the padlock and slid back the connecting door to the driver's compartment. As soon as he did so, a prisoner named Salam lunged forward to strike him. But a second guard in the driver's cab opened fire with his pistol, killing Salam instantly, and slammed the door shut again. Ozer heard the first guard, apparently an officer, declare that he would execute the prisoners one by one.  Seizing command of the situation, Ozer issued his instructions. When the guards took the first prisoner out, Omar would throw his weight against the rail of the sliding door to prevent it from being closed. The other men would hurl themselves into the breach. And that is essentially what happened. The burly guard returned, pulled one prisoner into the open doorway and tied a white cloth around his eyes as a blindfold. As he turned to drag the man away, half a dozen prisoners rushed forward. Several of them laid hold of the shoulder strap of the guard's Kalashnikov, while he kept a firm grip of the stock and the barrel. Ozer yelled at another prisoner to punch the officer in the face. Although the man, like everyone, was weakened by several days without food, he succeeded in landing a blow on the officer's eye. Ozer wrenched the rifle free, but the officer managed to break loose, unclip the magazine and hurl it out of the bus behind him, rendering the weapon useless.  Pouring through the open door, the prisoners cut off the escape of the guard who had been standing by the driver's seat. Gunfire erupted, and two men fell dead on top of Ozer. Another prisoner tried to leap from the bus and was also cut down. As Ozer struggled to free himself, he saw the second of the four guards--the one who had killed Salam--stagger toward him, bleeding profusely from the shoulder. The man was screaming, 'Abu Saleh, come and help me!' It appeared that he had been shot by his own side. Ozer reached for the man's pistol but could not find it; instead, he wrestled him to the ground by his injured arm, and the guard lay still, apparently unconscious. Meanwhile the soldiers or police outside continued to rake the bus with gunfire, and the men in the passenger compartment cowered under the bus seats. Bodies piled up inside the bus, and Ibrahim took a painful flesh wound in the right buttock. He was also dimly aware that he could no longer see through his right eye. In the confusion, Omar managed to wriggle under the vehicle as bullets ricocheted from it on all sides. Ozer felt his leg grazed by a flying piece of shrapnel. As he lay there, he heard a strange sound between the bursts of firing. At first he could not place it; then herealized that it was the sound of blood dripping from the bus. Almost all of his fellow prisoners were dead.  * * *   Mustafa's Story   The remaining three vehicles that had accompanied the convoy from Kirkuk had come to a halt a few hundred yards ahead, in the shallow depression that Ozer had glimpsed through the driver's window. Here, the executions had proceeded in a more orderly and efficient fashion. It was maghreb--sunset--when guards flung open the rear door of the truck in which Mustafa, the 38-year old father of nine from the village of Top Khana, had travelled from Topzawa. The men were dragged out in pairs. In his fear, Mustafa left his shoes behind; he had taken them off in the bus because of the heat. He, too, was aware of the constant rat-a-tat of gunfire, which seemed not to come from a single site but from many directions at once. But he could see nothing, only darkness and desert.  The guards carried out a hasty body search, stripping Mustafa of his military ID papers but somehow failing to find the 200 dinars that he had managed to keep hidden in his clothing at Topzawa. He felt his hands being roughly bound behind him with his Kurdish cummerbund. His eyes were blindfolded with his headscarf, as were his companion's. The two men were ordered to walk. Mustafa, knowing that he was to die, began to recite under his breath the Ayat al-Kursi from the Koran. 'God: there is no god but He, the Living, the Everlasting...'5 He moved forward for about twenty yards, then felt himself stumbling down a slight incline. From a distance, the voice of a guard ordered the two men to liedown on their backs. As he obeyed the command, Mustafa felt himself sandwiched between his companion and another, inert body. His ears picked up the sound of a bulldozer's engine revving.  The next thing Mustafa heard was automatic weapons firing. To his side he felt a jolt and heard a groan. The clatter of gunfire ceased, and Mustafa heard the guards walk away. He realized that the bullets had missed him. Praying that he was unobserved, he tried to wriggle sideways, feeling more dead bodies as he moved, and struggling to loosen the cummerbund that bound his hands. Minutes later, he heard the guards return with another two prisoners, who lay down in the trench and were riddled with gunfire; then another pair, and another round of firing, this time a little further away. Mustafa was still unharmed. 'It was God's wish,' he thought.  This time, when the guards departed, Mustafa managed to work his blindfold loose. He saw that he was lying in a long, shallow trench, perhaps twenty feet wide and eighteen inches deep. The end of the trench, where the bulldozer had exited, was close by: this was the shallow incline into which he and his fellow prisoner had stumbled. In the other direction, the trench stretched away as far as Mustafa could see. It was filled with hundreds of corpses.  This macabre scene was illuminated by the headlights of the bulldozer, which now stood at the shallow entrance to the mass grave, its engine running. The driver appeared to be waiting for orders to cover the bodies with dirt when the trench was full, as it now almost was. Over the lip of the trench, Mustafa could still make out the dark shape of the vehicle that had brought him here. For fifteen minutes he lay where he was, listening to staccato gunfire and screams. After a while he realized that the sound was not in fact coming from all sides. The area behind him was silent, and Mustafa began cautiously to clamber over the bloody piles of dead bodies, away from the noise of the firing squads. Peering out, he saw that his was the last of many trenches. Behind him there was only desert. Mustafa ran.  He ran until morning, stopping only occasionally to catch his breath. Wild dogs chased him, smelling blood, and he kept them at bay by throwing stones at them. He saw lights in the darkness, but was afraid to go toward them. When the sun rose, he stumbled on to a dirt road. In the distance, he could see a city. But before he could reach it, he realized that the nearest building was a military base; two soldiers caught sight of him and waved him away on to another dirt road, but did notcome close enough to see the bloodstains on his clothes. The road that the soldiers had indicated brought Mustafa to a river. When he had washed the bloodstains from his clothes, he set off once more in the direction of the city. Before long, he ran into a shepherd, and asked the old man where he was. 'Ramadi,' the shepherd answered.  The old man explained that he was an Iranian Kurd who had been resettled in a nearby mujamma'a.6 He was curious about why Mustafa was barefoot. Thinking quickly, Mustafa replied that he was a government public works employee, and had been in a car crash. Since he had left all his papers in the wreck, he was anxious to avoid military checkpoints. The old man gave Mustafa an address in the complex and told him how he could sneak in without being observed by the guards.  Reaching the house, Mustafa smelled the aroma of fresh bread. He found a woman baking. What was this place, he asked. She told him it was a complex that had been built for Iranian Kurds, although she herself was an Iraqi Kurd from Khanaqin.7 Her husband was at market, she explained, but would return before long. When the man arrived, Mustafa repeated his car-crash story and asked for advice on how he could get back to Baghdad. A bus would soon be leaving the complex for Ramadi, the man said. He gave Mustafa instructions on how to evade the checkpoints, and pressed on him some food and a pair of slippers. When Mustafa got to the entrance to the complex, the bus was just pulling away, but he flagged it down and the driver stopped. As Mustafa boarded the bus, he recognized one of the other passengers. It was someone he knew from the Jafan area. It was Ozer.  * * *   After the massacre in the bus, Ozer had managed to slip away into the darkness. He ran for a while, confused and angry, before tripping headlong into a trench. He fell on top of a body. It was bleeding from the nose, but the man was still breathing. This trench was very different from the one in which Mustafa had been laid for execution. It was ten or twelve feet deep, Ozer remembered, and only about six feet wide. He estimated that it contained 400 bodies. Scrambling out again, he fled into the desert. Fearful of being recognized as a Kurd, he stripped off his clothes and rolled them into a bundle, which he carried on his shoulder. Like Mustafa, he had left his shoes behind.  He walked or ran for hours. 'I passed only trenches filled with bodies; I could tell what they were by the smell,' he recalled. 'I also saw many mounds made by bulldozers. The whole area was full of trenches with corpses.'  At one point he crossed a paved road and came to water, perhaps a lake. On the other side he could see the tall shapes of date palms. He knelt down to drink, but stopped short when he saw the headlights of a vehicle approaching. Afraid that it was one of the Landcruisers from the execution squad, he plunged into the water and started to wade toward the far shore. But when he was waist-deep, he noticed with relief that the car had turned in another direction. Now, Ozer also saw the lights of distant buildings, and he headed toward them. It was perhaps 4:00 a.m.  It turned out to be the same complex that Mustafa had reached. Ozer later learned that it housed thousands of people from the Qaser Shirin border area, who had been kept here as virtual hostages since the early days of the Iran-Iraq War. The complex was encircled with barbed wire, and its residents were barred from leaving, other than on eight-hour passes that allowed them to shop at the market in Ramadi.  Ozer peered through the doorway at the first building he passed. He saw two people asleep in an inner courtyard, and knocked. A man's voice called out in Kurdish, 'Who's there?'  'A poor man in need of bread and water,' Ozer answered.  Neighbors, aroused by the noise, came out from the building next door to see what was happening. But when they saw Ozer, they promptly slammed their door shut again. In answer to his repeated knocking, it was opened once more, and Ozer saw an old man and his two sons brandishing sticks at him. When he blurted out his story to the men, they agreed to give him some food--bean soup and bread. But they were too afraid to shelter a ragged Kurdish fugitive in their home. In the earlydawn, Ozer went begging from door to door, until a man named Ahmad agreed to take him to the terminal where he could catch a minibus to Ramadi. On the bus, he met Mustafa. The two men traveled together as far as the Baghdad bus terminal, where Mustafa thought he recognized an Istikhbarat officer he had seen in Topzawa, and fled on his own into the crowds. Ozer eventually reached the Kurdish quarter of Kirkuk. That night, watching television, Ozer saw himself in a news flash that showed the Iraqi Army watching over captured 'Iranian agents'--the film shot at the Qader Karam police station on April 10.8  * * *   Taymour's Story   Through a series of chance occurrences in the desert, five men--Muhammad, Ozer, Mustafa, Omar and Ibrahim--survived the culmination of the Iraqi regime's Anfal campaign. From the testimony of these five survivors, it is apparent that one of the principal purposes of Anfal was to exterminate all adult males of military service age captured in rural Iraqi Kurdistan. Firing squads murdered these Kurds by the tens ofthousands with no semblance of due process, by virtue of nothing more than their age, their ethnicity and their presence in 'prohibited areas' supposedly influenced by the parties of the Kurdish peshmerga. As Ali Hassan al-Majid had insisted on many occasions, paragraph five of Northern Bureau Command directive SF/4008 was being carried out to the letter.9  The bodies of many of the victims of Anfal lie in mass graves outside the Iraqi town of Ramadi, ploughed under by bulldozers in a desert area that, for the moment, remains inaccessible to outside observers. But it is apparent that this was not the only mass execution site used during Anfal. On this score the testimonies of Ozer, Mustafa, Omar and Ibrahim leave a number of enigmas still unanswered. Their accounts indicate that thousands lie buried outside Ramadi; yet they also say that only five buses from an original convoy of more than thirty took the road to Ramadi that night. The remainder broke off outside Falluja and drove off in another direction, and the inference must be that these prisoners were taken to be executed elsewhere.  Middle East Watch has received detailed reports, based on hearsay, of at least three other mass execution sites that were used during the Anfal campaign. One of these was in the vicinity of the archeological site of Al-Hadhar (Hatra), some sixty miles south of the city of Mosul. (There is ample material here for the connoisseur of historical irony, since Saddam Hussein had spent lavish resources on excavating Al-Hadhar as part of his search for the ancient origins of the Iraqi Arab nation--only to dig it up again as a burial place for his non-Arab enemies.)10  Another reported execution site was near Hamrin Mountain, to the south of Tuz Khurmatu. One account, citing an eyewitness, speaks of forty busloads of Kurds, in the custody of Republican Guards, being machinegunned by a dirt road leading to the Otheim river. A third report speaks of mass executions at another part of Hamrin Mountain, between Tikrit and Kirkuk--this one involving an estimated 2,000 women and children.  The lists of those who disappeared during Anfal, which are routinely pressed on all visitors to Iraqi Kurdistan, are by no means restricted to the names of young and middle-aged men. Indeed, from the fragmentary lists given to Middle East Watch, it is apparent that more than half of those who disappeared from southern Germian and the Lesser Zab Valley were women and children. Some of those who disappeared were no doubt infant refugees who perished on the freezing roads to Iran or Turkey. Many other small children were allowed to die of starvation and disease in the prison at Dibs. Hundreds of children (whose fates are known, and thus do not figure in these lists of the disappeared) were among the victims of the chemical gas attacks on Halabja, Goktapa and other sites. But many children also went before the firing squads.  One of these children of Anfal was Taymour Abdullah Ahmad, the 12-year old from Kulajo in the nahya of Tilako in southern Germian, just six or seven miles from Muhammad's home village of Aliyani Taza. Taymour was the first--and until recent Middle East Watch interviews the only--known survivor of a mass execution during Anfal. He remains the only eyewitness to the mass killing of women and children. His story has been well documented elsewhere, but it bears repeating here in its proper context.11  Taymour had lived in Kulajo from the age of three. His father, Abdullah, was a wheat farmer, and the family--Taymour, his parents, and his three younger sisters--lived in a humble four-room mud house. Thesiblings were closely bunched in age. In 1988, Taymour was twelve. His eldest sister, Jelas, was a year younger; Laulau was ten, and Sunur nine. Kulajo was swept up in the massive three-day army sweep through southern Germian in the second week of April, and fleeing before the advancing troops, Taymour and his family were funneled through the first collection-point at Melistura. They hoped to make their way to the complex of Sumoud, where some relatives had been relocated in 1986 and 1987, but this was impossible. From Melistura they were taken by tractor-hauled cart to the fort at Qoratu, and thence, after ten days, to the Popular Army camp at Topzawa.  By now Taymour knew that this campaign was different from any of the past, and even in Qoratu he began to fear that he and his family were to be executed. At Topzawa, his father was taken away, and Taymour never saw him again. Through the window of his hall, he watched as male prisoners were handcuffed together, stripped to their undershorts and hustled away. The rest of Taymour's family remained at Topzawa for a month, and were fed on bread and water and a little cheese. During this time Taymour saw several younger children weaken and die.  One day in late May, at about six in the morning, the guards led Taymour, his mother and sisters out into the courtyard and checked their names off on a list. A convoy of vehicles awaited, apparently the same kind in which Mustafa had been driven to Ramadi about a month earlier. They were painted green or white, and Taymour thought that the absence of windows made them look like oversized ambulances. He counted fifty or sixty women and children, seated along the four benches that stretched the length of each bus. To enter the passenger section, the prisoners had to pass through two small guards' compartments, connected by an interior door. Other guards rode in front with the driver. The only ventilation came from a small wire-mesh opening at the rear. Taymour could not see outside.  They drove until sunset along a paved highway, halting only once. Taymour craned to look out through the wire-mesh screen, but all he saw of their stopping place was a large water tank painted in camouflage colors. The heat was oppressive, the doors remained locked, and there was nothing to drink. As the bus drove on, three children collapsed and died, all of them younger than Taymour. But still they did not stop. No one spoke: 'They were too afraid,' Taymour remembered, 'too exhausted, too hungry and thirsty, too desperate.'  It was nightfall when the caravan stopped and the guards took the prisoners outside. In the darkness, Taymour could see nothing but endless desert. But he could see now that there were about thirty vehicles in the convoy. Dozens of soldiers milled around; they appeared to have been accompanying the buses in Toyota Landcruisers.12 They gave the prisoners a little water to drink from their canteens and then blindfolded each one with a strip of white cloth. Since there were hundreds of people, the process took a long time--about an hour, Taymour thought. When it was over, the prisoners reboarded the buses, and Taymour promptly removed his blindfold. The jolting of the bus told him that they had left the highway and were driving along a dirt road into the desert.  After half an hour the bus stopped again and the guards threw open the rear doors. Taymour saw that each vehicle was neatly positioned next to its own burial pit, some fifteen feet square and less than a yard deep. A fresh mound of dirt rose up behind each pit. The guards shoved the prisoners roughly over the edge, and in the panic and confusion Taymour was separated from his mother and sisters. Almost at once an officer and a soldier opened fire with their Kalashnikovs. Taymour was hit in the left shoulder. Despite the pain, he began to stagger toward the soldier who had shot him. He remembered noticing that the man had tears in his eyes. But as Taymour tried to grab hold of him and climb out of the pit, the officer barked out an order in Arabic, and the soldier fired again. This second bullet caught Taymour on the right side of his back, just above the waist. This time he lay still.  Apparently satisfied, the soldiers walked away. Taymour could no longer see the men, but he could hear their voices in the darkness some distance away. He also became aware of a movement next to him. He could see that it was a young girl, and she appeared to be unhurt. 'Let's run,' Taymour whispered to her.  'I can't,' the girl answered. 'I'm too afraid of the soldiers.'  Without stopping to argue, Taymour clambered on to the hard-packed mound of dirt behind the grave. He later heard a rumor that a young Kurdish girl had been found alive in the desert at this time, and surmised that it was the companion he had left behind. As for his motherand three daughters, they did not survive the execution squads that night.13  Like the girl, Taymour was at first too scared to run, since the Landcruisers were still driving around the execution site, their headlights sweeping in circles through the darkness. Taymour scooped out a shallow hole in the top of the mound and lay down flat. Each time the headlights moved away, Taymour dragged himself to the next trench. His had been the last one filled with bodies; in the direction he was now heading, the pits were still empty. As he reached each one, he stopped and flattened himself against the earth mound, hoping that he was invisible from below.  The next thing he knew, it was much later. He had passed out on top of the fifth or sixth mound. The blood was still flowing freely from his wounds. But the whole area was quiet now. The sealed buses and landcruisers had gone, and although Taymour never saw or heard any bulldozers, the pits that contained the bodies of that night's execution victims had been filled with dirt and smoothed flat. No fresh bodies were visible, and Taymour passed another twenty empty trenches as he fled into the darkness. He remembered thinking just one thing as he dragged his injured body away from the killing grounds: 'If I get out of this alive, I will give five dinars to the poor.'  There was no moon. Once he saw car headlights in the distance behind him. He came to the intersection of two dirt roads and struck out blindly along one of them. After a couple of hours, he discerned the shadowy outline of a Bedouin encampment. Dogs barked, and the noise woke the owner of the nearest tent, who emerged with a flashlight. Seeing a boy in Kurdish dress, covered in blood, he yanked Taymour inside. They could not communicate--the Bedouin spoke no Kurdish, and Taymour knew not a word of Arabic. And the man could do nothing to treat Taymour's wounds--although these proved not to be life-threatening. But he kept him safe in the tent for three days and then drove him in his truck to the nearest town. This was Samawa, the city south of Baghdad that had been the final stop for the convoys of sick and elderly people who were taken to Nugra Salman. Taymour stayed there, sheltered by a friendly Arab family, for more than two years. Eventually the family managed to smuggle a message through intermediaries to a surviving uncle of Taymour's in Kalar, letting him know that the boy was alive and well. In October 1990, Taymour and his uncle were reunited. The following year, after the failed Kurdish uprising, Taymour's story began to filter out, giving the outside world its first real glimpse of the horror that was Anfal.  ______   1 Muhammad's story is based on a Middle East Watch interview with him on the site of Aliyani Taza village, March 30, 1993.  2 Ar'ar, an Iraqi-Saudi border post and a way-station for pilgrims traveling to Mecca, was mentioned in several interviews as a site for internments and mass executions during Anfal. A guard at Nugra Salman, for instance, told one elderly detainee that Kurdish prisoners from Anfal were being held there.  3 Again there are some minor discrepancies in the witnesses' estimates of the size of the convoy. But the various figures given to Middle East Watch would suggest that it contained between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners.  4 The reference is apparently to the high proportion of Republican Guards from Mosul.  5 The Ayat al-Kursi, 'the Throne,' is verse 255 of the second Sura of the Koran. It reads in full, 'God: there is no god but He, the Living, the Everlasting. Slumber seizes him not, neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Who is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave? He knows what lies before them and what is after them, and they comprehend not anything of His knowledge save such as He will. His Throne comprises the heavens and the earth; the preserving of them oppresses Him not. He is the All-high, the All-glorious.' Arberry (trans.), The Koran Interpreted, p.65.  6 The old shepherd was presumably one of the thousands of Iranian Kurds relocated from their border villages after the Iraqi Army's occupation of portions of Iran's Kermanshah province in 1980. The location described by Mustafa is strongly suggestive of a camp called Al-Tash, outside Ramadi, which once held as many as 30,000 people. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which had access to this camp, some 12-15,000 prisoners remained there in mid-1992. Middle East Watch interview, Geneva, July 14, 1992.  7 And therefore probably a victim of the Arabization campaign of the mid-1970s. Khanaqin lies in the extreme southeastern part of Iraqi Kurdistan, in the Arabized section of Diyala governorate.  8 Ibrahim and Omar, the remaining two survivors of the massacre in the bus, also made it back to Kurdistan. But for both men the ordeal was not yet over. Ibrahim, who like Ozer and Mustafa passed through the complex of Iranian Kurds on his way to Ramadi, was recaptured as a deserter in Baghdad, and passed through a series of military jails before taking refuge with a contingent of jahsh in Suleimaniyeh. Omar spent a further period in hiding in Kurdistan before eventually surrendering to the army in September, after the general amnesty. He was forced into another period in the military and sent to serve in Kuwait (as was Ozer) after the August 1990 Iraqi invasion. He deserted for the last time three days before the beginning of the air war in January 1991.  Anwar Tayyar, who had been on the same bus as Ozer, Ibrahim and Omar, also escaped from the execution site and was seen in late May or early June by peshmerga hiding out in the Qader Karam area. He had sustained four flesh wounds during the shooting in the bus, and had been left for dead. After the encounter near Qader Karam, Anwar Tayyar disappeared for good. The last peshmerga to see him alive speculate that he either starved to death or was captured by the army and killed. Middle East Watch interview with former PUK commander, Kalar, March 30, 1993.  9 This, it should be recalled, stated that, 'All persons captured in those [prohibited] villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them.' See above p.64.  10 Saddam Hussein's fascination with Al-Hadhar is detailed in Baram's Culture, History and Ideology, pp.53-54. Al-Hadhar may also be the site referred to by a former Zakho mustashar interviewed by Neil Conan of National Public Radio in the U.S.; this man spoke of 12,000 Kurdish men being executed at an unknown site in August 1988 after being imprisoned in Mosul. Conan's interview is cited in Makiya, Cruelty and Silence, p.144. There are also persistent but unconfirmed reports of mass Anfal graves near Ar'ar on the Iraqi-Saudiborder, and in Diwaniyah and Naseriyah governorates in southern Iraq.  11 See for example, Middle East Watch/Physicians for Human Rights, Unquiet Graves: The Search for the Disappeared in Iraqi Kurdistan, February 1992, pp. 23-25; and Makiya, Cruelty and Silence, chapter 5. Taymur has also been featured extensively in television reports, including 'Saddam's Killing Fields,' CBS '60 Minutes,' February 23, 1992.  12 Although Taymour referred to the executioners as 'soldiers,' he had no specific recollection of their uniforms, and it is much more likely that the men belonged to another agency, such as the Ba'ath Party or Amn.  13 Taymour, in fact, lost a total of twenty-eight relatives in Anfal. In addition to his father, mother and three sisters, they included his uncle, Omar Ahmad Qader; his aunt, Ayna Ahmad Qader, her husband, Hama Sa'id Mohi-al-Din Abd-al-Karim and their three young children; his aunt, Mahsa Muhammad Mahmoud and her nine children; an unmarried aunt, Hamdia Muhammad Mahmoud; his uncle, Osman Muhammad Mahmoud, his wife, Amina Ali Aziz, and four of their fourteen children. Middle East Watch interview with Taymour Abdullah Ahmad, Sumoud Complex, July 29, 1992.  10   Final Anfal: Badinan, August 25-September 6, 1988   'There was medicine from the airplane.'   -- victim of the August 25 chemical attack on the village of Gizeh, Amadiya.   With only the last remnants of the PUK continuing to resist, Baghdad's plans for wiping out Mas'oud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) now began to advance rapidly. On August 7, 1988, as we have seen, Ali Hassan al-Majid personally stepped in to urge the Iraqi Army to hasten the completion of the Anfal operation. The following day, the Army High Command issued its 'communique of communiques,' to announce that a ceasefire had come into effect on Iraq's terms, putting an end to the eight-year Iran-Iraq War that had cost as many as a million lives.1   The ceasefire gave the Iraqi Army the critical boost it required to bring Anfal to a close. The First Corps, which had handled the earlier phases of Anfal from its base in Kirkuk, would now mop up the lingering resistance in the Shaqlawa-Rawanduz valleys. The Fifth Army Corps, based in Erbil, would take charge of operations in Dohuk governorate, along the Iraqi-Turkish border. Other divisions, reportedly including elements of the Third, Sixth and Seventh Armies, were now redeployed to Iraqi Kurdistan from the southern war front around Fao and Basra.   In his review of the Final Anfal campaign, Fifth Corps commander Brig. Gen. Yunis Zareb wrote, 'The morale was so high and was clear on the faces of the fighters from the beginning, and especially after the collapse of the Iranian enemy in the victorious campaigns starting from the eternal battle of Fao through the battle of Muhammadthe Prophet of God.2 The formations which took part in [Anfal] had also taken part in those battles.'3   This massive concentration of firepower was necessary, the general felt, because of the difficult logistical problems that his troops had to face in classic guerrilla warfare country:   The land is generally hilly with a hard terrain in its northern and eastern parts which lie parallel to the border line of Iraq and Turkey. There are many gardens, forests and natural trees. The surface of the earth consists of rocky lands and a sedimentary surface in the highlands. And the lowlands are a combination of hard land with a mixed soil of sand and mud which gradually descends westward and southward in the direction of the Sleivani and Aqra plains. This area has many rivers and valleys which run from the north and east toward the south and west, forming streams. The movement of the forces and machinery is greatly hindered by the series of mountains, high knolls, valleys and other obstacles.4   It was a military planner's inelegant description of Badinan, the traditional mountainous heartland of Mullah Mustafa Barzani and his sons, the 'offspring of treason.'   Although the terrain complicated the logistical needs of a regular army, the campaign against the KDP was in other respects more straightforward than the drive to destroy the PUK. The KDP peshmerga were largely concentrated in a single geographical area, Badinan, whereits operations were run from a headquarters at Zewa Shkan, an abandoned village hard up against the Turkish border.5   * * *     Although the Ba'ath Party had devoted five months to 'purifying' the areas that were under the control of the PUK, it had never abandoned its particular hatred for the KDP. Once allied with the Shah, the KDP had rekindled a close relationship with the clerical regime in Teheran, and on several occasions acted as scouts for the Iranian army on the northern front. The strength of this alliance was curious in a sense, for religious fervor had never been a part of the KDP's identity. Instead, the party was deeply imbued with the traditional values of the steep, narrow valleys of Badinan, a 4,000 square-mile chunk of the Zagros Mountains bounded to the east by the Greater Zab river and to the north by Turkey. There are no major cities in this inhospitable terrain. Badinan has none of the cosmopolitan sophistication of a Suleimaniyeh, none of the thriving industry of an Erbil or a Kirkuk. Tribal structures and loyalties remained powerful, and the KDP had long made common cause with conservative local aghas and sheikhs who were still touched by a certain nostalgia for the days of the Ottoman Empire, when tribal fiefdoms in Kurdistan were granted a large measure of autonomy.6   While the KDP inspired a devoted partisan following, historically centered on the Barzan Valley, it had also made powerful enemies among other tribal leaders. These schisms in turn meant that the final stage ofAnfal had some characteristics that set it apart from the rest of the operation. Some of the tribal groups who had made a separate peace with Baghdad managed to avoid the worst of Anfal. A considerable number of villages survived in Badinan and on its fringes, at least for a time--especially those of the Surchi, the Zebari, the Bradost and the Dolamari. And Kurdish villagers who might otherwise have died were spared if the local mustashar could convince Baghdad that they were not contaminated by peshmerga sympathies.   It was never easy for outsiders to guess the numbers of active peshmerga in the KDP. According to one 1985 estimate, the party had some 6,000 fighters, compared to 5,000 for the PUK.7 A later estimate put the strength of each group at 10,000 in 1988.8 In fact these figures, cited by sympathetic writers, may have been inflated. Military and civilian intelligence reports told the Fifth Corps Commander, Brig. Gen. Zareb, that the total strength of the 'saboteurs' in Badinan was no more than 2,600.9   Against this puny force, and against the civilian population of Badinan, Ali Hassan al-Majid's Northern Bureau sent as many as 200,000 troops. According to several former Iraqi military sources interviewed by Middle East Watch, between fourteen and sixteen regular army divisions of 12,000 men each took part in the Final Anfal campaign, in addition to a Chemical Weapons Battalion, units of the Iraqi Air Force and the National Defense Battalions, or jahsh. The regime's strategy, wrote Gen.Zareb, was 'based on the guidelines issued by the Northern Bureau and those of the Chief of Staff in the August 7 Kirkuk conference.' The underlying doctrine was the simple one that worked so well in the earlier phases of Anfal--the application of overwhelming force, 'to operate by moving from the outside toward the inside in order to encircle the saboteurs, with 'different forces act[ing] simultaneously to guarantee the encirclement.'10   Larger geopolitical considerations also seem to have played a part in this thinking. 'The area of operations was adjacent to the international Iraqi-Turkish border,' Gen. Zareb observed, 'and this caused some perplexity....Accordingly, all forces were ordered to tackle the matter in the best possible way and ensure the secrecy of the operation by not transgressing the frontier.'11   The general's final headache was a logistical one. 'The magnitude of the engineering work needed for the destruction and removal of the remnants of the saboteurs and their premises in the areas covered by the operation...was so great that it put an extra burden on the shoulders of the command of the unit.'12 The removal of the remnants of the 'saboteurs' and their premises: in other words, the destruction of some 300-400 Kurdish villages of Badinan.   * * *     Badinan on the Eve of the Final Anfal     In the days that preceded the Final Anfal, there were ample signs of what was to come. The massive buildup of ground troops was visible along the main highways of Dohuk governorate, and the area was softened up by intense shelling and aerial bombing, sometimes with cluster bombs. In the village of Spindar, for example, on the southern slopes of Gara Mountain, aircraft dropped cluster bombs on August 24,killing two small boys, cousins aged four and five, as they tended their family's goats in the fields.13   Even as these preliminary attacks began, some families began to flee, especially if their villages lay within walking distance of the Turkish border. But others stayed where they were, waiting for the violence to pass. After all, they reasoned, villages like Spindar had been attacked many times since the mid-1960s. Although Spindar itself had been burned down more than once, the government had never prevented the inhabitants from returning to rebuild.   The regime's control of Dohuk governorate had dwindled to a handful of towns and complexes along the main roads. From these strongholds, army troops had maintained brutally thorough checkpoints since the mid-1980s. 'No food was allowed through,' one villager recalled, 'not even small cans of infant formula, and produce was not permitted to be taken to market.'14 Another villager added, 'For three or four years before Anfal only women were able to pass through the checkpoints. People resorted to smuggling--flour, rice, salt, oil, kerosene, soap, detergent and sesame paste--but everything cost much more this way. At the checkpoint [in the town of Sarseng] the soldiers confiscated anything they found and set fire to it. Sometimes women were able to hide things underneath their dresses.'15 But several witnesses told stories of boys and men being arrested, and disappearing, if they were found concealing food, which was presumed to be destined for the peshmerga.   In Badinan, as in the Sorani-speaking areas to the south, the Kurds had long grown accustomed to the harsh routines of wartime. Aircraft bombed, strafed and rocketed them whenever the armed forces received intelligence reports of peshmerga movements. When the planes approached, villagers fled to caves, makeshift shelters or 'shades.' Occasionally, helicopters would drop infantry troops into a village for house-to-house searches for draft-dodgers and deserters. Artilleryemplacements in the nearest large town or military base rained down poorly directed shellfire, which would sometimes kill some luckless farmer working his fields. As if these Iraqi attacks were not enough, the inhabitants of some border areas also had to contend with raids from Turkish aircraft on search-and-destroy missions against contingents of guerrillas from Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which maintained bases inside northern Iraq.16   In the spring of 1987, in accordance with the first decrees issued by the newly appointed Ali Hassan al-Majid, virtually the whole of Dohuk governorate--an area a little smaller than the state of Connecticut--was 'redlined.' As in the Sorani-speaking areas, there was a fresh flurry of village-burning that April and May, with some forty-nine villages being destroyed in various parts of Badinan.17 The 'redlining' was announced over the official radio, said a man from a village near the town of Mangesh. Those who came over to the government side would be considered 'our people,' the broadcast declared. Those who did not would be regarded as Iranians. To drive home this message, the government blocked off the dirt roads leading to prohibited villages with mounds of earth.18 When the October census came, it had only a very limited effect in rural Badinan; many villages, Middle East Watch was told, did not even know of its existence.   Despite the grim news about Anfal that had filtered through to Badinan via KDP radio broadcasts from Iran, villagers do not appear to have believed that the government campaign of 1988 would be any different from its predecessors. Inexplicably, this absence of any unusual alarm afflicted not merely the civilian population but the KDP itself, whose central committee was meeting inside Iran as the Final Anfal approached, and seemed not to be anticipating anything out of theordinary. Although local peshmerga alerted villagers to the possibility that chemical weapons might be used, the KDP leadership does not appear to have broadcast any emergency alert. 'After Halabja, we thought the international community would stop Saddam Hussein,' one regional commander said--an astonishingly sanguine attitude, in view of the dozens of chemical attacks that had followed that spring and summer.19   Even in its own highly classified internal documents, the Iraqi military was evasive--almost to the point of silence--on the matter of chemical weapons during the Final Anfal.20 Gen. Zareb's report noted only that a battalion specialized in their use had played 'a unique role' in the campaign, 'just like all the other groups.' The unit was kept in a state of readiness and supervised the use of flamethrowers by infantry troops. Otherwise, Zareb wrote, 'It did not have another role during the battle because the battle was within the national geographical boundaries'--a curious scruple on the general's part, given how widely chemical artillery had been used on Iraqi soil in the earlier stages of the Anfal campaign.   Gen. Zareb's assertion may appear contradictory, given that the use of chemical weapons in the Badinan campaign was given wide publicity by the international press. But the explanation is quite simple: chemical bombing operations during the Final Anfal were the exclusive responsibility of the Iraqi Air Force, and the army's chemical artillerypieces that reportedly were deployed in a half dozen locations remained silent.21   Through the testimonies of traumatized Kurdish refugees in Turkey, the world learned quickly of the use of mustard gas and nerve agents in Badinan.22 Listing forty-nine villages that had been 'exposed' to gas, Galbraith and Van Hollen concluded that Iraq had 'used chemical weapons on a broad scale against its Kurdish population beginning August 25, 1988,' and that the attacks had 'been accompanied by large loss of civilian life.'23   * * *     'Apples and Something Sweet':     The Chemical Attacks of August 25     The first gas fell on the KDP headquarters at Zewa Shkan, close to the Turkish border, late in the evening of August 24. Ten peshmerga reportedly died. The next morning, August 25, between about 6:30 and8:30 a.m., Iraqi warplanes launched a number of separate and almost simultaneous attacks, perhaps a dozen in all. Many of them were probably carried out by the same flight of aircraft, since they were concentrated within a strip measuring approximately sixty miles wide and twenty deep. Some of the aircraft targeted a single village or peshmerga base, but in at least two cases the planes hit a whole string of villages in rapid succession. (see map) The intent seems to have been less to kill than to spread mass terror. Perhaps twenty civilians died on the spot, and about the same number of peshmerga. But hundreds more, especially children, succumbed in the weeks that followed.   The precise cause of their deaths remains unknowable; it may have been the lethal after-effects of a combination of mustard gas and Sarin nerve gas; or the consequences of exposure, cold and hunger in the mountains where they fled; or the malnutrition and disease they endured in the camps after they were captured; or a combination of all three. In a sense, the question is academic; whatever the precise cause may have been, it was the Iraqi government that was responsible for their deaths.   In one interview after another, those who lived through the chemical attacks of the Final Anfal told very similar stories.   · The village of Birjinni, in the nahya of Zawita, had the misfortune to lie almost midway between two of the KDP's most important bases--one, the party's regional headquarters, located due north in the village of Tuka, just across the Khabour river, and the other a little way to the east, in the village of Gelnaskeh. All three places were hit by chemical weapons at breakfast time on August 25. The people of Birjinni had been watching the sky since dawn. For several days they had been aware of unusual numbers of aircraft overhead, and they were fearful of a conventional bombing attack. As eight airplanes came into view, many of the villagers fled in fear to the shelters they had built nearby. Three of the planes made a low pass over the village, from east to west, and dropped four bombs each. Surviving villagers told of clouds of smoke billowing upward, 'white, black and then yellow, rising about fifty or sixty yards into the air in a column. Then the column began to break up and drift. It drifted down into the valley and then passed through the village. Then we smelled the gas.'   It was a pleasant smell at first; 'it smelled of apples and something sweet.' Others said it reminded them of 'pesticides in our fields.' Soon, however, 'it became bitter. It affected our eyes and ourmouths and our skin. All of a sudden it was hard to breathe.'24 The villagers later found that four people from a single Birjinni family had died, including a 58-year old man and his five-year old grandson. The aircraft continued to circle overhead for perhaps a half hour, apparently observing the results of the raid. Others came later that day, dropping conventional weapons that set the tinder-dry late summer fields ablaze. From the mountain saddle on which Birjinni was built, the villagers could see that the surrounding area was filled with refugees, all fleeing northward in the direction of the Turkish border.25   · A few miles to the north of Birjinni, close to the Khabour river, the planes hit Tilakru, a large village that was home to many army deserters. A woman named Halima was preparing breakfast for her children when the bombs fell. She heard muffled explosions and looked out to see clouds of white smoke turning yellow. Her husband, a peshmerga on active duty, had told her how to recognize the signs. Having served in the Iran-Iraq War, he knew very well what a chemical attack looked like.   Halima's children had been asleep on the roof, so she pulled them down as quickly as she could, one by one, and bundled them into the family's air-raid shelter, a hole in the ground covered with wood, leaves and dirt. Looking round in horror, she realized that her one-year old baby, Zozan, was missing. Halima found her crawling around in the courtyard. But by the time she reached her, the child's face had turned yellow and she was gasping for breath and trying to vomit. Halima rushed her into the shelter and flung wet blankets over the walls. Buther infant daughter could not be saved, and she died several days later in a prison camp, as did several other children from Tilakru.26   · From a vantage point in the village of Spindarok, on the far bank of the Khabour, a farmer named Suleiman watched through binoculars as two aircraft attacked the KDP base at Tuka and the hamlet of Barkavreh, a few hundred yards away. With his radio tuned to an air force frequency, Suleiman even overheard snatches of the two pilots' cockpit conversation:   'They are firing at us.'   'Drop the bombs on the high places.'   'Don't fire while you are behind me. Hold your fire until you are next to me.'   Suleiman concluded that the pilots were responding to ground fire. A friend, Obeid, said that in this area at least, there had been specific warnings of reprisals: 'The government had told people that if a single bullet were to be fired from a village, a chemical bomb would be dropped. People came from government-controlled areas bringing this information.' In the course of some 350 Middle East Watch field interviews, this was virtually the only example cited of the government issuing any prior warning of its intentions.   Suleiman counted thirteen bombs in all. Although most of them fell outside the village, he learned later that two bombs had landed close to the peshmerga headquarters, on the western outskirts of Tuka. According to three separate accounts, fourteen peshmerga died there, and one civilian. Since the wind was blowing from the east, all the farm animals on the western side of the village died, although no one inside the perimeter of the village was harmed.27   · The village of Warmilleh lay a little nearer to Turkey, between the Khabour and the western edge of Mattin Mountain, a peshmerga stronghold. The nearest guerrilla camp was in Bazeh, a three and a half hour walk across the mountains to the east. The people of Warmilleh, like those of Birjinni, had been expecting an attack on the morning ofAugust 25. Again, it came at about 8:00 a.m. This time, they counted six aircraft, but only two of them took part in the attack, dropping six bombs each. 'We were lucky,' a villager remembered, 'for the wind was in the opposite direction to where the people were sheltering under the trees, half a kilometer away.'28 Five people were affected by the drifting gas. They vomited; their skin turned black and peeled off. But a peshmerga doctor arrived later that afternoon, administered injections, and the five injured villagers joined their families' northward flight to the Turkish border.   Directly across the river, the planes also hit the village of Bilejaneh. The chemicals drifted on the wind to a hamlet called Bani. 'I got sick and had to vomit,' said a man who lived there. 'We left Bani that afternoon and went to Bilejaneh and Girka. After that we had to cross the main road [from Begova to Kani Masi]. The army was not there yet. The first troops arrived at 2:00 a.m. on August 26 and cut off the escape route to Turkey. Those who crossed the main road before this were lucky. We got there at about 1:00 a.m., just before the soldiers.'29   · North of the main road, one direct route to Turkey led through the villages of Ruseh and Nazdureh. 'When the military came and began camping out on the road to Nazdureh, people expected an attack and fled,' according to a KDP peshmerga from Ruseh, who had sent his family on ahead to Turkey.   The army attacked the next morning. The Iraqis were trying to seal the border area. People who were close to the border managed to cross, but those who failed were arrested and disappeared. I was near the border when the chemical attack happened. I saw yellow smoke. I was on top of the mountain, but people in the valley below were affected. My brother, who was two or three hundred meters away from me on the mountain side, was also affected by the chemicals. He began frothing at the mouth and choking and his skin became dark. Thenhe died. His name was Salim, and he was 45-years old. We buried him there on the spot.30   · The most concentrated attacks, however, came along Gara Mountain, the great ridge that begins near the town of Sarseng and stretches east for twenty miles or more. Here, the air force targeted at least fifteen and perhaps as many as thirty separate villages.31 On the southern slopes, the neighboring villages of Avok, Swareh, Sidara and Spindar (nahya of Sarseng) were all hit at about 8:00 a.m. on the same morning, August 25. There was a peshmerga base in the mountains nearby, and the people of Swareh had moved to the ravines and caves of Avok a year or so earlier in response to the government's continuous bombing and shelling.   A young women named Khadija was in one of these caves with her nine children when the bombs fell. Her elder sister, Aisha, had just gone outside to wash the dirty plates from breakfast. Khadija heard a series of powerful explosions, as if the bombs had fallen right overhead, and the mouth of the cave was quickly obscured by white smoke. The smoke smelled like 'the same medicine that is sprayed on apples,' and everyone inside the cave grew dizzy and found it hard to breathe. Their eyes burned and teared. Two teenage boys who had been hiding among the bushes outside tried to sprint to safety. But the planes cut them down with machinegun fire, and both youngsters died.   After about an hour, when the smoke had cleared, the family ventured out fearfully to look for Aisha. They found her lying on the ground outside the cave. She was sighing and moving her lips as if she wanted to speak, but no words came. She had vomited, and her skin was black. A few yards away the grass was blackened and burned, and dead farm animals lay all around. Aisha lived only another two or three hours. When the family washed her body that night for burial in the villagecemetery, her dry and blackened skin came off in their hands.32 Another young woman, Amina, also died in the attack. Others died later as they tried to hide out in the mountains, but many families managed to escape by walking through the narrow Ashawa Valley, close to the extravagant mountaintop palace which President Saddam Hussein had recently built himself.   · To the north side of Gara Mountain, the villages of Bawarkeh Kavri and Mergeti ('Meadow of the Mulberry Tree') lay next to each other in a small valley, separated only by a 10-minute walk. The army had burned Bawarkeh Kavri four times before Anfal, but the village had always been rebuilt. The valley had been 'redlined' by the government in 1987, and both villages housed peshmerga bases.   Again, the bombing began at about 8:00 a.m. on August 25. Five or six bombs fell in Bawarkeh Kavri and nine or ten in Mergeti, witnesses said, but they struck some distance away from the KDP base. There was white smoke, and all the chickens and birds died, as did the goats. But none of the villagers lost their lives in the attack, even though those who were downwind of the gas suffered the usual symptoms--vomiting, tearing and dizziness. They ascribed their good fortune to the peshmerga, who had warned them a few days before that an attack might be imminent and showed them how to protect themselves by closing all the doors and windows and shrouding their heads in wet towels and blankets. That same evening, the villagers saw the ground forces approaching and fled to the mountains.   · It was a similar story in Sarkeh and Gizeh, neighboring villages deep in the folds of Gara Mountain, about ten miles south of the town of Amadiya. There were no guerrilla bases here, although fighters did pass through at frequent intervals. As the villagers sat down to breakfast, Mushir, a peshmerga in his early twenties, saw six aircraft discharge their bombs over Sarkeh before flying on to attack Shirana, the next village to the east. Mushir ran west toward Gizeh, the village of his birth. But it was deserted; the warplanes had already paid their visit.   'There was medicine from the airplane,' said Khadija Sa'id, an old, partially sighted woman from Gizeh. 'We noticed smoke, felt dizzyand fell down. My sister went blind. The smoke smelled like old alcohol, but the smell did not stay.'   'I felt dizzy, about to faint,' added her sister, Fahma. 'Tears were coming from my eyes, and I fell down. I tried to wash my face. I vomited. Those who vomited survived. Others died at the beginning. Now I am like this; I can see only a little bit.' The villagers of Gizeh fled to caves in the mountains, as they had in the past. On the evening of the same day, they watched ground troops enter the village and burn it to the ground.33   * * *     In psychological terms, these attacks were every bit as devastating as the regime presumably intended them to be. The raids terrified peshmerga and civilians across Badinan. With no village farther than twenty miles from the chemicals, word of them spread rapidly. The suddenness and intensity of the attack on so many fronts at once threw the KDP into disarray, and many peshmerga simply abandoned their posts to try and rescue their families and reach the border. Said one fighter,   I could not find any of my fellow peshmerga. They had all gone to help their relatives, and the chemical weapons had created a lot of fear among the people. We did not know how to fight them. We knew how to fight tanks, how to chase a military caravan until we ambushed it, and how to escape aerial bombardments. But we did not know how to fight chemicals.34   Immediately after the bombs had fallen, word reached the villages that resistance was useless. According to a young man who was a peshmerga in Spindar, the next village to the west of Swareh,   Even before the army entered our village we received a message from Mas'oud Barzani not to resist. The [KDP]leadership command told us, 'Everything has ended; the revolution is over; we cannot fight chemical weapons with our bare hands; we just cannot fight chemical weapons.' The KDP's First Branch told us, 'You have a choice: if you want to surrender, do so in order to save the civilians, because the party does not have the ability to care for so many civilian casualties.' We could not take so many elderly people and children to the border.35   Such scattered fighting as did take place after the first wave of chemical attacks cannot properly be called resistance. The best that the KDP could manage was a string of isolated rearguard actions, in which splintered groups of peshmerga tried to slow the army's advance. But their efforts were useless, for the places where the peshmerga tried to make a stand, such as the narrow defile known as Darava Shinyeh (or 'Shinyeh Passage'), were also acutely vulnerable to renewed attacks from the air. According to one KDP veteran, these battles were 'all very short ones, like pinpricks,' and military helicopters continued to harass the fleeing peshmerga throughout the next day, August 26.36   Perhaps the most cowardly of all the chemical attacks was the bombing of the bridge at Baluka, one of the main crossing points on the fast-flowing Greater Zab river. The village of Baluka itself had been emptied during the border clearances of 1976, although a few families had straggled back, accompanied by the peshmerga. Now, with the sanctuary of Turkey barely four miles away across the mountains, villagers had begun to converge on the Baluka bridge from all directions, in flight from the army. At about 1:00 p.m. on August 25, the warplanes appeared over Baluka. They released two bombs on the village and several more over the river. The bridge was quickly covered in a greenish cloud and the corpses of farm animals piled up on the bridge, making it impassable.   By nightfall on August 26, the combat was effectively over. 'The zealousness of the [army] fighters was boosted by the collapse of thesaboteurs and their complete inability to resist,' Gen. Zareb noted with satisfaction in his written report on the Final Anfal.37   In many cases, the ground troops and jahsh -- or chatta ('bandits'), as they are known in the Kurmanji-speaking areas--moved into the abandoned villages on the same day as the chemical attacks. In others, they waited a day or two. But the occupation of Badinan was effectively complete by dawn on August 28, exactly on Gen. Zareb's original schedule. Tens of thousands of refugees headed for Turkey; others were captured in their homes, or surrendered after a brief, vain attempt at flight; others hid in the mountains until the September 6 amnesty.   * * *     In coordination with the first wave of attacks, the Iraqi Army occupied the highway that runs east from the small border city of Zakho until it meets the Greater Zab river at Baluka. The idea was evidently to seal off the Turkish border and stem the flood of refugees. In this, however, the army was strikingly unsuccessful. Although many died along the way, some were caught, and others were chased and strafed by fighter aircraft, between 65,000 and 80,000 Kurds did manage to make the crossing. In the impromptu camps that a reluctant Turkish government found itself obliged to open along the border, the refugees told their stories and displayed their injuries to the few members of the foreign press who managed to gain access. Those who lived in villages south of the highway found it more difficult to escape, and a lower proportion of them reached safe havens in Turkey.38   Many of those who could not break through the blockade line along the Zakho-Baluka road still managed to evade capture by hiding out in the mountains. They watched impotently as the bulldozers crawled back and forth through the valleys below, crushing everything in their path. Along the great east-west spine of Gara Mountain, south of Amadiya, the scattered peshmerga fighters took charge of a sprawling caravan of thousands of refugees. On foot and on horseback, they travelled east for three days, but found it impossible to get across the Greater Zab, because all the bridges were now controlled by the army. Retracing their steps to the west again, the refugees heard on the radios that the peshmerga carried that thousands of their fellow Kurds had found sanctuary in Turkey. As news of the recent chemical attacks spread, the peshmerga tried to keep up the morale of the civilians by telling them that foreign pressure on the Iraqi regime would soon force Saddam Hussein to declare a halt to the fighting.   Although they had no bread or other supplies, there was meat aplenty in the form of abandoned farm animals. But the most pressing problem was the lack of drinking water: all the rivers and springs lay in the valleys below, and these were in the hands of the army and jahsh, who were shooting at anything that moved. The fugitives went for three days without water, and according to at least one account many young children died on Gara Mountain as a result of diarrhea and dehydration.39 But a surprising number did survive the ordeal, and on their twelfth day in hiding, just after the radio had broadcast noon prayers, news came that the Revolutionary Command Council had decreed a general amnesty.   Many thousands of others were less fortunate. The villagers of Gizeh, for example, which had been attacked with chemical weapons on August 25, held out in the mountains for ten days--not quite long enough to benefit from the amnesty. Starving and exhausted, they wereeventually hunted down by soldiers who made them walk for four hours to Amadiya. There they were hustled into trucks that drove off to the west, in the direction of Dohuk. Gizeh was one of the worst hit villages in the whole of Badinan: according to Mushir, the young peshmerga from Sarkeh, ninety-three of its men were captured by the army and were never heard from again. Only Mushir and two others survived.   Some were captured in their homes on the first day of the assault. Part of the population of Mergeti, on the north side of Gara Mountain, did flee immediately after the August 25 chemical attack, but almost a hundred other people, including many of the older residents, were seized as soldiers and Kurdish chatta forces reached the village that evening. The troops warned them that if there was any resistance from peshmerga in the vicinity, they would all be executed on the spot.   In Warakhal, some way to the east in the nahya of Nerwa Reikan, a local mustashar told the village elders that their people should turn themselves in to the army; since they were not peshmerga, they had nothing to fear. The villagers obeyed, and were rounded up and packed into trucks. Their first destination was the complex of Deralouk, built where the main east-west highway crosses the Greater Zab. They remained there for three hours, crowded into animal pens, before being separated by age and sex. The women counted as eighty-three men from Warakhal were loaded into IFAs and driven off. They asked the jahsh what was to become of them, but were ordered to shut up. But there is evidence that the militiamen knew the answer only too well, for some of the women heard them muttering among themselves that it would be 'a great loss for these people to disappear.'40   From this point on, the story of the Final Anfal closely parallels what had happened during earlier stages of the campaign. The captured villagers were detained, for a few hours or a few days, in temporary holding centers on or near the main east-west highway. Sometimes there was a rudimentary interrogation. Several of these processing points were complexes like Deralouk, built to house displaced Kurds during earlier periods of the Iran-Iraq War. Captives from the area around Gara Mountain were kept briefly in the complexes of Sori Jeri and Kwaneh, and in a school in Sarseng. In the town of Amadiya itself, the police station, the army base and the headquarters of the Teachers Union wereall used. The temporary facilities were badly stretched, and transportation of so many prisoners also proved to be a problem, with many of the army IFAs breaking down. One civilian truck driver told Middle East Watch that his vehicle was commandeered, along with two civilian buses, to transport fifty or sixty prisoners--men, women and children--from the army brigade headquarters in Amadiya to Sarseng, and thence to Dohuk.41   Closer to Zakho, the complexes of Bersivi and Hizawa served the same purpose. Many people also told of being taken to the army fort in Mangesh, or to a primary or intermediate school in that town, sometimes lured there by false promises of amnesty. They remained in Mangesh for up to three days. Some were given meager rations of Kurdish flat bread and sun-heated water; others received nothing at all, although sympathetic townspeople reportedly threw food in at the windows.42 After three days, the IFAs were set to move again, this time to the south, toward Dohuk.   * * *     On-the-Spot Mass Executions     In the Sorani-speaking areas of Iraqi Kurdistan, faced with orders to exterminate their prisoners on an industrial scale, the executioners were sometimes sloppy about their work. From the Third Anfal alone, the Germian campaign, at least six survivors have surfaced to tell their stories. This is not the case in Badinan, where after more than a year of intensive research Middle East Watch has been unable to find a single male who emerged alive from the camps and the firing squads.   Between April and September 1992, and again in April 1993, MEW staff travelled extensively in Badinan, conducting dozens of interviews with survivors of the Final Anfal--Khatimat al-Anfal. In eachformer village group, surviving witnesses were asked to construct a list of those who had died or disappeared. In many cases, they were able to do so, giving complete names where possible and identifying anyone who had been an active peshmerga, a draft dodger or an army deserter. The lists provided by villagers from Badinan invariably included only adult and teenage males--with the signal exception of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians, as well as Yezidi Kurds, whose fate is detailed below.   The numbers reported to MEW from thirty-six villages give some hint of the probable death toll from the Badinan campaign. Some places went unscathed, with everyone making it across the border into Turkey; some lost a single man; many a dozen or twenty; a few suffered brutally, losing almost their entire adult male population--seventy-four from the village of Ikmala in the nahya of Al-Doski, for example, either eighty-three or eighty-seven (according to two separate accounts) from the village of Warakhal in the nahya of Nerwa Reikhan, and ninety-three from Gizeh. In all, these thirty-six villages lost 632 of their menfolk to Anfal, including a few boys as young as twelve or thirteen.43   All of these men and boys were last seen alive in Iraqi Army custody, either crammed into IFA trucks, handcuffed by the roadside at their place of capture, or (predominantly) in the fort at Dohuk, which functioned, so to speak, as the Topzawa of the North.44 None of them has been seen alive since their disappearance almost five years ago, and the only possible conclusion is that they were killed en masse by firing squads, just as their predecessors had been in the earlier stages of Anfal.   Hundreds of women and young children perished, too, as a result of the Final Anfal campaign. But the causes of their death were different--gassing, starvation, exposure and wilful neglect, rather than bullets firedfrom an AK-47. In the first seven Anfal operations, the mass disappearance of women and children frequently mirrored the pattern of peshmerga resistance. In the Final Anfal, there was no resistance to speak of. The KDP was simply routed, and this may help explain why the women and children of Badinan were spared. As for their menfolk, the standing orders could not have been clearer:   'We received orders to kill all peshmerga, even those who surrendered,' Middle East Watch was told by a former lieutenant colonel in the Iraqi Army. 'Even civilian farmers were regarded as peshmerga if they were working within a prohibited area. All men in the prohibited areas, aged from 15-60 [sic], were to be considered saboteurs and killed. The prohibited areas were shown in red on the army maps, and they covered everything except the paved highways.' These orders, the officer explained, were conveyed in writing to the divisional level (tahriri) and then passed on orally to the lower-ranking officers. The reference is clearly to Northern Bureau directives 3650 and 4008 of June 1987, which contained the standing orders for the two-year period including Anfal. The lieutenant-colonel went on to explain that women and children in his own local area of operations, were to be rounded up, trucked to the army's divisional headquarters at Begova where he was stationed and then later resettled in a government complex.45   'Ali Hassan al-Majid's orders were clear,' agreed another former officer who had served in the Istikhbarat. 'They were to kill all men aged from 15-60. He did not want to see them again, they must be killed off.' However, 'people were killed according to the mood of the officer in charge. Some were good-hearted and let people go, while others killed them.'   The 'good-hearted' behavior of some officers is borne out by the testimony of witnesses. A Yezidi Kurd from the village of Mezeh (nahya of Sarseng) was among the thousands who hid out in the mountains after fleeing before the army's attack at the end of August. 'Some forty to fifty women could no longer bear the hardship,' he recalled, 'and surrendered to an army unit in Shkafkeh village. The commander, who was friendly, gave them food and water, but told them he was under orders to kill everyone. So he sent them back into the mountains, saying that he was incapable of killing women and children, and told them to wait for anamnesty.'46 Chatta units in this area also crossed peshmerga lines to warn everyone to stay where they were, since there was a general order to kill anyone who surrendered.   At least one large group of villagers was spared as the result of a private deal with the army. This startling case involved a group of 160 families from the village of Spindarok, who tried to flee toward Turkey on the first day of the Final Anfal. They had only made it as far as the main road when they encountered an important tribal leader, the father of one of the mustashars. They assured the man that there were no peshmerga in their ranks, and he in turn approached military intelligence on their behalf. The following afternoon they surrendered to the army, which trucked them to the Zakho headquarters of Istikhbarat. There they handed over their weapons and gave statements. After this they were allowed to go free, moving in with relatives in Zakho. (Their own village of Spindarok was burned and bulldozed.)47   * * *     Some of the captured men and boys of Badinan were lined up and murdered at their point of capture, executed by firing squads on the authority of a local army officer. The most notorious case is that of Koreme, a village of some 150 households just two and a half miles north of the town of Mangesh.48 Koreme was known locally as a pro-government village, and many of its men served as agents of Amn. Bythe time of Anfal, however, Koreme was already a village-in-hiding; since the previous year its population of 1,000 or so had taken refuge beneath damp rock overhangs in the ravines nearby. In the aftermath of the August 25 chemical attacks, Koreme--like innumerable other villages--held a fierce debate about what to do. By the 27th, several hundred people had decided to risk fleeing to Turkey. But later that same day other terrified villagers they encountered in the mountains warned them that they had left it too late; all routes to the border were now blocked by soldiers.   The Koreme refugees turned back, accompanied by a number of people from the village of Chalkey who had joined them in the ravines. They walked all night, in constant fear of attack. By the afternoon of August 28, they had reached the outskirts of Koreme once more. The soldiers and the jahsh, however, had got there first. As soon as they saw the troops, the men raised their hands high in the air to signal surrender.   The officers in charge, two young lieutenants in their twenties, had the villagers separated on the spot by age and sex. This done, they appeared unsure of what they should do next, but after a pause one of the lieutenants ordered a group of thirty-three men and teenage boys to stand apart from the others.49 Their ages ranged from thirteen to forty-three. As the other villagers were led away behind a hill, out of sight, the men were made to squat on their heels. The soldiers continued to tell them that no harm would come to them, and even offered them cigarettes and water. While they waited, one of the officers called his superiors in nearby Mangesh on his walkie-talkie. He reported that he had captured a group of 'armed subversives' and asked for instructions. As soon as he put the radio down, the lieutenant shouted the order to his men to open fire. Twenty-seven of the thirty-three prisoners were killed--eighteen from Koreme and nine from Chalkey. Remarkably, however, six survived--even though the soldiers later went down the line to administer the coup de grace.50 The bodies were left to lie where theyhad fallen and to rot in the hot summer sun for more than a week before soldiers returned to bury them in two shallow pits.   To this day there is considerable speculation as to why Koreme should have been singled out in this way. Of all the theories that have been floated, the most plausible may be that their former role in Amn holds the key to the mystery. As a loyalist village, Koreme would have been expected to abide by the 'redlining' of 1987 and register its inhabitants under the October census. Instead the village went into hiding. The regime would therefore have regarded its former Amn agents as especially traitorous, and captured official documents make it clear that this kind of desertion was punishable by summary execution.51   Koreme was not the only case of a mass execution in the field. Something similar took place on a smaller scale in Mergeti, the village on the northern slopes of Gara Mountain that had been attacked by chemical weapons on August 25. Most of the men were peshmerga, and they escaped to the mountain. But as we have seen, as many as one hundred villagers were captured in their homes by soldiers that same night. They were held for an hour or so by the spring that was Mergeti's only source of water. As they waited there, the soldiers set fire to their homes.   An Istikhbarat officer then reportedly called his superiors by walkie-talkie and told them that a number of 'saboteurs' had been arrested. A member of the jahsh, who was standing nearby and spoke some Arabic, quietly told the villagers what the man had been ordered to do: 'Separate the men and women and kill all the men older than fifteen.' Twelve men were made to stand aside, and at nightfall the women were taken away on foot to the nearby town of Sarseng. In the confusion and darkness, an apparently tender-hearted infantry officer managed to conceal four of the men in the larger group of women in anattempt to save them.52 The other eight were taken by their captors to the nearby village of Bawarkeh Ka'ba, away from the mountains.   The soldiers' commanding officer was furious. 'Why did you bring them here?' he shouted. 'I ordered you to kill them. Why did you not implement my orders?' The man repeated his command: the men were to be taken back to their place of capture and shot. At a spot about 300 yards outside Mergeti, the prisoners were bound together hand and feet, blindfolded and handcuffed, and shot with Kalashnikovs.53   * * *     Thanks to Brigadier General Zareb's meticulous account of troop movements during the Final Anfal, it is possible to say with some precision who was responsible for the Mergeti and Koreme murders.54 Although Mergeti is not mentioned by name in Gen. Zareb's report, the village clearly fell within the area of operations of the Iraqi Army's 41st Infantry Division. The 41st controlled a detachment of commandos from the Sixth Army Corps, as well as three infantry brigades, numbers 103, 114 and 706. The commander of one of these three brigades--it is not specified which--was in charge of the division's first joint task force that was deployed against Gara Mountain from its base in Sarseng and wouldhave moved eastward through Mergeti in the first hours of the campaign.55   Within the plan of attack devised by the Fifth Army Corps, Koreme was part of the Khabour Basin area of operations. (see map) Stretching from Zakho and Batufa in the north to Mangesh in the south, this theater was in the hands of the 29th Infantry Division. Three infantry brigades were also assigned to the operation--numbers 84, 238 and 435--together with a tank battalion, an assortment of mechanized forces, field engineers, artillery units and waterborne troops, and sixteen National Defense Battalions, or jahsh.   The campaign was further subdivided into eight joint task forces, two of which--the sixth and seventh--were based in Mangesh.56 While the seventh task force was instructed to drive eastward and take the villages of Majalmukht and Alkushki, the sixth was to move north, as far as the twin villages of upper and lower Baroshki, on the south bank of the Khabour river. A secondary detachment was to peel off to the northeast, and to take Koreme. It was this unit that carried out the executions, and from the testimonies of witnesses, the assumption must be that the order came from the sixth task force commander of the 29th Infantry Division, based in Mangesh.   Gen. Zareb was well pleased by the performance of his officers. By August 29, he was able to report that the 29th and 41st Infantry Divisions had 'occupied all [their] target places' and 'completed all the duties assigned to [them].'57 Over the course of the next week, other units and task forces continued mopping-up operations and drove the last of the peshmerga into Turkey and Iran. By September 6, the last strategic border hilltop had been occupied, and from a military point of view the Final Anfal was complete. Gen. Zareb applauded the 'military and civilian security authorities' for laying the groundwork for the successful campaign, and paid tribute to the comrades of the Ba'ath Party for 'raising the degree of enthusiasm and zealousness of the fighters.'58   The general detected the same sterling fighting qualities in the jahsh. 'The combatants of the National Defense Battalions zealously and enthusiastically fought to achieve the target of destroying the saboteurs in their positions,' he wrote. 'In all the convoys, they used to march ahead of the troops because they knew the area and also because of their good physical fitness, especially for mountain-climbing. They...played an active role in the destruction of villages and the collection of plunder.'59 There was a meticulous inventory of the 'plunder': cattle and goats; rugs, mattresses and blankets; watches, cash and pieces of gold; picture albums, eating utensils, packets of powdered milk, toothpaste...60   His forces had met 'almost no resistance,' the general reported, and this was reflected in the army's casualty figures. Only thirty-one men died in the Final Anfal, and eighteen of those were jahsh, who had dutifully played the role of cannon fodder assigned to them by the army and the Ba'ath Party. As for the 'saboteurs' taken into army custody during the Badinan campaign, they were listed as follows:   Saboteurs Surrendered 803   Saboteurs Captured 771   Men 1,489   Women 3,368   Children 6,964   Total 13,395   Others, of course, had died in the field. But these were not tallied accurately, with the exception of forty-eight peshmerga reported killed in clashes with the 29th Division. Instead, Gen. Zareb contented himself with a terse notation: 'Too many bloodstains were seen in all the places cleaned by our forces.'   * * *     The Fort at Dohuk and the Women's Prison at     Salamiyeh     The Dohuk Fort squats by the roadside at Nizarkeh, on the eastern outskirts of the capital of the governorate. It is a huge concrete structure, built of Soviet design in the 1970s and protected by a battery of four anti-aircraft guns on the roof. Of the 13,395 'saboteurs' captured in Badinan, most were taken to the fort, trucked there in army IFAs from their place of capture. Some male prisoners from the southern part of Badinan were reportedly also taken to the city of Mosul, but no one has apparently returned alive to tell the story of what happened there.   Most of the inmates were held on the second floor of the fort, which was so crowded that the prisoners spilled over into the corridors. They stayed in Dohuk between two and five days, although some old people were kept there longer, for periods of as much as a couple of weeks. Some women spent the whole of the first night in the courtyard of the fort, confined to the same trucks that had brought them. As in Topzawa, the newcomers were segregated on arrival: men and boys of military service age to one side and women, children and the elderly to the other. Soldiers took brief statements from the men and confiscated their IDs, but no one else was questioned. With their customary fondness for keeping documentary records, security agents made videotapes of these brief interrogation sessions.   As their wives and sisters stood by, powerless to help, the men were beaten with wooden batons and lengths of plastic tubing, kicked, punched and slapped. Army guards amused themselves by putting lighted matches to the prisoners' beards and mustaches. Children screamed and tried to run to their fathers, but were driven back with kicks and blows. Iram, a young woman from Gizeh, on Gara Mountain, watched as soldiers beat her brother-in-law bloody. She begged them, 'by God and by the Prophet,' to let her cross the courtyard to wash his wounds. The soldiers refused. 'You have no God and no Prophet,' they sneered.61   When the registration process was completed, the prisoners were dispersed to filthy communal cells that were strewn with human waste. 'It was like living in a toilet,' one elderly woman recalled in disgust. There were thousands in the fort, men packed into the ground level cells and women, children and the elderly on the floor above. Hundreds morearrived each day. They were from all the major tribes of the Badinan area--Doski, Sindi, Reikan, Barwari, Sleivani and others. Several hundred of the prisoners were from Yezidi and Assyrian Christian villages, and these people were segregated from the Muslim detainees by a partition wall.   In many respects the conditions at Nizarkeh were even more squalid than at Topzawa. Most strikingly, there was no attempt to feed the inmates. Although there were faucets in the courtyard, guards barred the prisoners from using them. Small amounts of insanitary, sun-warmed water were available from barrels in the yard, but there was no effort to distribute this systematically. There was not even bread. 'You Kurds have been sent here to die,' was the comment that many prisoners reported hearing from their guards.   Small gestures of sympathy from local townspeople helped to ward off starvation--something that happened at a number of other detention facilities for Kurds during Anfal. Once, a Kurdish guard dumped two sacks of bread in the courtyard, and the fitter children scrambled for these. But other children, and some of the older adults, did succumb to hunger and disease. As many as twenty died in one two-day period in early September, according to one account.62 Over time, the longer-term elderly inmates were able to buy food from their jailers, in the same way as their fellow Kurds in Nugra Salman. When only the elderly remained, security also became more lax, and some relatives even managed to slip inside the fort for brief visits. At night the prisoners would slip out to the barbed wire perimeter fence to collect large plastic sacks of food that the people of Dohuk left there.63   For the younger inmates, the guards' brutality continued as a matter of daily routine. New arrivals saw recent bloodstains on the floors and walls. Any woman attempting to visit her husband on the lower levelof the fort was beaten back. Men were savagely beaten with pruning hooks of the sort that Kurds customarily use in their fields. One overweight young man was pummeled senseless, stuffed into the trunk of a Volkswagen Passat and driven out of the fort. He was not seen again. Others were pounded on the head and upper body with concrete blocks, sometimes when they were tied to posts in the courtyard. 'I saw it myself when officers killed one young man with such a block,' said an old man from the Amadiya area. 'I cried and prayed to God to save us all.'64   On another occasion, a prisoner saw soldiers and Istikhbarat officers taking turns to beat a group of twelve young men in peshmerga dress. The army men were yelling and cursing them: 'Are you not ashamed of being saboteurs, donkeys, sons of dogs!' Later, the witness saw the bloodied bodies of the twelve young men being dragged away by soldiers. He was told by a guard that they were peshmerga who had surrendered or been captured by helicopter on Mattin Mountain.65   Another young man who was a carpenter in Dohuk learned that a friend's father was among the detainees in the fort, and rushed there immediately with sacks of bread and grapes. At the gate of the fort he asked an Amn agent for permission to enter. 'How could you go in?' the man asked. 'You'll get beaten. Let me show you what happened to some of the people in there.' The Amn man took the carpenter to a patch of lower ground outside the fort and pointed to a number of bloodstains, as well as what appeared to be the remains of human brains. The guard explained that these belonged to people from the villages of Spindar and Swareh, on the slopes of Gara Mountain. Eighteen of them had been killed here, summarily executed.66   After a few days in this hellish atmosphere, the first groups of women and children were told to assemble in the huge central courtyard, where vehicles were waiting to take them away to a new destination. Sometimes these were closed buses with two small windows in the rear,sometimes minibuses or coasters, sometimes ordinary army IFAs. Armed guards--identified as Amn and Istikhbarat--waited to accompany the convoys. The final images that the women took with them from Nizarkeh were of the continued sufferings of their menfolk. As one group waited to depart, they saw cursing soldiers beating a number of men in the courtyard with cement blocks and sticks. The men were blindfolded and handcuffed. As the buses pulled away, one woman cried, 'Let our children die too, now that their fathers are dead.'67 And in the days that followed, the older inmates of the Dohuk Fort saw more buses come--some of them khaki-colored, others blue--to take away the younger men.68 With hardly an exception, they have never been seen again.   * * *     The vehicles carrying the women and children headed south toward Mosul, before turning on to the Baghdad road. In one truck, a pregnant woman from the Amadiya area began to go into labor. The other women yelled at the driver to stop, but he refused, and a belligerent soldier aimed a kick at the pregnant woman. But as the crowded truck continued to bump along the highway, she gave birth to her baby. The child survived, and they called it Hawar, or 'scream.'   About five hours after leaving Dohuk, the convoys pulled up outside a prison, or military base, in the small town of Salamiyeh, on the east bank of the Tigris a few miles south of Mosul. On arrival, there was a brief registration process and Istikhbarat, which had overseen the Dohuk Fort, handed the women and children over into the custody of new guards, whom witnesses identified as belonging to the Iraqi police and Popular Army. The prisoners found themselves in a huge single-story building, divided into perhaps two dozen large, overcrowded halls, each some fifty yards in length. Every hall held people from a particular region, but all the inmates were from Badinan; not a word of Sorani washeard. Here the women were to stay for anything between ten days and two weeks.   The prison regime at Salamiyeh was a distinct improvement on the Nizarkeh fort, and none of the women reported being specifically harassed or abused. Recollections of Salamiyeh varied from case to case. Perhaps memory is dimmed by time and trauma; on the other hand, it may well be that prison conditions changed over time. Some women recalled a diet of nothing but 'hard, rough bread' and water from tanks in the yard; other said that they received three meals a day, including bread, rice, soup and jam, and that water was readily available from faucets. There were even iceblocks to counter the summer heat, and a small prison shop that sold a few basic staples. Although there was no soap, the women could wash their clothes each day in the courtyard.   Even so, conditions at Salamiyeh were grim. The prisoners were detained here with no semblance of legal process; no charges were ever brought against them, and they were never given any reason for their confinement. Women and children slept on the bare concrete floor without blankets and used filthy, overflowing toilets. The inmates of different halls were forbidden to communicate with each other. There was no medical attention, and at least two deaths were reported during the two weeks that the Salamiyeh prison was in service. One of the dead was a child from Gizeh village, who was crushed beneath a water tank. Soldiers removed the body, and refused to tell the child's mother where they were taking it.   Above all the women suffered the constant mental torment of not knowing what had become of their husbands and brothers. At least two witnesses said that some of the Badinan men were taken for a time to Salamiyeh, although they were held in separate quarters. One woman from the nahya of Guli learned from the guards that her husband and three brothers were alive in the prison. Another, who was held in Hall No.7 with other prisoners from the Sarseng area, found one day that the steel door of her cell had been locked. It remained that way for six days. On the sixth morning, it was left open for two hours. From her vantage point close to the door, the woman had a partial view of the courtyard outside. 'I saw men, blindfolded with their hands cuffed behind them,' she told Middle East Watch. 'They were wearing Kurdish cummerbunds and headscarves (jamadani).' It was the first time she had been aware of male prisoners at Salamiyeh. 'I saw those men being put into military vehicles, closed vehicles with only a small hole in the back.' As each pairof vehicles was loaded up, they drove away. Another two took their place, then another two, and another. She saw many men moved out of Salamiyeh in this way. She surmised that this had been going on during the six days that the door of Hall No.7 had remained locked: 'It had to be for a purpose; otherwise the doors were always left open.'69   Shortly after the removal of these blindfolded male prisoners, there was a sudden burst of gunfire. But it turned out to be nothing more ominous than joyful guards letting off their weapons into the air. President Saddam Hussein had declared a general amnesty, they told the women. Now their husbands would be safe. There was to be music, a big party. They even expected the Kurdish women to dance with them.   ______   1 Cordesman and Wagner, op. cit. p.3, calculate that there were between 450,000 and 730,000 Iranian and between 150,000 and 340,000 Iraqi deaths.

Zewa Shkan housed the first lak; the second lak, based in the Smaquli Valley, handled operations in Erbil governorate; the third, in the Qara Dagh village of Ja'faran, ran KDP affairs in al-Ta'mim (Kirkuk) governorate; and the fourth, in the Chwarta area, was responsible for Suleimaniyeh. The KDP also had special units known as the Barzan Forces in Hayat (nahya Mergasur).

The definitive work on the subject is Martin Van Bruinessen, Agha, Shaikh and State, op. cit..   7 Van Bruinessen, 'The Kurds Between Iran and Iraq,' p.27.   8 A. Sherzad, 'The Kurdish Movement in Iraq, 1975-1988,' in Kreyenbroek and Sperl, eds., The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, p.138.   9 The Army estimated that the KDP itself had between 1,800 and 2,000 fighters in Badinan, divided into a half-dozen local committees. In addition to the KDP, there was a unit of 250-300 PUK peshmerga in the valley of Zewa Shkan, close to the Turkish border and northeast of the summer resort of Amadiya; 200-220 combatants of the Iraqi Communist Party; and seventy 'saboteurs' of the Kurdistan Popular Democratic Party of Sami Abd-al-Rahman, a KDP breakaway group. The KDP continues to dispute the accuracy of the army figures. According to senior KDP officials, the organization's combat strength on the eve of Anfal was 8,000, with an additional 36,000 villagers formally registered as members of the civilian 'backing force.'

In 1982 the two governments signed an agreement authorizing Turkey to send its armed forces into Iraq in pursuit of rebel Turkish Kurds or in joint operations with the Iraqi Army against Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga. See The Economist, June 18, 1983.   17 According to surveys by the Kurdistan Development and Reconstruction Society (KURDS), a local relief agency.   18 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, September 4, 1992.   19 Middle East Watch interview, Zakho, September 1, 1992.   20 Even in internal communications, the Iraqi government evidently treated the matter of its chemical weapons with the utmost secrecy. Letter no. Sh 5/19299 from the Amn director of the governorate of Erbil to all branches, dated December 17, 1988 and classified 'secret and personal for addressee only,' reads: 'Pursuant to the memorandum from the Honorable Office of the Presidency, no. 4/4/11/44154 of December 4, 1988, a decision has been taken to give all letters (memoranda) which contain information about the production of chemical weapons the highest degree of secrecy. Take all necessary measures, keep this memorandum to yourself, and sign for its receipt.'   21 One mustashar did allege that chemical artillery was used against the village of Warmilleh, but this could not be confirmed in interviews with residents. Middle East Watch interview, Zakho, September 1, 1992. On the events in Warmilleh, see below pp.272-273.   22 There have also been persistent rumors about Iraq's use of biological weapons, including reports of mysterious and localized outbreaks of disease in peshmerga-controlled areas. At least one document proves that the Iraqi Army did possess stockpiles of such weapons. In a 'highly confidential and personal' letter no. H1277, dated August 8, 1986, Erbil district commander Gen. Abd-al-Wahab Izzat instructs all units in his area to carry out a half-yearly stocktaking of all biological and chemical agents in their possession.   23 Galbraith and Van Hollen, op. cit., pp.1, 42. Their list appears to include a number of villages that were affected by windborne gas from other locations. A persistent difficulty in documenting Iraqi chemical attacks is in distinguishing primary sites from other places suffering the secondary effects, and the list on   pp. 323-327 includes only proven primary targets. This is not only a problem of methodology; it is also the most vivid illustration of the indiscriminate character of these weapons.   24 Soil samples from Birjinni were collected on June 10, 1992 by a forensic team assembled by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) and Middle East Watch. They were subsequently analyzed at the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment of Great Britain's Ministry of Defence at Porton Down, and found to contain trace evidence of the nerve gas GB, also known as Sarin, as well as of mustard gas. See the PHR-Human Rights Watch statement, 'Scientific First: Soil Samples Taken from Bomb Craters in Northern Iraq Reveal Nerve Gas--Even Four Years Later,' April 29, 1993.   25 A full account of the chemical attack on Birjinni is contained in Middle East Watch/Physicians for Human Rights, The Anfal Campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan: The Destruction of Koreme, pp. 31-44.   26 Middle East Watch interview, Gri Gowr complex, August 27, 1992.   27 Middle East Watch interviews, Hizawah complex and Zakho, September 1, 1992.   28 Middle East Watch interview, Warmilleh village, August 31, 1992.   29 Middle East Watch interview, Batufa, April 9, 1993.   30 Middle East Watch interview, Batufa, April 9, 1993.   31 A number of Middle East Watch interviews produced strikingly similar lists of the villages attacked with chemicals along Gara Mountain: to the northern side, Dehukeh, Bawarkeh Kavri, Mergeti, Havintka, Birozana, Drisheh, Mijeh, Kavna Mijeh, Spindar Khalfo and Geyrgash; on the mountain itself, Garagu, Goreh, Zewa Shkan, Baluti, Gizeh, Zarkeh, Razikeh, Sarkeh, Rodinya, Shirana and Ikmala; and on the southern side, Spindar, Swareh, Avok and others.   32 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 10, 1992.   33 Middle East Watch interviews, Jezhnikan complex, May 3, 1992 and Sarseng, April 11, 1993.   34 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 6, 1992.   35 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 2, 1992.   36 Middle East Watch interview, Amadiya, August 29, 1992. According to this fighter, the helicopter attacks included the renewed use of chemical weapons.   37 'Analysis: Operation End of Anfal,' p.39.   38 It is clear that a very serious incident occurred either in the Bazeh gorge, through which thousands of civilians fled in an attempt to cross the main Zakho-Baluka road, or in nearby Bazeh village, a peshmerga headquarters. During their September 1988 interviews with refugees in Turkey, Galbraith and Van Hollen spoke with two people who reported witnessing a massacre of some 1,300 people, including women in children, in Bazeh village. According to these accounts, the victims were machinegunned and then buried in mass graves dug by bulldozers. The British film-maker Gwynne Roberts interviewed two teenage refugees in Turkey, who claimed to have witnessed a chemical attack on the Bazeh gorge in which 'more than 3,000' people died. According to one of these witnesses,'thousands of soldiers with gas masks and gloves' entered the gorge the next day, dragging the bodies into piles and setting fire to them. However, Middle East Watch interviews in Bazeh and surrounding villages turned up no recollection of such an event four years later. Neither were there any reports of significant deaths or disappearances of women and children that might have occurred during an attack such as those described. Exactly what took place at Bazeh remains an enigma.   39 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, September 7, 1992.   40 Middle East Watch interviews, Jezhnikan complex, May 3 and July 13, 1992.   41 Middle East Watch interview, Amadiya, August 29, 1992. Gen. Zareb, in his 'Analysis: Operation End of Anfal,' acknowledged the problem of frequent vehicle breakdowns.   42 There is a brief account of conditions at the fort in Mangesh in The Destruction of Koreme, p.58.   43 According to a dossier compiled by the Kurdistan Reconstruction and Development Society, some 310 villages were destroyed in the Dohuk governorate during the Final Anfal. The internal Iraqi Army figure for the total number of males taken into custody during the Final Anfal, including 'saboteurs' who surrendered or were captured, is 3,063. See below p.289. The pattern of male disappearances from villages surveyed by Middle East Watch suggests that the total numbers may be rather higher.   44 It should be noted, however, that at least some of the Dohuk prisoners were subsequently transferred to Topzawa, which remained in operation to the very end of the Anfal campaign.   45 Middle East Watch interview, Zakho, June 24, 1992.   46 The commander himself is extremely unlikely to have been under orders to kill all those he apprehended, regardless of age or gender, since there are no documented instances of this occurring. If this report of his comments is accurate, he may have had in mind what would happen later to those he handed over into the custody of Amn and Istikhbarat. Middle East Watch interview, Khaneq complex, August 27, 1992.   47 In a curious footnote to this story, the families were detained after the September 6 amnesty by Amn, which sent them on via the fort at Dohuk to the complex of Baharka--entirely in line with the bureaucratic logic of Anfal. Middle East Watch interview, Hizawa complex, September 1, 1992.   48 The story of this village is told in considerable detail in The Destruction of Koreme, especially pp.12-29, 45-52.   49 There was some debate among the villagers as to whether all the members of this group had been carrying weapons when they surrendered. See The Destruction of Koreme, pp.45-47.   50 The sloppiness of the Koreme execution was remarkable in itself. Even more surprising was the fact that one of the six who survived, a 34-year old man, was wounded by the gunfire, but removed to the hospital in Mangesh the nextday by a jahsh unit. He was treated there and eventually transferred to the fort at Dohuk--which he also, inexplicably, survived. See The Destruction of Koreme, pp.51-52.   51 According to Ba'ath Party membership forms found in the Iraqi government archives, merely concealing prior membership in another political party constituted grounds for the death penalty.   52 These four were later disappeared from the fort at Dohuk, according to a Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 9, 1992.   53 This account is based on the testimony to relatives of one of the eight men, who was wounded in the shooting, escaped temporarily to a nearby jahsh post in the complex of Qadish, but was later handed over by his fearful family to Amn in Sarseng. From there he disappeared.

So, by a curious quirk, did at least two younger men who were confined with the elderly because of their injuries. One was the wounded survivor of the execution squad at Koreme; the other was a man suffering from the effects of the poison gas attack on Warmilleh, the only adult male to survive from that village.

They said it was unjust to waste bread on us.'   -- Rahman Hamid Nader of Darbarou village, Taqtaq, on his release from Nugra Salman prison.    Decree no. 736 of the Revolutionary Command Council was read out on the radio early on the afternoon of September 6, just after the mid-day prayers. It declared 'a general and comprehensive amnesty for all Iraqi Kurds...both inside and outside of Iraq'--with the sole exception of 'the traitor Al-Talabani...because of his wilful and repeated violations of law and order, even after he was granted opportunities to reform his ways.' Ali Hassan al-Majid was infuriated by the amnesty, he later told aides, but went along with it as a loyal party man.1   The optimists among the peshmerga believed that the amnesty came as the result of outside pressure, that the regime of Saddam Hussein had been compelled to back down by the international reaction to revelations that chemical weapons had been used during the Final Anfal. But such outrage as there was over the Badinan attacks was not a significant contributing factor to the amnesty. The most scathing comments, and those likely to have had the greatest influence on Iraq, came from U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. But these comments were not made until September 8, a full two days after the amnesty hadbeen declared.2 It is clear from the Fifth Corps report on the Final Anfal that the decision to declare a general amnesty was made because Baghdad was convinced by September 6 that the peshmerga forces had been crushed. In the words of the press release that accompanied the amnesty, 'These [traitorous] Kurds had relinquished control of their cities and villages to Khomeini's troops, but God foiled their evil plans.'3   The next day, September 7, the Presidential Cabinet issued an additional order granting Ali Hassan al-Majid and the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath Party special powers to facilitate the return of refugees from Turkey, where their stories had been causing Iraq considerable embarrassment and annoyance--despite the best efforts of the Turkish government to minimize the tragedy.4   The refugees would only be allowed to return at two approved entry points, where special reception camps would be set up. One was the Ibrahim Khalil international bridge outside Zakho. The other site was 'to be determined by the First Army Corps with all due swiftness.' After processing by a newly constituted Returnee Reception Committee (Lajnet Istiqbal al-'A'idin), which would operate under Ba'ath Party control, the refugees would be assigned to complexes. There, they would have the responsibility of building their own homes; the plot allocated to them would become their property free of charge after five years--'on conditionthat the family receives a favorable assessment by the Party and Security authorities of its conduct from the point of view of loyalty.'5   Once the assignment to a mujamma'a had been made, the Kurds who returned under the amnesty would not be allowed to move. They were obliged, in fact, to sign or affix their thumbprint to a sworn statement which read: 'I, the undersigned (....) testify that I live in the governorate of (....), in the section of (....), residence number (....), and I recognize that I will face the death penalty should the information indicated be false, or should I alter my address without notifying the appropriate administration and authorities. To this I affirm my support.'6   The refugees were granted only until 6:00 p.m. on October 9, barely a month, to 'return to the national ranks.' Anyone who surrendered to the government after this grace period had expired would be taken into military custody and handed over to the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau Command--for what purpose it was not stated.7   A flurry of other decrees followed, for although the regime spoke of a 'general' amnesty, it by no means intended that all Kurds should escape further punishment. First, on September 8, the Revolutionary Command Council decreed that any amnestied Iraqi Kurds who had been affiliated with the armed forces, the domestic security services or the jahshwere henceforth discharged and barred from re-enlisting as volunteers.8 The authorities were also worried that those 'returning to the national ranks' would offer fertile soil for any attempt at reorganization by the peshmerga--even if the 'saboteurs' seemed, for the time being, to present no further threat. Accordingly, Ali Hassan al-Majid resolved that it was necessary for those who benefited from the amnesty to have their civil rights radically curtailed and their activities strictly monitored. 'Kurdish citizens shall be treated by the same standards applied to any other Iraqi citizen in so far as their rights and duties are concerned,' the Northern Bureau ordered, 'with the exception of those Kurds who benefited from the amnesty decree no. 736 of September 8, 1988.'   These shall not be treated on an equal footing with other Iraqis in terms of rights and duties, unless they can effectively match good intentions with proper conduct and demonstrate that they have ended all collaboration with the saboteurs, and that they are more loyal to Iraq than their peers who have benefited from the above-mentioned amnesty decree.   In dealing with such cases, the following parameters shall apply:   1: These Kurds shall not be entitled to be nominated for membership in the National Assembly (Al-Majlis al-Watani), the Legislature (Al-Majlis al-Tashri'i), the People's Councils (Majlis al-Sha'ab), the Municipal Councils (Majlis al-Baladiya) or mass organizations.   2: Those Kurds who took advantage of the Amnesty Decree shall not be entitled to sell, buy or lease state lands or concerns for which ownership is attributed to the state. Nor shall they be entitled to enter into any contract with any state organ or to engage in private business, whether as professionals or workers, until a period of two years has elapsed since their return to the national ranks.   3: The competent authorities will monitor the behavior of those who benefited from the amnesty decree, and will determine their inclinations through the placement of thorough and diligent informers in their midst.9   In its attempt to understand the thinking of the few 'saboteurs' who survived, Amn scrutinized a communique in which the Kurdish opposition-in-exile gave its response to the general amnesty decree.10 Kurdish propagandists were presenting the decree as a victory, Amn reported; it had been issued 'to try and absorb part of the resentment inside the country, and to ease the worldwide campaign of protest.' In the wake of its crushing of the Kurds, the regime no doubt found this show of bravado amusing. 'The subject has been brought to the attention of the Struggling Comrade Ali Hassan al-Majid, Secretary General of the Northern Bureau,' the Amn report concluded, 'and his excellency's view of the matter was this: that those who betray Iraq or remain abroad should no longer be entitled to keep their nationality.'11   * * *     Guards broke the news of the amnesty to the women and children at the Dibs army base and the Salamiyeh prison, to the old people who had survived the summer in Nugra Salman, and to the last groups of prisoners who remained at the Popular Army camp of Topzawa. Refugees in Iran and Turkey learned of the amnesty from Baghdad Radio and reported by the thousand to army border posts. According to former field officers in Badinan, the order came down instructing them no longer to kill their prisoners.12 Even fighters returning from Iran were not mistreated at the border. One group of former peshmerga who turned themselves in at the military base at Piramagroun, close to the destroyed PUK headquarters at Sergalou, was briefly questioned before being released. 'We were asked about the size of our forces, the kinds of weapons we used, and our reasons for fleeing to Iran. They asked us what we wanted. I answered that we were Kurds and that we wanted our rights. The government gave us one document to get us through the checkpoints, and another that gave us permission to be in the new mujamma'at where we had been assigned to live.'13   One group, however, seems to have been singled out for a harsher welcome. These were the draft dodgers and deserters who had eluded capture in the mountains, warding off starvation by eating wild grasses and the crops that had been left in the fields outside abandoned and bulldozed villages. Some of these Kurds were returned to their old units and detained for as long as five months--in the custody, ironically, of the same army that had 'Anfalized' their families and destroyed their homes. One group of sixty deserters from the Shwan area surrendered to the army in Kirkuk after four months on the run. Each man was given a letter to his old military unit and detained at that unit's base. 'We were put in small overcrowded rooms with no space to sleep and very little food, and soldiers and officers beat me with cables,' said Rezgar, a young man who was imprisoned at the army's Khaled camp, outside Erbil. From here, he was transferred to a training camp in the city, where he spent weeks being drilled and listening to lectures from a Kurdish officer on the virtues of the Ba'ath Party. ''What good is theBa'ath Party?' we asked. 'If the Ba'ath Party is so good, where are our families and our villages?' They had no answer to this.' After two months the men were released, but not before the army confiscated ten dinars (then $30) from each of them--'for the rebuilding of Fao,' scene of the costliest battle of the Iran-Iraq War.14   Dispersal of the Camp Survivors     For the inmates of Topzawa, Dibs and Nugra Salman, the regime used two principal dispersal points, and a number of secondary ones. Most of the detainees were abandoned either in Suleimaniyeh city or in nearby Arbat. A few were taken on as far as Chamchamal, where they were eventually resettled in the new Shoresh complex, or to Kalar, where their final home would be the complex of Sumoud. One old woman from the Taqtaq area reported being left off a little closer to her former home, at a government building in Dukan. Officials there asked her only a few questions. Had her sons been peshmerga? they wanted to know:   'No,' she replied, 'they are with the government.'   'Al-hamdu lillah,' the men replied. Thanks be to God.   * * *     'Stand in line, you criminals,' a guard snapped at the several thousand elderly inmates who had survived the rigors of Nugra Salman. 'You must remember this experience forever, and you shall never think of doing anything against our leader, Saddam Hussein. You have been granted amnesty.' The Amn guards registered their names once more and began to sort everyone out into different groups. It was time to get rid of these useless people by dumping them in the cities, the loathsome Lt. Hajjaj was heard to remark.15   The prisoners were released from Nugra Salman at weekly intervals. Convoys of vehicles arrived every Saturday, and took them away in fearful and crying groups of about five hundred at a time. Occasionally army IFAs were used, sometimes windowless military transports of the kind used for the mass execution victims, but more often large civilian buses--'open and pleasant' vehicles with seats, accommodating fifty or sixty people each. The lame, the blind and the infirm were the first to be allowed to leave. If a person was sick or ailing, then his or her entire family was let go from Nugra Salman at the same time.   The final releases from 'the pit of Salman' were not complete until well into November. One woman who left at the end of October said that many of those who remained were originally from the Qara Dagh or Halabja areas.16 But the greatest mystery surrounds the two large groups of women and children from southern Germian, who had been brought here from Dibs--the first after about six weeks, and the second not until August. Numbering about five hundred in all, they were held in separate quarters at Nugra Salman and forbidden to have any contact with the elderly prisoners. During their detention, dozens reportedly died of starvation and disease.   The survivors of this group were the last to be released from Nugra Salman, with the exception of three old men from the Kifri area of southern Germian who refused to go until their daughters went too. 'When I was released [in November],' said a teenage girl from Omerbel, 'there was no one left there. We were the last ones.'17 Yet some of the group were never accounted for, such as two adult women and four children from the village of Benaka (nahya of Tilako). Their disappearances added to the already immense weight of tragedy that struck this part of southern Germian in the wake of the Third Anfal.   After release from Nugra Salman, the first stop was sometimes Topzawa, sometimes Samawa. Sometimes the buses and their Amn guards travelled north in dog-legged fashion, stopping in both places. Many of those who were processed through Topzawa had the unnerving experience of passing once more through the same building--even in some cases spending a night in the same cell--that had housed them on their outward journey several months earlier. Others had their namestaken one more time at the Kirkuk office of the Ba'ath Party. Some of the deportees were issued with new ID papers that bore the words 'Affected by Anfal Operations.'18   At Samawa, the nearest town to Nugra Salman, the newly released prisoners spent anywhere from an hour to a week. The fittest of them paused only briefly to have their names registered yet again. Those who were sick were 'treated very kindly' by army personnel in an empty school or in the wards of an old military hospital. Everyone was cleaned up; the old men were shaved. 'We looked like monsters,' commented an old man from the nahya of Aghjalar, 'we had to be made presentable.'19 After the privations of Nugra Salman, the diet was almost too rich. There was meat, fruit and rice. 'They wanted to show that the government was treating us well,' remembered a middle-aged man from the Qara Dagh region. 'We were given medicine and good food, like chicken and fish. The guards told us we had to sing and enjoy ourselves. The government is nice, they told us; it is going to set you free.'20   On arrival at Suleimaniyeh and Arbat, there was one final name check. Fingerprints were taken, release papers signed. In the provincial capital some of the prisoners were taken to a security building 'like a big hospital,' where friendly city residents tossed food in over the high walls. Others ended up at the Suleimaniyeh soccer stadium, where the huge crowds were divided into groups according to their nahya of origin and told that they were free to go--anywhere but to their home villages (which, in any case, no longer existed). Anyone who strayed into the prohibited areas, one group was warned, 'will be taken in a helicopter to heaven and dropped to the ground, or executed without trial.'21   At the Ba'ath Party office in Arbat, the message was the same. Here, a few prisoners were asked to fill in questionnaires about their family members and issued with new papers. 'Do you know why you were released?' one Ba'ath 'comrade' asked a man from the Kalar area. 'Because God saved me,' the man answered. After some brief ritual questioning of this sort, the deportees were told that they should now proceed to 'modern villages'--mujamma'at--such as Sumoud and Bayinjan, where they would be given good housing.   The few who were driven on to Chamchamal had a somewhat different experience. Here, the newcomers were received by the qaym maqam, the civilian head of the qadha of Chamchamal. There were the usual harsh warnings: 'They told us not to go to the villages, it was forbidden. We could not go beyond the paved highway. If they found us out there, we would be punished.'22 New housing would be made available in local complexes such as Shoresh and Benaslawa. But more significantly, the prisoners could not go free until local citizens vouched for them and agreed to take them temporarily into their homes. In some cases these guarantees were demanded for prisoners in groups of four. There was no shortage of guarantors: the residents of Chamchamal distinguished themselves once more, as they had during the April protest to free the Anfal prisoners, by their spontaneous display of generosity toward their fellow Kurds.   * * *     The Mujamma'a Dumping Operation     The survivors of Anfal ended up in more than a dozen complexes, according to their place of origin. Those from the southern part of Germian gravitated above all to Sumoud ('Steadfastness'), the large complex outside the town of Kalar. Most people from northern Germian found their way to Shoresh ('Revolution'), on the outskirts of Chamchamal. Those from the Lesser Zab Valley were mainly relocated in Benaslawa and Daratou, on the plain south of Erbil. But the harshest fate of all awaited the survivors of the Final Anfal in Badinan, who were dumped in their tens of thousands on the barren earth north of Erbil.   Sumoud and Shoresh had both existed in rudimentary form since a year before Anfal, having been laid out originally to house the relocated inhabitants of the 1987 program of village clearances in Germian and the Erbil plain. As Anfal swept through these areas in 1988, many fleeingvillagers found refuge in the two complexes, though without official permission. After the September amnesty, both were enormously expanded to house the survivors. According to estimates of the Kurdish administration, the population of Sumoud had grown by 1992 to 50,000, 85 percent of whom were Anfalakan. Shoresh was even larger. Subdivided into four geographical areas, it housed 60,000 people, including the entire population of the former district center of Qader Karam, who were brought here after the town was bulldozed in May 1988. Fully seventy percent of those housed in Shoresh were Anfal survivors.23   The word 'housed' may give a misleading impression, for all that the new arrivals ever received from the Ba'ath government was a piece of paper giving them nominal title (subject to good behavior) to a small plot of land and, in a few cases, a bare cement floor. 'Build your house,' a former inmate of Nugra Salman was told when he was released in Kalar. 'But how could I build?' he asked Middle East Watch rhetorically. 'I had no children, no son, no food, no money, no mats.'24 Gradually, however, two squalid townships came into existence, with rough cinderblock homes and eventually electric power lines and running water. The complexes were controlled by police and army posts, and no one could venture beyond the perimeter without an official pass.   To this arrangement there was no alternative. The villages and their adjoining farmlands were prohibited, on pain of death, and Iraqi government files contain many references to individuals and groups of people executed after being found in 'prohibited' areas in the post-Anfal period as residents of the towns left standing after Anfal were warned over loudspeakers that anyone sheltering Anfalakan would be punished. The sweeps even went into the cities, especially Suleimaniyeh; most, if not all, of the families in the complexes had lost their male breadwinners, and there was no question of compensation for the lives, homes and property that had been destroyed and pillaged. There was also no foodwithout ration cards. Entitlement to these had been based on the 1987 census; each person's card, stamped with the seal of the Ba'ath Party, was marked with the village and nahya of residence. Now they could only be obtained by registering as a resident of one of the complexes--or by the time-honored means of bribery. Some residents of the mujamma'a of Ber Hoshter were reportedly told by Ba'ath officials that they would receive food and other privileges if they joined the ruling Party.25 Those who did so found that the promise was an empty one.   Many Anfalakan also found it impossible to obtain new identity documents, without which there could be no public sector employment, no education for the children, no access to health care, or other government services. According to one Anfal widow who was shuttled between the complexes of Shoresh and Jedideh Zab:   When I went to look for a job, I was told that Anfal families were not allowed to work. At the school, I was told that Anfal families could not register their children. At the hospital, we were denied treatment for the same reason. I wanted to get IDs for my children, but the authorities were not allowed to issue them. At the school they told me I needed a citizenship card for the children. They sent me to Chamchamal and Erbil, and from there to Baghdad, to the Secretary General of Amn. I finally got a letter saying my husband was lost in Anfal, but this was less of a help than a hindrance. It marked me. The police station at the Jedideh Zab complex told me this letter should make things easier for me, but when people saw it I was always turned down.26   * * *     A half-dozen camps--for want of a better word--straggled across the barren, windswept scrubland northeast of the city of Erbil. At a Northern Bureau meeting on September 7, Ali Hassan al-Majid decidedto have the survivors of the Badinan campaign trucked to this inhospitable area from the prison at Salamiyeh, from the fort at Dohuk, from the smaller army posts at Atrush and Aqra, and from the Turkish border, where they had now begun to arrive in response to the previous day's amnesty. The largest single contingent was to be dumped, in many cases at dead of night, on a patch of wasteland near the complex of Baharka. The site came to be known as Jezhnikan, after a nearby Kurdish village destroyed in an earlier army campaign. Over time, the twin settlements of Baharka-Jezhnikan, housing 4,241 families, effectively merged into one single, huge complex.27   There was nothing here to welcome the new arrivals: just bare earth, thorn bushes and guard towers with machine guns. It was September, and while the days still brought fierce heat, the nighttime chill heralded the approach of winter. There was no protection from the elements. 'They gave us nothing, we had to sleep on the ground, we were starving,' said one man who came to Baharka.28 With no infrastructure, no food or water, no housing or shelter, it was clearly a matter of complete indifference to the planners of Anfal whether these deportees lived or died, and the camp guards frequently told them as much.   Yet most of them survived as the result of a prodigious private voluntary relief effort. The Kurdish citizens of Erbil were the first to help, bringing food, water, tea, sugar and blankets to the Anfalakan, often at great personal risk. In time they were helped by relatives of the camp inmates--those who had survived Anfal because their place of residence was a town or a mujamma'a. The first volunteers were fired on as they tried to approach Baharka and Jezhnikan across the open scrub; laterthey were detained by soldiers, questioned and beaten. But in the end the authorities turned a blind eye to the relief operation, perhaps because they feared the spread of disease from the camps.29   By the end of the year, epidemics were rife. There were outbreaks of typhoid and hepatitis, as well as the more routine--but still deadly--scourges of influenza and dysentery. Despite the best efforts of the people of Erbil, many of the camp residents failed to make it through that first autumn and winter.30 The great majority of those who died were children, many of them from villages in Dohuk governorate that had been exposed to chemical weapons. Villagers from Tilakru, Warmilleh and Warakhal all reported burying many of their infants in Baharka, and one elderly woman from Gizeh, herself injured in a poison gas attack, lost three small grandchildren in Jezhnikan. They were Zana Muhammad Sharif (age two), Nahida (age two) and her brother Saman Abd-al-Rahman (age four).31   For the first few months the deportees lived in makeshift 'shades' of blankets or plastic sheeting on a crude framework of wooden stakes or poles. During this time the only solid structures were the guard towers, and the offices of Amn and Istikhbarat. Although the camp residents--having been victims of Anfal--were not able to obtain building loans from the state Real Estate Bank, after a year or so they had begun to build more substantial homes, thanks to the cheap sale or outright donation ofcinderblocks from a local factory. Gradually, the complexes began to take on the semi-permanent appearance of the dozens of others that the Iraqi regime had built during earlier waves of Kurdish resettlement. At first no one was allowed to leave the camps for more than an hour a day, and then only with a permit. But after three months or so these rules were relaxed, and the Ba'ath Party issued passes that allowed people to travel to Erbil to shop and, eventually, to work. Some of the able-bodied teenage boys and elderly men managed to find jobs as laborers on construction sites, although most families remained without any significant source of income.   Free now to move outside the camp, many of the women journeyed to Erbil to inquire after their missing husbands and brothers. The police and officials at the governorate gave them the runaround: 'We have no information...perhaps in a couple of days...don't worry, they are on their way.' The more persistent women were referred to the authorities in Dohuk, or Mosul, or Baghdad. But there was never any news, and none of their men were ever seen again.   By the summer of 1990, with government control of Iraqi Kurdistan fully restored, the inmates of Baharka-Jezhnikan were told that they were free to leave. There was no question of their being allowed to return to their home villages, which were now rubble. But many accepted the alternative of resettlement in one of the smaller complexes in Dohuk governorate--Hizawa, Gri Gowr, Telkabber and others--that were closer to their former homes in a Kurmanji-speaking area. Others stayed where they were, and two years after they arrived the government finally supplied the complex with water and electricity and opened primary and secondary schools. And there some 15,000 of the Badinan deportees remained until the spring of 1991, the Gulf War and the failed Kurdish uprising (raparin) that followed. As the uprising spread to the bleak camps on the Erbil plain, their inmates tore down the Amn post and the police station and took control of their own affairs for a few short days. But then the Republican Guard retook the complexes and drove the Anfalakan of Baharka-Jezhnikan into exile in Iran, leaving them homeless and destitute once more.   * * *     The Fate of the Christians and Yezidis     Barely two weeks after the arrival of the first deportees at Baharka--a number of testimonies suggest that the exact date was September 23 or 24, 1988--the official loudspeakers announced that a number of the camp's inmates should present themselves at the police station without delay. Those who were singled out in this way were either Assyrian and Chaldean Christians or members of the Yezidi sect of ethnic Kurds. What happened to these two groups remains one of the great unexplained mysteries of Anfal: a brutal sideshow, as it were, to the Kurdish genocide.   Despite Kurdish demands for autonomy, Iraqi Kurdistan is far from ethnically homogenous. Although its minority populations have declined sharply in number in the course of the 20th century, as the result of massacre, flight and religious conversion, the region is still home to three important groups. In addition to the Yezidis and the Assyrians (and their Catholic subgroup, the Chaldeans), there is an important Turkoman concentration in the mixed city of Kirkuk and several neighboring towns. With the exception of male deserters and draft dodgers, the Turkomans have long lived in government-controlled areas and have sometimes had tense relations with the Kurds. The Assyrians and the Yezidis are quite different cases, and despite violent conflicts with the Kurds earlier this century, the two groups have made common cause with them since the 1960s, sharing a common legacy of oppression by the regime in Baghdad.   The Assyrians, who number more than a million, are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. Most of them now live in the cities--Mosul, Dohuk and Erbil all have large Christian populations, as does the resort town of Shaqlawa. By the time of Anfal their once large rural presence had dwindled to a handful of villages in the mountains of Badinan. These were attractive places, with pretty churches, neatly laid out gardens and orchards, and sophisticated irrigation systems. Those Christians who live in Iraqi Kurdistan speak Kurmanji as well as their own Aramaic dialects. Although they are not ethnic Kurds, they also wear Kurdish clothes. Yet the regime officially classified them as Arabs in the 1977 census, a designation that many Assyrians and Chaldeans indignantly reject. 'Saddam Hussein calls us Arabs unfairly,' one Chaldean Christian told Middle East Watch, pointingindignantly to the headscarf that he wore as any Muslim Kurd would.32 Having taken an active part in the Kurdish movement for years, they are sometimes referred to in everyday parlance as 'Christian Kurds.'33   The Yezidis are a quite different matter. Kurmanji-speaking ethnic Kurds, they belong to a syncretist sect that worships the Peacock Angel (Malak Tawus), and are sometimes incorrectly spoken of as 'devil worshippers.'34 In northern Iraq, the Yezidis are mainly concentrated in the hilly plains that stretch from the southern edge of the Badinan mountains as far as the Tigris river, to the north of the city of Mosul--areas that are also home to a number of Assyrian Christians.   This pattern of settlement had left the Yezidis and Christians prey to a number of earlier campaigns of village destruction by the Iraqi regime, and it left them prey to Anfal too. Several thousand Yezidis were displaced from their homes in Jabal Sinjar, west of Mosul, in early 1973. Along with their Muslim Kurdish neighbors, many Yezidis and Christians in the Sleivani and Sheikhan areas were removed from their villages during the Arabization campaign of the mid-1970s. The border clearances of 1977 destroyed a dozen Christian churches in Badinan, some of them more than a thousand years old.35 Yet more Yezidis were removed from their homes and resettled in complexes to make way for the construction of the gigantic Saddam Dam on the Tigris in 1985. It is apparent that Ali Hassan al-Majid had nothing but contempt for the Yezidis. 'We must Arabize your area,' he snaps at an unnamed official from Mosul in one taperecorded meeting during the Anfal campaign. 'And only real Arabs--not Yezidis who one day say that they are Kurds and the next that they are Arabs. We turned a blind eye to the Yezidi people joining the jahsh in the beginning, in order to stop the saboteurs from growing. But apart from that, what use are the Yezidis? No use.'36   Al-Majid seems to have little more regard for the Assyrians, and the 'first stage' of his 1987 program of village clearances leveled a number of Christian villages in the north. The death of the village of Bakhtoma that April was vividly described to Middle East Watch by an Assyrian priest in Dohuk:   I had been told that they would destroy Bakhtoma because they had already destroyed most of the surrounding villages. It was around noon when I went to the church of St. George to remove the furniture, but Iraqi Army tanks and bulldozers were already beginning to roll into the village. I was the last one to pray in the church. After finishing my prayers, I removed the furniture to take it with me to Dohuk. It was a very sad day. The Iraqi soldiers and army engineers put the equivalent of one kilo of TNT at each corner of the church. After five minutes they blew up the building, and then went on to demolish every house in the village. Later they paid me compensation of 3,000 dinars. I went to the head of the Ba'ath Party in Dohuk, to ask why they were destroying our villages. He replied, 'You are Arabs and we decide what you should do. That is all there is to it.' I left his office then; what could I say?37   * * *     In Anfal there was not even the hope of compensation, and Assyrian villages like Kani Balaf (in the nahya of Berwari Bala), Mezeh (Sarseng) and Gund Kosa (Al-Doski) were burned and bulldozed along with those of their Muslim Kurdish neighbors. Some of the people from these villages took to the mountains together with the fleeing Kurds. Hundreds more sought refuge in Turkey. All of them waited where they were until they heard news of the September 6 amnesty, at which point they surrendered. A few days after the amnesty a large contingent of Christian and Yezidi refugees crossed the Khabour river in Turkish buses and gave themselves up to the Iraqi Army at the border post of Ibrahim Khalil. The Istikhbarat officers monitoring the repatriation asked the Yezidis and Christians to identify themselves and then ordered them to form a separate line off to one side. They said only that the men were to be returned to their army units if they were deserters, and that the women and children would be sent back to their homes. The Muslim Kurds who were present were given a piece of paper, marked 'To be sent to Erbil'; the Assyrians and Yezidis left empty-handed. The Kurds were at a loss to explain this, but assumed that their neighbors were being shown some special favor.38   After surrendering under the amnesty, the Christians and Yezidis were sent to Dohuk, like everyone else. The majority of the group were Yezidis, according to a witness who saw them there, and they occupied six rooms on the second floor of the fort, segregated from the Muslim Kurdish prisoners. Word of the new arrivals spread rapidly, and relatives who heard the news rushed to Dohuk in an attempt to visit them. Isho, an elderly Chaldean Catholic from the village of Mezeh, came to inquire after his four sons. None of them was a peshmerga, although three were deserters and the other a draft dodger. But it was a fruitless visit; Isho learned that all the Christian and Yezidi men had been taken away the day before in nine sealed vehicles. It was the last time they were seen alive. The women and children and the elderly, meanwhile, after a single night in Dohuk, were bussed to the barren camps of Baharka and Jezhnikan.   And there, after two weeks or so, came the curious call that the Christians and Yezidis should all report to the police station or the camp'sBa'ath Party office. Istikhbarat officers drove through the complexes in a Toyota Landcruiser to broadcast the announcement. The agents were thorough: later, they went around the camps to deliver the message individually to each family in turn, as they huddled beneath their temporary 'shades.' But there seemed nothing to fear, especially when an Assyrian priest repeated the request. 'You are going to be taken back to the places where we took you from,' one Istikhbarat agent said. 'We are going to take you to your men,' said another--a choice of phrasing that may have euphemistically conveyed the brutal truth.   At the police station, names were read out and checked off against a master list. One witness recalled that Istikhbarat then ordered the prisoners to divide themselves up into three groups: Christians; Yezidis who had surrendered in Dohuk governorate; and Yezidis who had turned themselves in to the army at Aqra, in the neighboring governorate of Nineveh. This last distinction made some people suspicious, and several of them lied about their place of capture, lining up with those who had surrendered in Aqra.39   Other residents of the camp said they watched enviously as the Yezidi prisoners waited by the main gate for the minibuses that they believed would take them to their homes in the Sheikhan area. A few days later, a single khaki-colored military bus arrived, accompanied by an army officer and nine or ten soldiers, to pick up twenty-six people from the Assyrian Christian village of Gund Kosa. Now only a handful of Christians remained, along with the Yezidis who had surrendered in Aqra--and these people stayed in Baharka-Jezhnikan until the summer of 1990, when the restrictions on movement were lifted. None of those who were bussed away from the camps ever reached their homes, and none was ever seen in the complexes, like Mansuriya (Masirik) and Khaneq,that were set aside for relocated Christians and Yezidis. The inescapable conclusion is that all of them were murdered. An Assyrian priest interviewed by Middle East Watch said that he had assembled a list of some 250 Christians disappeared during Anfal and its immediate aftermath.40   Isho, the elderly Chaldean man from Mezeh village, embarked on a long and anguished search for his four missing sons. He wrote a petition to President Saddam Hussein, but received no reply. He begged Amn and Istikhbarat agents at the Baharka camp to tell him what could have happened to his sons. They answered that the four would not have been covered by the September 6 amnesty, since it only applied to ethnic Kurds (although evidently not to Yezidis). 'If we had known that,' the old man replied bitterly, 'we would never have surrendered.' At some risk to his own life, he even visited the fort at Dohuk, only to be told that the Christian and Yezidi men had already been taken away to an unknown destination.   Although the old man's petititon to the president went unanswered, it did trigger--unknown to him--an internal inquiry by military intelligence. The results of that Istikhbarat investigation came to light during Middle East Watch's analysis of the captured Iraqi documents. Detailed below at pp.340-342, they shed important light on the chain of command of the Anfal operation. But they do not explain why the Christians and Yezidis should have been disappeared en masse, even after an amnesty was in force.   One plausible explanation is this: These obstinate minorities had refused to be part of the 'national ranks' as defined by the Iraqi authorities. To aggravate their crime, they also refused to accept the regime's designation of their ethnicity. Not only did they want to be treated like Kurds, they also acted like bad Arabs. Accordingly, they were to be considered traitors on two counts, and punished accordingly.   1 Iraqi News Agency, as reported in Al-Thawra, September 7, 1988. Other, broader amnesties were also decreed in the immediate post-Anfal period. On November 30, 1988, Revolutionary Command Council decree no. 860 announced 'a comprehensive and general amnesty' for all 'persons who have engaged in dissident political activities and subsequently gone into hiding.' On February 28, 1989, RCC decree no. 130 declared a general amnesty for all Iraqis who have fled the country, although again 'with the exception of the traitor Jalal al-Talabani and agents of the Iranian regime.' Al-Majid's comments on the amnesty are from an audiotaped meeting held on April 15, 1989.   2 At its noon briefing on September 8, after Shultz had met with Iraqi Minister of State Saadoun Hammadi, the State Department described Iraq's use of chemical weapons against the Kurds as 'unjustifiable and abhorrent' and 'unacceptable to the civilized world.' See Middle East Watch, Human Rights in Iraq (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 108-110.   3 Al-Thawra, September 7, 1988.   4 Two versions of the document spelling out al-Majid's powers over refugee resettlement have come to light. One, apparently the original order, is an unclassified letter to various departments from the Presidential Office of the Iraqi Republic, no. Q/1509 of September 7, 1988. The other, dated September 12, is 'secret and confidential' letter no. Sh 3/13631, from Amn Erbil to all Security Directorates in the governorate.   5 Letter no. Q/1509, dated September 7, 1988, from the Presidential Office of the Iraqi Republic to '[illegible] Deputy Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Respected Defense Minister, Respected Interior Minister and Ali Hassan al-Majid, Respected Secretary General of the Northern Bureau.'   6 Middle East Watch has examined many files of these sworn statements, duly filled in by returnees and dated at various times in September and October 1988. The documents also bear the signatures of representatives of the civil administration, the police, security and intelligence agencies and the local Ba'ath Party branch.   7 This procedure is spelled out in two documents, both issued by the local office of Amn in Shaqlawa. One is a letter to the Ba'ath Party's Returnee Reception Committee, dated October 7, 1988; the other is a letter (#5823) to all police stations, dated October 11, 1988.   8 The reader might imagine that this would hardly constitute punishment for a Kurd. However, entry into the military, the jahsh or the security forces had always been seen as an option that offered economic benefits as well as immunity from the regime's anti-Kurdish activities. The prohibition was therefore a blow to Kurdish aspirations as well as a further erosion of the civil rights of the Iraqi Kurdish minority. These modifications to the amnesty were set forth in Revolutionary Command Council decrees nos. 737 (September 8, 1988) and 785 (September 29, 1988).   9 Letter no.14951, dated November 23, 1988 and classified 'Secret and Confidential' from the Secretariat of Amn for the Autonomous Region to Amn Suleimaniyeh, citing instructions of the Northern Bureau Command.   10 The organization in question here is the Political Command of the Iraqi Kurdistan Front (Al-Qiyadeh al-Siyasiyeh lil-Jabha al-Kurdistaniyeh al-Iraqiyeh), a seven-party body (later eight) dominated by the PUK and the KDP.   11 'Reactions to the General Amnesty for the Kurds.'

Of these, seventy-one were judged to be of sub-adult age. For a full discussion of the team's methodology, see The Destruction of Koreme, pp.65-70, 92-95.   31 Several survivors said that twenty children from Tilakru died in the camps, as well as thirty from Warmilleh and between thirty-three and forty from Warakhal. In the first two cases, the effects of exposure to chemical weapons may well have been a contributing factor. The MEW-PHR forensic team exhumed the remains of three infant girls in the Baharka-Jezhnikan cemetery; each showed signs of severe malnutrition and/or disease stress. See The Destruction of Koreme, p.68.   32 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, July 7, 1992.   33 The Iraqi Christians had their own peshmerga organization, the Assyrian Democratic Movement--a full member of the Kurdistan Front. According to one PUK commander interviewed by Middle East Watch, the ADM had some 100-150 men under arms. Christians also had five seats reserved for them in the 105-seat Kurdish parliament elected in 1992.   34 The Peacock Angel is a divinity who may be associated with the Christian Satan, although he shares none of Satan's evil attributes.

Middle East Watch interviews, Dohuk, September 3 and 5, 1992.   39 The lie was a judicious one, for the separation of the Yezidis suggests that the regime's intent was to disappear only those who had been captured within the theater of operations covered by Anfal, which ended at the edge of Nineveh governorate. This same logic--which reflects bureaucratic rigidity rather than clemency--is evident in Iraqi government documents dealing with the treatment of captured civilians. For example, a secret letter from Amn headquarters in the governorate of Erbil, no. Sh 2/12809, dated August 26, 1988, says that two named individuals detained in the Anfal theater have been 'returned by the Northern Bureau Command, due to the fact that they are not residents of areas that were included in the Anfal operations.' (emphasis added)   40 Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 10, 1992. In the course of a dozen interviews with Christians, Yezidis and other survivors of Baharka-Jezhnikan, Middle East Watch assembled a total of ninety-eight names of people who had disappeared. This list consisted of sixty-four Christians (twenty-five men, eighteen women, twelve children under the age of sixteen, and nine of unknown age and sex), and thirty-four Yezidis (four men, nine women and twenty-one children). Several of those who disappeared were infants of less than one year; the oldest was a woman of eighty-five.     12   Aftermath   'With God's help, we have managed to eliminate from our beloved North the saboteur factions and collaborators with the enemy. The situation in the Northern Region now calls for certain measures commensurate with this new phase.'   -- Communique from Ali Hassan al-Majid's Northern Bureau, November 1988.   As the experience of the Yezidis and Christians suggested, the general amnesty of September 6 was not the end of the Anfal story. As we shall see, there were continued mass executions of prisoners captured before the amnesty. The Ba'ath Party's Returnee Reception Committee (Lajnet Istiqbal al-A'idin) continued to function until at least February 1989, relocating the families of 'saboteurs' to complexes on the Erbil plain.1 In addition to the sworn residence statements mentioned earlier, 'returnees to the national ranks' were also to undertake: (a) to live in housing assigned to them and not to change their address; (b) not to take part in any 'saboteur' activity; and (c) to 'stand for their country'--on pain of punishment as stipulated by the law.2   The new mujamma'a of Ber Hoshter, to the north of the city of Erbil, was opened for returnees on November 27, 1988,3 and the resettlement of the families of suspected peshmerga in nearby Girdachal went on for at least another six or seven months after that.4 The regime appears to have set up a special Pursuit (or 'Follow-Up') Committee (Lajnet al-Mutaba'a) to enforce the terms of the returnee program, and a flurry of orders from Amn and other agencies exhorted the security forces to greater vigilance of the complexes. Amn also issued arrest warrants for anyone who left the mujamma'at without permission or otherwise infringed the terms of their resettlement. In at least one case, the Erbil governorate's Committee to Fight Hostile Activity (Lajnet Mukafahat al-Nashat al-Mu'adi) also appears to have revived a pattern more characteristic of the 1970s, relocating individual Kurdish families in the south of Iraq.5   By the end of the year, the note of urgency in government documents had somewhat diminished, to be replaced by a tone of wary confidence. 'With God's help,' began an order from Ali Hassan al-Majid'sNorthern Bureau, 'we have managed to eliminate from our beloved North the saboteur factions and collaborators with the enemy.'   The situation in the Northern Region now calls for certain measures commensurate with this new phase, taking precautions against any new method to which the remaining saboteurs may turn--those who will try to create pockets of sabotage from which to carry out acts that will inspire their sympathizers, and give the impression to their masters abroad that they still possess footholds in our nation's soil and are capable of undertaking acts of sabotage. There is no doubt that, from now on, we will not find a group of saboteurs that is large in size, or that operates out of fixed bases, or that launches large-scale operations. Instead what we may find are small mobile groups of saboteur elements numbering no more than ten or fifteen. These groups would then wait to gauge the level of our response to their acts. If the reaction is normal and routine, then they will redouble their activities, broaden their base and undertake larger operations in graduated phases. They would also organize their internal structures in such a way as to keep in touch with some of their friendly elements who may have benefited from the amnesty decree.6   Al-Majid clearly felt that he faced a delicate dilemma. On the one hand, he could not afford to appear lax, in case this emboldened the peshmerga. To prevent this, he ordered draconian measures by the security apparatus. 'Force and just harshness' must be used in the struggle. 'There shall be a prompt and decisive response to any incidents that may occur, with the scale of the response being out of proportion to the scale of the incident, no matter how trivial the latter may be.'   On the other hand, as far as the economic life of Iraqi Kurdistan was concerned, 'what is called for is a departure from emergency measures, because the continuation of the economic siege gives the impression that we are still nervous about the situation.' The blockade of the north would be relaxed slightly, the document concluded, although there would still be restrictions on the sale of gasoline, a blockade on the sale of certain foodstuffs and a continued ban on any sale of food outside the complexes. Any mujamma'a found to be involved in smuggling food to 'the seats of sabotage' would immediately have its food rations terminated.7   Now that the rural population had been removed, there would also be a new census, or 'sub-census,' to determine and count the numbers of those who were not registered in the 1987 census in the Autonomous Region.8 By the following spring planting season, the regime was even prepared to countenance the resumption of some modest farming activities in the Kurdish countryside. On April 9, 1989, the Northern Bureau Command issued order no.3335, which modified the ban on farming in the prohibited areas. At least in principle, these lands could now be worked once more by their owners (although not by amnestied returnees), or leased for agricultural use if they were the property of the state.   In practice, however, little changed. There would be no rebuilding of what had been destroyed. 'The prohibited areas have been demarcated, and agriculture may not be pursued there,' Amn reminded its branches. 'Nor shall there be [any] human presence in them, due to their effect in the military and security sphere and their location in the Third Phase [of village clearances].'9 Clause 5 of Northern BureauCommand directive SF/4008, ordering the summary killing of anyone found in the prohibited areas, remained in force.10 Having eradicated much of its Kurdistan bread basket, Iraq would be more reliant then ever on food imports and generous agricultural credit from abroad, notably the U.S. and Australia.11   Farmers would only be allowed to work their lands if they agreed to act as informers for Amn about any suspicious activities in their area. Indeed, in February 1990, Amn proposed to tighten these restrictions even further. Agriculture should only be permitted, the security agency suggested to the Fifth Army Corps, if the farmer in question was fully trusted by the authorities, and pledged in addition not to build any fixed structure and to refrain from working at night.   * * *     Continued Village Clearances     By now, only a few hundred villages remained intact in the three governorates that make up the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. According to a survey prepared by the Ministry of Reconstruction and Development of the new Kurdish government, 673 villages were still standing in the three governorates of Erbil, Suleimaniyeh and Dohuk;4049 had been destroyed. Of those that remained, some two-thirds were concentrated in the environs of Erbil city, Makhmour and Aqra--areas that had been excluded altogether from Anfal.12   Yet there was no guarantee of lasting security for the minority of villages that had survived the Anfal campaign. On April 15, 1989, order No.3448 of the Northern Bureau authorized the 'evacuation and rounding up' of an unspecified number of villages belonging to the Bradost and Dolamari tribes, in order to make way for a new dam on the Greater Zab river at Bakhma, an idea which had been in the works since the 1950s. The Bradost and Dolamari had been loyal to the government, but their location, in an area where the territory once controlled by the PUK abutted the traditional strongholds of the KDP, now became a liability. The Bakhma impoundment, in addition to its economic advantages, would drive a permanent strategic wedge between these two rebellious regions.13   Just a few miles to the south of the Bradost and Dolamari settlements, another fourteen villages were demolished in a joint army-Amn sweep in December 1988 and their inhabitants deported to the nearby complex of Basirma. This time the stated pretext was not the Bakhma Dam project but continuing counterinsurgency operationsagainst any lingering pockets of peshmerga resistance.14 One of the villages affected was Serkand Khailani, a relatively large place of close to a thousand people. It had survived Anfal, but army troops now stormed it with artillery, helicopters and ground forces, as well as units of the Mafarez Khaseh.15 In the wake of the assault, Serkand Khailani was razed to the ground and most of the villagers arrested. Everyone was taken to Shaqlawa, where they spent the night confined to IFAs at the army base, and from there to Basirma--everyone, that is, except for five people, who were taken off by Amn in a separate jeep. They included the wife, brother and teenage daughter of the village headman, or ra'is.   The headman himself was picked up by Amn in a separate incident early in 1989. He was detained for seven months at Amn's Erbil headquarters and repeatedly tortured--beaten with a cable, suspended from a hook on the ceiling, soaked in water and given electric shocks to the earlobes. At frequent intervals, cellmates were taken out to be executed. Yet curiously, during the long sessions of interrogation that the ra'is endured, the five disappeared villagers of Serkand Khailani were mentioned only in passing. They were saboteurs, he was told, and he would never see them again. After seven months, without a word of explanation, the headman was released. At about the time he got back to the Basirma complex, he received two documents from the Census and Sanitary Department of the Ministry of Health in Erbil. They were death certificates for the two men who had disappeared. The date they bore was February 20, 1989; the cause of death was given as 'execution by firing of bullets.' No word was ever received about the fate of the threewomen, although documents describing their execution were reportedly found by the peshmerga during the 1991 uprising.16   * * *     Continued Mass Killings: Yunis's Story     Murder, in other words--including mass execution--continued to be a fundamental tool of the regime in its dealings with the Kurds, even though Anfal was now over and most of the countryside was uninhabited. Anyone found in a 'prohibited area' was likely to be killed, as was anyone suspected of peshmerga activity in the few villages that had been spared. Some of these killings were ordered by the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau, and Ali Hassan al-Majid appears to have kept a close personal eye on the elimination of prominent 'saboteurs.' (A handwritten note from September 1988, by the director of the Shaqlawa office of Amn, passes on al-Majid's compliments to the agents responsible for the liquidation of a Communist Party cadre and the burning of his body: 'Well done!' the Northern Bureau chief writes. 'May God bless them for their faith and loyalty.')   Other executions were decreed by Saddam Hussein himself; others by the Revolutionary Court (Mahkamat al-Thawra); and others still by special military tribunals.17 A large number of individual death certificates and other official documents bear witness to these executions. An August 1989 report from Amn Suleimaniyeh, for example, enumerates eighty-seven executions since January 1 of that year. Many were people picked up in 'prohibited' villages; one was a literature teacher executed for teaching his students the Kurdish language in Latin script.18   Most crucially, there continued to be mass executions of people who had been captured during the Anfal campaign but remained alive in custody at the time of the September 6 amnesty. Some were even killed after surrendering during the five-week amnesty grace period, their crime recorded in official documents as suspected membership in or collaboration with an illegal organization, such as the PUK, the KDP or the Islamic Party.19 Middle East Watch was also able to find two survivors of these post-amnesty mass killings.   Yunis was a 19-year old peshmerga who had fought with the PUK in the battle of Sergalou and later in the Balisan Valley during the Sixth Anfal. Cut off from his main peshmerga force near Akoyan by Iraqi troops, he hid out for a while with relatives in the town of Khalifan. But he was persuaded by rumors of an amnesty to surrender to Amn in the town of Sadiq around the middle of August.20 The local Amn office speedily transferred him to the agency's headquarters in Erbil, where he shared a large cell with about a hundred other prisoners--a mix ofpeshmerga, deserters and Anfalakan from the Koysinjaq area. Yunis was interrogated and tortured off and on for another three weeks.   One day at the beginning of September, Amn guards assembled the prisoners, stripped them of their possessions and loaded them into a single large civilian bus. It was so crowded that the men had to sit on each other's laps. Their destination was the Popular Army camp on the outskirts of Dibs, which they reached at about 7:00 that evening. The prisoners received two daily rations of stale bread and water. Each day there were further rounds of questioning by plainclothes agents--also Amn men, Yunis guessed. Then, on September 6, guards told them that there had been a general amnesty and that they would be released.   But nothing changed. The daily interrogation sessions continued, together with brutal forms of torture. Beatings with a length of electrical cable were an everyday routine. The interrogators also devised two other standard torments. One was to fill a plastic bag with water and ice cubes, suspend it from the ceiling, pierce it with a pin, and allow the freezing liquid to drip on to the forehead of the prisoner, who was lashed to a bedframe beneath. This went on for up to twenty minutes each time; after ten, the pain was acute, and the prisoner would thrash around on the bed in a vain attempt to evade the icy drip. The ice-water treatment alternated with the application of extreme heat. The interrogators would slide a hot electric stove under the prisoner's bed for four or five minutes at a stretch, causing painful burns to the lower back.   These torments were the worst that Yunis personally had to endure. But one day, just before the amnesty was announced, he and the other prisoners from Erbil watched through the windows of their cell as three men accused of being 'internal peshmerga'--that is to say, active in the cities--were brought into the courtyard below. The men were blindfolded, made to stand on chairs and tied to posts in the yard, arms raised above their heads. The chairs were then kicked away, leaving the prisoners' feet dangling a couple of feet from the ground. Next, guards attached one end of a string to an empty Butagaz container and the other to each prisoner's scrotum. When the signal was given, the guard would drop the gas cylinder, ripping out the man's testicles. Within half an hour, all three were dead.   A few days later the guards entered Yunis's cell, carried out a head count of the prisoners and told them that they were to be transferred. By now their numbers had swelled to about 180, including new arrivals--as before, a motley assortment of peshmerga, deserters andordinary civilians. Each man was blindfolded and stripped of his IDs and had his hands tied behind his back. The prisoners were then loaded into six windowless vehicles, with benches in the rear and a separate driver's compartment--of the same sort, in other words, as those described by survivors of the earlier mass executions near Ramadi. They left Dibs at about 7:30 p.m. just before sunset. It was the evening of September 14, according to Yunis, and the general amnesty had been in force for eight days.   The buses turned left out of the camp gate, drove along a paved surface for a few minutes and then turned right on to a dirt road. As the bus bumped along this track, Yunis managed to work his hands free and loosen his blindfold. After an hour or so the convoy came to a halt, and the guards began to pull the prisoners out through the rear door. When it came to Yunis's turn, they saw that his hands were no longer tied. The guards pushed him to the ground and kicked him viciously. Over the top of his blindfold, Yunis could see a uniformed officer walk over and raise his hand. There was a sharp blow to the base of his skull with a heavy metal object, and Yunis felt himself falling forward. The last thing he knew before he lost consciousness was the touch of his fingers on another human face.   When he came to, he found that his lower body was covered with sand. He saw now that he was in a narrow trench--twenty yards long, one yard across and two deep--apparently dug by a backhoe. As he took stock of his surroundings, he heard the sound of a bulldozer approaching, and a fresh load of dirt was dumped into the trench next to him, throwing up a large cloud of dust. In the dust and darkness, Yunis scrambled free, away from the buses, the bulldozer and the voices of the guards. In the distance, to the east, he could see fires, which he guessed were the oilfields of Kirkuk.   He ran in the direction of Kirkuk until he reached a paved road. Hearing the sound of an engine, he jumped out to flag it down, but as the sound grew nearer he realized that it was an army IFA truck accompanied by a jeep, and he flung himself down by the roadside before the drivers could spot him in their headlights. Before long a civilian car stopped. The driver, a fellow Kurd, was wearing the uniform of the Popular Army, but Yunis was too exhausted to care, and to his relief theman drove him to Dibs without asking too many questions. From there, Yunis eventually rejoined his fellow peshmerga in Iran.21   * * *     Continued Mass Killings: Hussein's Story     'Hussein' presents a very different case. A year younger than Yunis, he was sympathetic to the peshmerga cause, as indeed most Kurds were, but was not politically active himself. At the time of Anfal, he and four companions had found work as carpenters in a number of towns and complexes around Erbil. On November 26, 1988, they were working on a house in the village of Shiwarash, which had escaped destruction during the 1987 campaign on the Erbil plain, when four or five pick-ups and Landcruisers pulled up, filled with members of 'security and the organization'--in other words, Amn and the Ba'ath Party. The five young men were bundled into the vehicles and driven first to Party headquarters in Khabat. As they approached their next destination, Hussein heard church bells ring. From this he concluded that they were in Einkawa, a Christian suburb of Erbil.22   Here they stayed for three days, handcuffed and blindfolded with their cummerbunds (pishtend). They were given no food or water and forbidden to leave their cell, even to urinate. An electric light burned day and night, while a team of interrogators, headed by a man whom his colleagues referred to as Amn Lieutenant Ghassan, tried to get the five to admit to their connection to the PUK. The Lieutenant played 'good cop'; when his gentler methods failed, he transferred the prisoners to harsher colleagues. Each denial of PUK links brought a fresh round of torture. Hussein endured the falaka, in which the prisoner is beaten on the soles of the feet while seated with his legs in the air; he was hung from the ceiling by a rope tied to his handcuffs; if he passed out, he was revived by being burned with a lighted cigarette.   After three days of this, Hussein and his companions were taken to Amn headquarters in Erbil, where Yunis had been held three monthsearlier. There, each man was placed in an isolation cell that measured less than ten square feet.23 Hussein counted the passage of nine days, the first seven filled with interrogation and torture. Again, there was the falaka; again, suspension from the ceiling. But there were new tortures as well--the application of burning irons to his legs and neck; electric shocks to the tongue and penis. The interrogators told him that if he confessed to his PUK ties, he would be released; if he denied them, he would be executed. He told them that he knew nothing.   On the seventh day, Hussein was forced to put his thumbprint to a piece of paper. He was still blindfolded, and the contents of the document were not read out to him. With this, the questioning and the torture ceased, and two days later a guard opened the door of Hussein's cell to tell him that Saddam Hussein had decreed another general amnesty.24 All the prisoners were to be freed. Hussein and his four friends were again placed in a common cell, handcuffed once more, and taken to a waiting vehicle. As they drove--between an hour and two hours on a paved road, then another half-hour on dirt--they could hear the guards discussing their fate. 'Where are we taking them?' asked the first. 'To the south,' answered another. And then a third voice joined in: 'They cannot live in the south.' At that, the five men knew what was going to happen to them.   When they stopped, it was twilight and cold. 'Sit down and don't move,' the guards told the prisoners. 'We are going to take your photographs.' They sat crosslegged in a line, and almost at once the guards opened fire with automatic weapons. The first volley of shots missed Hussein and he instinctively threw his head into his lap for protection. As he did so, a bullet from a second round of firing struck him in the right shoulder, passing right through the flesh. The impactknocked him forward into a deep ditch, and he could hear the bodies of the other four men tumbling in beside him. There was another burst of gunfire. When it was over, the executioners shovelled earth roughly on top of their five victims and went on their way.   Hussein, semi-conscious, pushed aside the dirt, which had not fully covered him. He lay where he was for two hours as darkness fell. The grave, he saw now, was an abandoned and derelict well, its walls eroded by rainfall. He touched his friends to see if they were alive, but there was no response. Clawing his way upward over their bodies, he managed to pull himself out of the pit, leaving only his Adidas track shoes behind. It was cold and raining, and in the distance he could see two separate clusters of city lights. Closer at hand, perhaps two miles away, he saw the glow of a fire and struck out in that direction. Shoeless, and with his feet bruised and swollen from the falaka torture, it took Hussein all night to reach the house.   He guessed--wrongly, as it turned out--that he was somewhere near Kirkuk, and called out in Arabic, 'Family of the house!' (ahl al-beit). A man's voice answered, 'Come on in!' (tfaddal). He knocked, and a woman opened the door. Seeing a young man barefoot and covered in blood, she started back in fear and beat her breast in pity. But the couple brought him a meal of water and tea and sheep's fat (samneh), and he told them the outlines of his story. As he talked, the woman fetched Arab clothing and a heavy Popular Army greatcoat to conceal the bloodstains from the wound in Hussein's shoulder. And at daybreak the man took him to the door to show him where he was. The nearby highway, where Hussein could see electricity pylons and passing trucks, led in one direction to Mosul and in the other to Al-Qayyara. The man explained that the lights that Hussein had seen in the night belonged to the Arab towns of Tharthar and al-Hadhar.25   Eventually, like Yunis, Hussein escaped to Iran. Some time later, Amn presented his mother with the young man's death certificate.26   * * *     The End of the 'Exceptional Situation'     When did Anfal reach its conclusion? The question can be answered in a number of different ways. In a strict military sense, it ended with the victory over the KDP in Badinan and the announcement of the September 6 amnesty. From the point of view of the Iraqi public, it may be said to have ended on October 1, when ritual celebrations of the victory were organized by the ruling Ba'athist Party.27 As far as the logic of Anfal as a campaign of extermination is concerned, it certainly went on for several more months, at least until well into 1988.   Some might even argue that Anfal lasted until June 1989, for it was then that Iraqi troops destroyed Qala Dizeh, a large town of some 70,000 people to the east of Dukan Lake. Qala Dizeh is an ancient settlement and a celebrated name in Kurdish history, for it was the target of a notorious bombing raid by the Iraqi Air Force on April 24, 1974, which left hundreds dead.28 As a city, Qala Dizeh itself was exempt from the narrow logic of Anfal, but certainly not from reprisals or punitive action. Although parts of the city center had been demolishedin 1987, Ba'ath Party officials repeatedly assured the residents that they had nothing further to fear. The area around Qala Dizeh, which included the nearby town of Sengaser and the complexes of Pemalek, Tuwasuran and Jarawa--built for evacuees from the border clearances of the late 1970s--was also spared by Anfal. Although some villages were destroyed here in mid-1988, their population had not been 'Anfalized.'   Sandwiched between the depopulated Iranian border area and Dukan Lake, and in relatively flat terrain, the Qala Dizeh area had not harbored any significant peshmerga threat during Anfal, and the regime had been content to leave it alone. But by the spring of 1989, it had become a glaring anomaly, the only sizeable population center that remained so close to the Iranian border. Worse, the mountains to the east had become the principal regrouping point for the PUK as it struggled to reassert a presence inside Iraq, and on March 22, 1989, the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee ordered 'maximum measures' against the area east of Dukan lake.29   In late May, troops surrounded Qala Dizeh with tanks and heavy artillery and gave the townspeople a month to leave. They were to be moved 'in the public interest,' to 'modern villages.'30 A number of choices were offered: trucks would take them either to Bazian, on the road to Suleimaniyeh, or to three new complexes on the Erbil plain--Khabat, Kawar Gosek and Daratou. It took the army engineers three weeks, beginning June 1, to demolish Qala Dizeh, and they left nothing standing, not even the new electrical power substation and the water-pumping station that the regime itself had built in 1987. On June 24, 1989, Qala Dizeh was officially declared a 'prohibited area.'   Yet Qala Dizeh may best be seen, perhaps, as a postscript to Anfal--a return to the same logic of anti-Kurdish activities that had gone on for years. The best answer to our question may be that the logic ofAnfal ended when the behavior of the Iraqi bureaucracy shifted into a perceptibly different gear. This is not the same as saying 'when the killing stopped,' or 'when the deportations ended,' or 'when the last village had been burned and bulldozed.' For killings and deportations and scorched earth policies have been a feature of life under the Ba'ath Party for many years, and they continue to this day. But, by the spring of 1989, it is safe to say that the Iraqi regime felt that all the goals of Anfal had been met, and on April 23, the Revolutionary Command Council issued its decree No.271, in which the special powers conferred upon Ali Hassan al-Majid were revoked.31 The sense that the Kurdish problem was now fully under control is further reinforced by Saddam Hussein's December 1989 decision to abolish even the Northern Affairs Committee of the RCC, which had been in existence for more than ten years.32   With his task in Kurdistan complete, other duties now awaited Ali Hassan al-Majid's singular talents--notably, after the August 1990 invasion, as Governor of occupied Kuwait.   'I would like to admit,' he told Ba'ath officials gathered to welcome Hassan Ali al-Amiri, his successor as General Secretary of the Northern Bureau, 'that I am not the right person for the current stable situation.... I hope that the comrades in the North will not ask Comrade Hassan Ali to do things that he cannot do. Because that stage is over. It will no longer be allowed for a member of the Party to have power over the army, because the exceptional situation has come to an end. These powers are not being withdrawn from Comrade Hassan Ali because he is not capable of the task, but because that stage has finished.'33   Al-Majid was evidently well-pleased with his efforts--not, he added, that the humanity of his motives should be doubted. 'I cry when I see a tragic show or movie,' he told his audience that day. 'One day I cried when I saw a woman in a movie who was lost and without a family. But I would like to tell you that I did what I did and what I was supposed to do. I don't think you could do more than what I could do.'   During another meeting with Party officials, al-Majid is heard to remark that, 'What we have managed to do is something which the Party and the leadership never achieved until 1987. Some of it was just the result of help and mercy from God. Nothing else.' An unnamed party member chimes in to offer praise. 'Only God can do more than you did. Otherwise you can do anything. This Ba'ath Party can do anything.'34   ______   1 The minutes of the Ba'ath Party's Returnee Reception Committee meeting on February 1, 1989 refers to the relocation of a saboteur's family in the Ber Hoshter complex. The minutes of another meeting of the committee, dated September 13, 1988--a week after the declaration of the general amnesty--resolve that 'people who used to live in areas controlled by the saboteurs are to be treated as saboteurs,' and notes that returnees are to be transferred to the complexes by the Iraqi Police and the [Erbil governorate's] Committee to Fight Hostile Activity.   2 A number of sworn statements to this effect, bearing various dates in late 1988, were found among files recovered from Ba'ath Party offices in Erbil.   3 According to an undated Ba'ath Party letter found in Iraqi government files in Erbil.   4 This was reported to us by a family from the village of Gelnaski, one of the principal KDP headquarters in Badinan, whose son was reportedly executed after surrendering under the amnesty. Middle East Watch was shown a grave at Dohuk that supposedly contained the young man's body. It lay in an unmarked area outside the Dohuk municipal cemetery that appeared to contain approximately forty-five other graves. Middle East Watch interview, Dohuk, June 4, 1992.   5 A series of instructions from the local Committee to Fight Hostile Activity in Shaqlawa indicates that five families from the Harir area, totalling thirty-seven people, were deported to the marshy southern governorate of Thiqar (formerly Nasiriya) on January 2, 1989, in vehicles supplied by the Traffic Directorate (Mudiriyat al-Murour) of the Erbil governorate. These people were accompanied by a regular Iraqi Police officer, indicating that there was nothing secretive about the transfer.   An Amn Shaqlawa memorandum, dated May 16, 1989, also notes that the former residents of the destroyed village of Khirkhawa, who now live in complexes, will be deported to the south if the 'saboteurs' attempt to make contact with them.   6 These are extracts from the decisions taken at a meeting held on November 8, 1988, and relayed to Amn chiefs in the Autonomous Region by a set of instructions from the region's Security Director, no.14951, dated November 21, 1988 and classified 'Secret and Confidential.'   7 ibid.   8 Plans for the sub-census are outlined in a communique from the Office of the Presidency, no. K/2/1/45508, dated December 2, 1988. These in turn are conveyed to the Ministry of Planning in letter no. 548 from the Northern Affairs Committee of the RCC, dated January 25, 1989.   9 The 'Third Phase,' in other words, clearly refers to the period since June 22, 1987 and continuing after the Anfal operation. This order is conveyed in letter no.6271 from Amn Erbil to Amn Shaqlawa, dated April 26, 1989 and apparently classified.   10 This was true until at least July 1989, several months after the derogation of al-Majid's exceptional powers. Erbil Committee to Fight Hostile Activity, 'confidential' letter no. 3489 to Fifth Army Corps, dated July 5, 1989. The only exceptions to the rule were Amn informers and members of the Mafarez Khaseh, whose presence in the prohibited areas had to be coordinated in advance with the military. The exceptions are spelled out in an Erbil governorate Amn letter to the internal security section of Fifth Army Corps Command, no. Sh 3/1524, dated February 13, 1990.   11 Between 1983 and 1988, Iraq acquired more than $2.8 billion in U.S. agricultural products under the Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) credit-guarantee program. In 1989, the Bush administration doubled the CCC program for Iraq, raising credits to a level exceeding one billion dollars in 1989. In addition to credit guarantees, the CCC program included interest-free loans and direct sales at prices subsidized by the U.S. government. See Middle East Watch, Human Rights in Iraq, New York, 1990, p.152.   12 Resool's figures (op. cit.) closely parallel those of the Ministry. He cites a cumulative total of 3,839 villages destroyed since 1975. The villages that were spared include a hundred or so belonging to the loyalist Surchi tribe in the qadha of Aqra. On January 28, 1988, on the eve of Anfal, the Shaqlawa Security Committee 'pointed out that it will not object to the lifting of the security prohibition regarding these villages, due to the fact that their population belongs to the Surchi tribe and that most of them are volunteer members of the National Defense Battalions. Furthermore, these villages have been beyond the reach of the saboteurs, their inhabitants have not collaborated with them, and no confrontations have occurred in the region.' Amn Erbil to Amn Shaqlawa, letter no. S T/17922 of November 21, 1988.   13 The Bakhma dam project was conceived originally as a small-scale irrigation and electricity-generating project. However, after the Ba'ath came to power in 1968 it grew more ambitious. Scheduled for completion in 1994, the dam remained only partially built by the time of the Kurdish uprising in March 1991, when its machinery was extensively looted and damaged. Middle East Watch interview with a former administrator in the Erbil headquarters of the Jahafel al-Difa' al-Watani (or jahsh), Erbil, July 7, 1992.   14 These fourteen villages lay between the town of Khalifan and the Greater Zab river. Their names are listed in an Amn Erbil report, dated December 11, 1988, as Faqian, Kulken Kolo, Madgerdan, Mingerdan, Daljar, Qalata Sin, Pir Marwa, Deremer, Serkand, Suka, Serkoz, Kuska, and upper and lower Jimkei. Resool, op. cit., pp.65-67, lists nineteen villages in the nahyas of Salah al-Din and Harir destroyed during December 1988. Serkand Khailani is the only name that appears on both lists, and its story follows.   15 On the Mafarez Khaseh and other special jahsh units, see above p. 22-24.   16 Middle East Watch interview, Basirma complex, September 11, 1992. An internal Istikhbarat report on Serkand Khailani village, dated November 1, 1988, noted that a number of Kalashnikov rifles had been found in this man's home, concealed in a child's crib. Again, the match-up of documentary and testimonial evidence is striking.   17 Letter No.25163 from the Security Director of the Suleimaniyeh governorate, dated October 29, 1988, mentions executions ordered by the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau and by the Revolutionary Court. One former prisoner was brought before Military Court No.23 in Erbil, a body with the power to impose the death sentence. In this particular case, the court's powers were superseded by 'a special [execution] order from Baghdad.' The man eventually escaped, and was interviewed by Middle East Watch in Khaneq complex on August 27, 1992.   18 Secret and confidential letter no. 19727 from the director of Amn Suleimaniyeh to the director of Amn Autonomous Region headquarters, August 24, 1989.   19 Handwritten documents found in an Amn Erbil file.   20 Many Kurds in the Khalifan area surrendered prematurely as a result of these rumors. Another was a PUK peshmerga named Haydar Awla Ali Muhammad-Amin, whose arrest on September 15, 1988 is referred to in an Amn document of September 7, 1990. Haydar was persuaded to surrender to Amn by one Najma Grou, a leader of the Amn-controlled Kurdish Mafarez Khaseh. After this he disappeared. In response to his wife's persistent requests for news, Najma Grou told her, 'Go home: your husband is no more.' Middle East Watch interview, Galala complex, March 23, 1993.   In an earlier interview in Sadiq, July 18, 1992, Yunis told MEW that the only person he recognized in the group to be executed was a relative from Galala named 'Haydar Abdullah.' Since Awla is a shortened Kurdish form of the name Abdullah, this was almost certainly the same man.   21 ibid.   22 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, July 14, 1992.   23 Middle East Watch accompanied Hussein to the former Amn building in Erbil on July 14, 1992, where he identified the room in which he had been detained.   24 The Revolutionary Command Council did in fact issue an amnesty decree on December 14. Yet Hussein was convinced--and his chronology bears this out--that the date of his attempted execution was December 8. Amnesties, as noted elsewhere, are a regular feature of life under the Ba'athist regime, and yet another was decreed on February 29, 1989, this one for all those who had fled to Iran, with the exception of PUK leader Jalal Talabani.   25 And thus of particular interest, since the archaeological site of Al-Hadhar, south of Mosul, was mentioned several times as a mass execution site during Anfal. See above p.253. Hussein's story is based on a Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, July 14, 1992.   26 A third reported example of post-amnesty killings involves Omar and Rahman, the two brothers from the Sheikh Bzeini area whose flight during the Fourth Anfal is recounted above at pp.185-188, and who were captured by the army in mid-June, 1988. Another prisoner who was released under the September 6 amnesty saw them in jail at that time, still alive, but that is the last that was ever seen of them. Middle East Watch interview, Daratou complex, July 15, 1992.   27 Yusef Rahim Rashid, a lawyer with the Kurdish Human Rights Organization (KHRO) told Middle East Watch that he attended one such ceremony in Erbil.   28 The motive for the 1974 bombing was apparently the KDP's decision to reopen the University of Suleimaniyeh in Qala Dizeh. The university had been closed down by the regime that March.   29 RCC Northern Affairs Committee directive no. 1925 of March 22, 1989, signed by Abd-al-Rahman Aziz Hassan. These measures were to include the temporary deportation to the south of families who had contact with the 'saboteurs.' The directive also insists that the 'clear instructions' of Northern Bureau Command directive no. SF/4008 of June 20, 1987 should continue to be observed.   30 Middle East Watch interviews with former residents, Qala Dizeh, May 23, 1992.   31 The RCC decree is conveyed in a circular from Amn Erbil to all Section Security Directors, no. Sh 3/7604, classified 'secret and confidential' and dated May 17, 1989. The circular reads, 'By virtue of the Revolutionary Command Council's decree no. 271 of April 23, 1989, it has been decided to abrogate RCC decree no. 160 of March 24, 1987 granting special authority to the Comrade Secretary General of the Northern Bureau.'   32 RCC decree no. 771 of December 3, 1989, signed by Saddam Hussein, revoking RCC decree no. 997 of August 2, 1979.   33 Audiotape of a meeting between Ali Hassan al-Majid and unnamed officials, Kirkuk, April 15, 1989.   34 Audiotape of meeting between Ali Hassan al-Majid and unnamed officials, Kirkuk, May 26, 1988.  13   The Vanishing Trail 'These measures will have a deterrent effect because  (a) the prisoners will vanish without leaving a trace;  (b) no information may be given as to their whereabouts or their fate.'  -- Nacht und Nebel Erlass (Nazi Germany's Night and Fog Decree), modified version, February 1942.  'They have sunk into deep water. They were lost. We have no information about them.'  -- elderly female survivor from Goktapa.   Forced disappearance is the distinctive act of terror of the modern state. It immobilizes the survivor with doubt and fear, with unconsummated grief and mourning that is permitted none of the rituals of closure. The washing and clothing of the dead, the placing of the body with its face turned toward Mecca that is required of the devout Muslim--these acts were not possible for the disappeared of Anfal. In the case of those who were executed in captivity under the routine terror of the Ba'ath regime, a punctilious bureaucracy at least furnished the family with the legal proof of death. But for most of the Kurds who disappeared during Anfal, there was not even this.  Once the campaign was over, most of the survivors inhabited a netherworld of uncertainty. Women had lost their breadwinners, and Islamic law forbade them to remarry until seven years had passed since their husbands went missing. Although the stories of the firing squads were known and repeated, the Kurds' squalid resettlement complexes were still swept by rumors of Anfalakan kept alive in secret jails in the desert, held as bargaining chips in some future round of negotiations between the regime and the peshmerga, taken off to other countries--Sudan, Yemen or Jordan--to be used as slave labor.  Before the uprising of March 1991, while the Ba'ath Party still controlled Iraqi Kurdistan, few had the temerity to inquire after their lost ones, fearing that the same fate might await them or their surviving relatives. Even leaving aside questions of security, few would have knownhow or where to start an inquiry into the labyrinth of the state bureaucracy: with the district head, the qaym maqam? the governor's office? the local police station? the mustashar? the Ba'ath Party? the Army base? the dreaded Amn? But some did take the risk, and their searches--when pieced together with Iraqi government documents and the testimony of those who survived the camps--shed important light on how Anfal worked. It appears to have been a highly compartmentalized operation, with each of the agencies involved knowing only what it needed to know. Only a tiny circle at the heart of the Ba'ath Party machine was ever privy to the whole story about what happened to those who were 'Anfalized.'  * * *   Some survivors came to learn the truth, but only in the most bald and unadorned terms. Rashid, a young shepherd from Chircha Qala, at the foot of Zerda Mountain, had managed to live through Anfal by walking past the troops on the main road with his farm animals. But he lost his mother, ten-year old sister, six-year old brother and two aunts. Later he was drafted into the same army that had captured his family. A sympathetic Christian officer took a liking to Rashid and told him candidly to stop thinking about his relatives: 'All the people from Anfal have been buried with bulldozers.'1  Most, however, did not even discover this much. Nuri, an elderly man from the devastated village of Jelamort, in the Lesser Zab valley, went to the office of the qaym maqam of Chamchamal to inquire after his missing son, daughter-in-law and two-year old granddaughter. The authorities registered their names and told him to come back after three days. When he returned, they said that the governorate could do nothing to help in this case. In fact, the official told Nuri, 'I can do even less than you. You asked, but I am afraid to ask.'2  Salim, a younger man from the Sheikh Bzeini tribal area, had been away from his village when the army came. But the troops had captured his wife and eight children--the eldest a boy of fifteen, the youngest a year-old girl. Some sympathetic jahsh from Salim's own tribehad tried bribing the soldiers, offering them 1,000 dinars ($3,000) for the freedom of each child. It was too late for this, the soldiers answered; the children had already been loaded into the trucks. After Anfal, Salim went on the track of every rumor; he went to Kirkuk, to Topzawa, and even to Nugra Salman. Amn arrested him three times for his persistence. On the last occasion they blindfolded him and warned him never to ask about his family again.3  Mahmoud Tawfiq Muhammad, the elderly head of the Jaff-Roghzayi tribe in one of the worst hit areas of southern Germian, refused to take no for an answer. Twenty members of his immediate family had vanished, most of them small children; Mahmoud had been with them in the fort at Qoratu, but had lost track of them when the sexes were separated at Topzawa. After his own release from Nugra Salman, Mahmoud traveled to the home of Haji Ahmad Fatah, the Kurdish village elder (mukhtar) who had been in charge of the Dibs camp. 'I kissed his shoes and begged him. But I was told not to ask. 'You have nothing to do with it,' they told me. 'Go to Nugra Salman.'' All that the mukhtar would tell the old man was that the Dibs prisoners had been transferred--but he did not know, or would not say, where.  From Dibs, Mahmoud went up to Erbil, where his personal connections enabled him to arrange a meeting with the head of Amn in that city. The security boss told him that the missing had been sent to a place called Ar'ar, an important border crossing point to Saudi Arabia and a resting place for pilgrims on their way to Mecca.4 It was forbidden for anyone to visit or communicate with them. Mahmoud pleaded with the Amn chief, offering him 1,000 dinars for each person freed, but the man said this was impossible: 'Only Saddam Hussein or Ali Hassan al-Majid could free them.'  The civilian governor of Erbil said that he, too, was powerless. Despite Mahmoud's deferential gift of a number of sheep, the Kurdish governor of Suleimaniyeh, Sheikh Ja'far Barzinji,5 told much the samestory: many prisoners, both men and women, were being held in Ar'ar in a facility that was serviced by Egyptian truck drivers in the interests of secrecy. Personally, he could do no more than Mahmoud. The affair rested in the hands of the president and his cousin. But in Kirkuk, the information department of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau told Mahmoud that Majid 'had no time to meet me.' In despair, he went back to Suleimaniyeh, where he approached a certain powerful Kurd who was known to be close to al-Majid and frequently entertained him in his home. The man agreed to intercede personally. 'But Majid swore by the Holy Koran that only Saddam Hussein and God could save the disappeared.' Exhausted and dispirited, Mahmoud abandoned his search.6  * * *   The Ba'ath Party:   Alpha and Omega of the Anfal Campaign   A number of captured Iraqi documents corroborate this kind of anecdotal evidence about the extreme degree to which power was concentrated during the Anfal campaign. Perhaps the most revealing case is that of four brothers, Chaldean Catholics, who disappeared from a Christian village near Gara Mountain in the nahya of Sarseng, in the wake of the Final Anfal.7 Their father 'Isho,' an influential local figure, was interviewed by Middle East Watch in Erbil in July 1992. (see also above p.317) He explained that the family had fled their village before Anfal reached them. His sons--three of them deserters and one a draft-dodger--had surrendered to the army during the five-week grace period that followed the September 6 amnesty; they had last been seen by relatives who were able to visit them in the Nizarkeh fort outside Dohuk. After this sighting, Isho himself tried to visit the fort, but when he arriveda guard told him that all the Christians and Yezidis had been removed the previous day in sealed buses. In Baharka, Isho made inquiries with both Amn and Istikhbarat, demanding to know why his sons had not been brought to the complex with the rest of their family. As non-Kurds, he was told, they were not covered by the September 6 amnesty. They had no information about the young men's present whereabouts. Finally, the family wrote to Saddam Hussein himself, but they never received an answer.8  Six months after this interview, Middle East Watch researchers happened upon the family's file in a box of documents from the Erbil regional office of Istikhbarat. The disappearance of Isho's four sons is the subject of a sequence of a dozen separate 'secret and urgent' documents, beginning with a petition from Isho's sister-in-law to Saddam Hussein, dated January 7, 1989. She writes:  'Mr. President, Commander-in-Chief (May God Protect and Guide Him): My heartiest greetings and great admiration for the builder of Iraq's glory and the realizer of victories over its despicable enemies:  I am the citizen M. ... The four sons of my husband's brother are soldiers enlisted in the Southern Division. Upon your announcement of a general amnesty, they turned themselves in at Dohuk. Since that time, we have heard nothing of their fate.  Victorious and respected sir, please grace me with some knowledge of their fate.  Just as one knocks on the door of your justice, it opens on to the sweet smell of your compassion.'  The petition is signed with the woman's fingerprint.  Since the case involved army deserters and draft dodgers, the presidential office referred it to military intelligence. It appears that Istikhbarat conducted a serious internal investigation into the affair, and that it was genuinely unaware of what had happened to the four men. Although Istikhbarat's Northern Region headquarters complains angrily about the sloppiness of its Mosul and Dohuk offices, and the contradictory quality of their reports, the initial facts of the case are quickly established. The four brothers are known to have surrendered to military units in Atrush on September 10, 1988, four days into the amnesty period, and Mosul Isitikhbarat can find no evidence that they 'bore arms with the saboteurs.' From there the prisoners were transferred to the Party-run Returnee Reception Committee of Dohuk and detained--as their father already knew--in the Nizarkeh fort. Mosul reports that the Dohuk detainees were subsequently split up into two groups. One was sent to a fort in the Daraman area, on the highway between Altun Kupri and Kirkuk. The other was transferred to Topzawa--the only reference so far found to indicate that this Popular Army camp being used for prisoners from the Final Anfal in Badinan.  After this, the trail goes cold. Northern Region Istikhbarat dispatches agents to the Baharka-Jezhnikan complex to interview the family, as well as to each of the army forts along the Kirkuk-Erbil road. But these inquiries yield no fresh information. The Dohuk office might be more helpful, an Istikhbarat captain comments pointedly in his report to the Northern Region director, if it were prodded by the ruling Party. Three days later, however, on March 14, 1989, the director makes his final report to Istikhbarat headquarters. The four men, he writes, 'were handed over to the [Returnee] Reception Committee of Dohuk governorate, which in turn handed them over to the Northern Bureau Command in Ta'mim [Kirkuk] governorate. We have no further information on their fate.'9  * * *   While Istikhbarat was clearly kept in the dark, it seems that even Amn, which wielded such enormous power over the lives of all Iraqis, was unaware of the final destination of those who disappeared during Anfal or surrendered to the authorities under the various amnesty decrees of 1988 and 1989. The archives of Amn headquarters in the governorate of Erbil, for example, are full of requests to local branches for information about hundreds of men, women and children whose relatives have come inquiring about their whereabouts.10 Eventually, as the survivors continued to knock on the door of the powerful security agency seeking 'the sweet smell of compassion,' Amn ordered a change in how its standard response to them would be worded. A handwritten Amn letter notes:  On September 25, 1990, the honorable director issued the following directive: The phrase 'We do not have any information about their fate' will replace the phrase 'They were arrested during the victorious Anfal operation and remain in detention.' The purpose of this is to be accurate in dealing with such an eventuality.'11  Both Amn and Istikhbarat had to defer to the final authority of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau on the matter of those who vanished. Evidence for this can be found, for example, in a communication from Amn Erbil that appears insignificant at first glance. Dated August 26, 1988, this is a brief note informing the agency's municipal office that two women 'have been returned [to Amn] by the Northern Bureau Command, due to the fact that they are not residents of areas that were included in the Anfal operations.' While both women are former residents of villages in the nahya of Taqtaq, which was decimated by Anfal, one had previously been relocated with her family to the city of Erbil and the other to the Qushtapa complex--and were thus not liable to be 'Anfalized.' Conversely, it is clear, it would have been up to the Northern BureauCommand to dispose finally of anyone who was a resident of an area affected by Anfal.12  * * *   Decree no. 160 of March 29, 1987 had made it quite clear that Ali Hassan al-Majid was to enjoy the full authority of the Revolutionary Command Council to orchestrate the efforts of the whole pyramid of other state and party agencies--military, civilian and security--which played a role in Anfal. (see Appendix B, pp. 355-357) And as the captured Iraqi documents and survivor testimonies indicate, it was the Ba'ath Party apparatus in the north, headed by al-Majid, which weighed in its hands the fate of each individual captured in the course of the campaign.  There remain many unsolved mysteries about the Anfal campaign, some of which may be answered by future study of the captured Iraqi documents.13 The identity of the uniformed men who made up the Anfal firing squads may remain forever a secret. Were they Amn agents? Members of the Republican Guard? Or were they, as seems more likely, 'comrades' of the Ba'ath Party itself?14  Why were the women and children only killed in certain areas? Did their execution reflect patterns of combat and resistance, or was some other criterion used? Where are the graves of all those who died, and how many bodies do they hold? The answer cannot conceivably be less than 50,000, and it may well be twice that number. When Kurdish leaders met with Iraqi government officials in the wake of the spring 1991 uprising, they raised the question of the Anfal dead and mentioned a figure of 182,000--a rough extrapolation based on the number of destroyed villages. Ali Hassan al-Majid reportedly jumped to his feet in a rage when the discussion took this turn. 'What is this exaggerated figure of 182,000?' he is said to have asked. 'It couldn't have been more than 100,000'--as if this somehow mitigated the catastrophe that he and his subordinates had visited on the Iraqi Kurds.15  The identity of the executioners, and the precise number of their victims, may never be known--or at least not until the files in Baghdad can be opened. But whatever the answers to these lingering questions, there can be no doubt that the Northern Bureau of the ruling Ba'ath Party, and its parallel Command, headed by RCC member Taher Tawfiq, functioned as both the Alpha and the Omega of the Anfal operation. And it was Ali Hassan al-Majid--'Ali Anfal,' 'Ali Chemical,' Iraqi's present Minister of Defense--who gave the killers their orders.  Al-Majid appears almost defensive in talking about the Anfal operation with unnamed Northern Bureau officials in January 1989. 'How were we supposed to convince them to solve the Kurdish problem and slaughter the saboteurs?' he asks them, alluding to the misgivings of senior military officers about the Anfal operation. In addition, he adds, what was to be done with so many captured civilians? 'Am I supposed to keep them in good shape?' al-Majid asks. 'What am I supposed to do with them, these goats?....[T]ake good care of them? No, I will bury them with bulldozers.' And that is what he did.  ______   1 Middle East Watch interview, Naser complex, March 26, 1993.  2 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, April 23, 1992.  3 Middle East Watch interview, Daratou complex, April 20, 1992.  4 On Ar'ar as a possible mass execution site, see above p.253, footnote 10.  5 Sheikh Ja'far, it should be recalled, was the brother of the notorious Qader Karam mustashar, Sheikh Mu'tassem Barzinji. Sheikh Ja'far was also reportedly the main point of liaison between Ali Hassan al-Majid and the mustashars duringthe Anfal campaign.  6 Middle East Watch interview, Sumoud complex, May 20, 1992.  7 All names and locations in this account have been altered or omitted to protect the witnesses.  8 Middle East Watch interview, Erbil, July 7, 1992. Further information on this case was provided by additional interviews with former residents of the village.  9 Classified correspondence between Istikhbarat national headquarters, Northern Regional headquarters, and Dohuk and Mosul offices, February 12 to March 14, 1989.  It should be recalled that the September 6 amnesty decree stipulated that anyone surrendering after October 9--not the case here--was to be taken into military custody and then handed over to the Northern Bureau Command.  10 The Amn requests examined by Middle East Watch were issued between June and August 1989. They refer, however, to detentions and surrenders as far back as the Second Anfal in April 1988.  11 Handwritten internal memo from the 'Person in Charge of Political Affairs,' Amn Erbil, October 18, 1990.  12 Amn Erbil to Amn municipal command, letter no. Sh2/12809, classified 'secret' and dated August 26, 1988. This document is also an excellent illustration of both the meticulous bureaucratic procedures and the rigid logic of Anfal. Individual detainees were evidently evaluated on a case-by-case basis before a decision was made about their fate. Although it is noted that one of these two women is 'politically independent' and the other a 'housewife,' it is not this which saves them, but their place of residence. This appears to be the key to the logic of the whole Anfal operation.  13 By the time of the publication of this report, Middle East Watch had scrutinized only a small proportion of the Iraqi documents captured by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The results of MEW's continuing research into these unique materials will be detailed in future reports.  14 This tentative conclusion is supported by two factors. One is the known subordination of Amn, Istikhbarat and other agencies to the Ba'ath Party in all aspects of the Anfal campaign. The other is the frequent reference, in Revolutionary Command Council decrees and other documents, to the Party as the agency responsible for executing draft dodgers and deserters--terms whichbecame virtually synonymous, as we have seen, with anyone living in the 'prohibited areas' of the Kurdish countryside.  15 This remark was reported to Middle East Watch by Kurdish officials present at the meeting, and has appeared in a number of press reports. See, inter alia, Makiya, 'The Anfal,' Harper's Magazine, May, 1992, pp.58-59.  Appendix A   The Ali Hassan Al-Majid Tapes   The following are selected remarks by Ali Hassan al-Majid, Secretary General of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Bureau, from a number of meetings with senior Ba'ath officials in 1988 and 1989. Audiotapes of more than a dozen of these meetings were recovered from Iraqi government offices and from al-Majid's home in Kirkuk during the failed Kurdish uprising in March 1991.   1. Meeting with members of the Northern Bureau and governors of the Autonomous Region of Iraqi Kurdistan, April 15, 1988.   By next summer there will be no more villages remaining spread out here and there, but only complexes. It'll be just like the hen when she puts the chicks under her wing. We'll put the people in the complexes and keep an eye on them. We'll no longer let them live in the villages where the saboteurs can go and visit them. Emigration from the villages to the city is necessary in the north of Iraq.   From now on I won't give the villagers flour, sugar, kerosene, water or electricity as long as they continue living there. Let them come closer to me to hear me, so that I can tell them the things I believe and want in ideology, education and common sense. Why should I let them live there like donkeys who don't know anything? For the wheat? I don't want their wheat. We've been importing wheat for the last twenty years. Let's increase it for another five years.   I will prohibit large areas; I will prohibit any presence in them. What if we prohibit the whole basin from Qara Dagh to Kifri to Diyala to Darbandikhan to Suleimaniyeh? What good is this basin? What did we ever get from them? Imagine how much we paid out and lost on those areas. How many good citizens are there among those people, and how many bad ones?   What went wrong? What happened? Thirty, twenty, twenty-five years of saboteur activity. Imagine how many martyrs we have!.... Now you can't go from Kirkuk to Erbil any more without an armored vehicle. All of this basin, from Koysinjaq to here [Kirkuk]...I'm going to evacuateit. I will evacuate it as far as Gweir and Mosul. No human beings except on the main roads. For five years I won't allow any human existence there. I don't want their agriculture. I don't want tomatoes; I don't want okra and cucumbers. If we don't act in this way the saboteurs' activities will never end, not for a million years. These are all just notes, but with the help of God we will apply them very soon, not more than a month from now. In the summer nothing will be left.   2. Meeting with Northern Bureau members and directors of the Ba'ath Party headquarters in the northern governorates: tape is dated May 26, 1988, but from context appears to be 1987.   (Response to a question about the success of the deportation campaign):   As a matter of fact what we have achieved is something that the party and the leadership never managed to do until 1987. Some of it was just the help and mercy of God. Nothing else. Otherwise if you just go and conduct military exercises for the troops who were used in the campaign you will have more casualties than we had. Imagine in such an exercise how many martyrs and casualties there will be!....   What happened? Are these the saboteurs? Are these the people you were afraid of? This is the reality of the saboteurs, and you have all these facilities and this capacity. They could not confront you. In the past they were confronting a division with just a few machine guns. This time they were just shelling us from far away with light artillery.   Some of you who were working here at the time when I arrived, so motivated with this duty, perhaps you said in your hearts, 'OK, wait a minute! Wait a minute! The people who were here before you said the same things and then didn't do anything!' You will be forced to take action. All those years and the saboteurs still existed. At a time when we had this huge military! I swear to God it was not done in that way. All the Iraqi troops couldn't have done what we did. But this [deportation] hurt them. It kills them.   (voice identified as Abu Muhammad: Only God can do more than you. Otherwise you can do anything. This Ba'ath Party can do anything.)   The saboteurs watch the orders and directives. The orders are not that strong. The previous ones were a hundred times stronger. But they were not combined with a belief on the part of those executing them. Now that exists. We said that at that date we will start to implement the deportation campaign. And we did it everywhere, with the help of God. The same day [in 1987] they captured Qara Dagh in retaliation.   Jalal Talabani asked me to open a special channel of communication with him. That evening I went to Suleimaniyeh and hit them with the special ammunition.1 That was my answer. We continued the deportations. I told the mustashars that they might say that they like their villages and that they won't leave. I said I cannot let your village stay because I will attack it with chemical weapons. Then you and your family will die. You must leave right now. Because I cannot tell you the same day that I am going to attack with chemical weapons. I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! The international community and those who listen to them.   Even if the war with Iran stops and the Iranians withdraw from all occupied lands, I will not negotiate with him [Talabani] and I will not stop the deportations.   This is my intention, and I want you to take serious note of it. As soon as we complete the deportations, we will start attacking them everywhere according to a systematic military plan. Even their strongholds. In our attacks we will take back one third or one half of what is under their control. If we can try to take two-thirds, then we will surround them in a small pocket and attack them with chemical weapons. I will not attack them with chemicals just one day, but I will continue to attack them with chemicals for fifteen days. Then I will announce that anyone who wishes to surrender with his gun will be allowed to do so. I will publish one million copies of this leaflet and distribute it in the North, in Kurdish, Sorani, Badinani and Arabic. I will not say it is from the Iraqi government. I will not let the government get involved. I will say it is from here [the Northern Bureau]. Anyone willing to come back is welcome, and those who do not return will be attacked again with new, destructive chemicals. I will not mention the name of the chemicalbecause that is classified information. But I will say with new destructive weapons that will destroy you. So I will threaten them and motivate them to surrender. Then you will see that all the vehicles of God Himself will not be enough to carry them all. I think and expect that they will be defeated. I swear that I am sure we will defeat them.   I told the expert comrades that I need guerrilla groups in Europe to kill whoever they see from them [the saboteurs]. I will do it, with the help of God. I will defeat them and follow them to Iran. Then I will ask the mujaheddin to attack them there.2   3. Meeting with unnamed officials, August 1, 1988.   ...Any Arab who changes his ethnicity to Kurdish is doing so to avoid serving in the army. This is a big problem. What shall we do about it?.... Why did Mosul [governorate] register them as Kurds? We asked them to deport every Kurd who lives there and send them to the mountains to live like goats. Fuck them! Why do you feel embarrassed by them?   We deported them from Mosul without any compensation. We razed their houses. We said come on, go, go! But those who are already fighters, we tell them from the beginning that they must go and settle in the complexes. After that we will tell them to go to the Autonomous Region. We will not get into any arguments with them. I read the pledge for them and they must sign it. Then wherever I find [passage unclear], I will smash their heads. These kind of dogs, we will crush their heads. We will read the pledge for them: I the undersigned admit that I must live and settle in the Autonomous Region. Otherwise I am ready to accept any kind of punishment including the death penalty. Then I will put the pledge in my pocket and tell the Amn director to let him go wherever he wants. After a period of time, I will ask where is he? They will tell me, here he is. The Ba'ath Party director must write to me saying that the following people are living in that place. Immediately I will say blow him away, cut him open like a cucumber.   Do you want to increase the Arab population with these bloody people?.... We must Arabize your area [Mosul]--and only real Arabs, notYezidis who say one day that they are Kurds and the next that they are Arabs. We turned a blind eye to the Yezidi people joining the jahsh in the beginning, in order to stop the saboteurs from increasing. But apart from that, what use are the Yezidis? No use.   4. Northern Bureau meeting to review the campaigns of 1987 and 1988; the tape is undated, but is in a batch dated January 21 and 22, 1989.   The most dangerous stage of the threat to Iraq was between August 1987 and April 1988. It was a dangerous situation. We started to do serious work on the military front from February 18 to September 4, 1988.   All the successive commanders of the First Corps and the Fifth Corps: Lt. Gen. Nazar [al-Khazraji] and Sultan Hashem of the First Corps and Tali'a al-Durri, the martyr al-Hadithi, Muhammad and Ne'ama Fares and Ayad of the Fifth Corps... All these men that I mentioned are commanders who have been serving in the north of Iraq since they were lieutenants. The first one among them to join the Ba'ath Party was Tali'a al-Durri.   When we made the decision to destroy and collectivize the villages and draw a dividing line [i.e. the so-called 'red line'] between us and the saboteurs, the first one to express his doubts to me and before the President was Tali'a al-Durri. The first one who alarmed me was Tali'a al-Durri. To this day the impact of Tali'a is evident. He didn't destroy all the villages that I asked him to at that time. And this is the longest-standing member of the Ba'ath Party. What about the other people then? How were we to convince them to solve the Kurdish problem and slaughter the saboteurs?   So we started to show these senior commanders on TV that [the saboteurs] had surrendered. Am I supposed to keep them in good shape? What am I supposed to do with them, these goats? Then a message reaches me from that great man, the father [i.e. Saddam Hussein], saying take good care of the families of the saboteurs and this and that. The general command brings it to me. I put his message to my head.3   But take good care of them? No, I will bury them with bulldozers. Then they ask me for the names of all the prisoners in order to publish them. I said, 'Weren't you satisfied by what you saw on television and read in the newspaper?' Where am I supposed to put all this enormous number of people? I started to distribute them among the governorates. I had to send bulldozers hither and thither...4   5. Meeting to welcome Hassan Ali al-Amiri, his successor as Secretary General of the Northern Bureau, April 15, 1989.   I would like to admit that I am not and will not be the right person for the current stable situation in the North....For this current peaceful and stable situation, Comrade Hassan Ali is the right person. I am ready to come back and do whatever you think is necessary, though I would like to remain a member of the Northern Bureau.   I hope that the comrades in the North will not ask Comrade Hassan Ali to take administrative measures and do other things that he cannot do. Because that stage is finished. It will no longer be allowed for a member of the leadership to have power over the army, because the exceptional situation is over. These powers are not being withdrawn from Comrade Hassan Ali because he is not up to the task, but because that stage has now finished.   In my first meeting in April 1987 with the army corps commanders, Amn and police directors, governors and Ba'ath Party directors, we decided to deport all the villagers in order to isolate the saboteurs. We made it in two stages. The first stage started on April 21 and ran until May 21. The second stage ran from May 21 to June 21. From June 22 anyone who was arrested in those areas was to be killed immediately without any hesitation, according to the directives which are still in force.   In one of the meetings with the army chiefs of staff I was asked to postpone the campaign for a month by one of our best commanders. I said no, not even for one day. From now on our slogan will be to wipe out saboteur activity. That is our objective. That is the objective of this stage. Anyone who thinks he is not capable of implementing this must tell me now, One of the best commanders, the commander of the FifthCorps, was reluctant, despite me providing him with more facilities than the First Corps. The result now is that the saboteurs are finished, and they had frozen 40 percent of Iraqi power.   When the [September 1988] amnesty was announced, I was about to get mad. But as a responsible party member I said OK. I said probably we will find some good ones among them [the Kurds], since they are our people too. But we didn't find any, never. If you ask me about the senior officials of the Kurds, which ones are good and loyal, I will say only the governors of Erbil and Suleimaniyeh. Apart from those two there are no loyal or good ones.   I cry when I see a tragic show or movie. One day I cried when I saw a woman who was lost and without a family in a movie. But I would like to tell you that I did what I did and what I was supposed to do. I don't think you could do more than what I could do.   I would like to speak about two points: one, arabization; and two, the shared zones between the Arab lands and the Autonomous Region. The point that we are talking about is Kirkuk. When I came, the Arabs and Turkomans were not more than fifty-one percent of the total population of Kirkuk.5 Despite everything, I spent sixty million dinars until we reached the present situation. Now it is clear. For your information, the Arabs who were brought to Kirkuk didn't raise the percentage to sixty percent. Then we issued directives. I prohibited the Kurds from working in Kirkuk, the neighborhoods and the villages around it, outside the Autonomous Region....   Kirkuk is a mixture of nations, religions and doctrines. The people we deported from May 21 to June 21, not one of them was from the prohibited areas. But they were under the control of the saboteurs, whether they were for them or against them.   1 This presumably refers to the April 1987 chemical attack on the PUK headquarters in the Jafati Valley.   2 Following their expulsion from France in 1986, the People's Mujaheddin of Iran relocated to Iraq and came under the patronage of the Ba'ath Party.   3 The sense conveyed in the Arabic phrase is that Saddam Hussein's wish is always al-Majid's command--but not, he goes on to say defensively, in this instance.   4 The tape is cut off in mid-sentence at this point.   5 It is unclear here whether al-Majid is referring to the city or the governorate of Kirkuk.  Appendix B   The Perpetrators of Anfal:   A Road-Map to the Principal Agencies and   Individuals        · The Revolutionary Command Council:   The highest formal authority in Iraq is the ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), headed by President SADDAM HUSSEIN. While Saddam involved himself personally in operational aspects of Anfal through the Office of the Presidency of the Republic, supreme powers for handling Kurdish affairs between 1987-1989 were vested in his cousin, ALI HASSAN AL-MAJID.   · The Ba'ath Arab Socialist Party:   Anfal was a Ba'ath Party operation, commanded by the party's Northern Bureau, buttressed administratively by the Northern Bureau Command and the Northern Affairs Committee of the RCC. Under RCC decree no.160 of March 29, 1987, the Northern Bureau's Secretary General, Ali Hassan al-Majid, was given extraordinary powers over all other state, party, military and security agencies. Al-Majid's co-signatory on Northern Bureau Command orders was TAHER TAWFIQ AL-ANI, secretary of the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee. Deputy Secretary of the Northern Bureau Command was RADHI HASSAN SALMAN.   Under al-Majid's command, the following were the other main agencies involved in Anfal.   · The Iraqi Army and Air Force (including commandos, special forces, chemical weapons units, engineering corps): all field combat operations; village burnings and destruction; mass transportation of detainees. The Iraqi Defense Minister at the time of Anfal was Gen. ADNAN KHAIRALLAH (later deceased). The Army Chief of Staff was Brig. Gen. NIZAR ABD-AL-KARIM AL-KHAZRAJI. Most Anfal operations were handled by the Kirkuk-based First Corps (commander Lt. Gen. SULTAN HASHEM) and the Erbil-based Fifth Corps (commander Brig. Gen. YUNIS MOHAMMED AL-ZAREB).   Lt. Gen. Hashem was also the field commander of the First Anfal operation; Brig. Gen. AYAD KHALIL ZAKI and Brig. Gen. BAREQ ABDULLAH AL-HAJ HUNTA commanded the Second and Third Anfals respectively. The field commanders of other Anfals are not known.   · Republican Guard: elite combat operations during the First and Second Anfals.   · General Military Intelligence Directorate (MUDIRIYAT AL-ISTIKHBARAT AL-ASKARIYEH AL-AMEH): supervision of initial holding facilities such as the Qoratu and Nizarkeh forts; some interrogation; matters affecting draft dodgers and deserters; field command of the jahsh. Two of Istikhbarat's four regional commands played key roles in Anfal. The commander of Eastern Sector Istikhbarat was KHALED MUHAMMAD ABBAS; the commander of Northern Sector Istikhbarat was FARHAN MUTLAQ SALEH.   · General Security Directorate (MUDIRIYAT AL-AMN AL-AMEH) (including the special units of Kurdish agents known as Mafarez Khaseh): case-by-case intelligence-gathering and surveillance of the population; interrogation of prisoners at Topzawa and other detention camps; supervision of informers; tracking down escapees and those sheltering them; monitoring of complexes. The director of Amn for the Kurdistan Autonomous Region was ABD-AL-RAHMAN AZIZ HUSSEIN.   · Emergency Forces (QUWAT AL-TAWARE'): Units under Ba'ath Party command, including members of the jahsh and Amn and police agents, in charge of urban intelligence and counter-terrorism and supervision of initial detention facilities in the city of Suleimaniyeh, and perhaps other locations.   · National Defense Battalions (JAHAFEL AL-DIFA' AL-WATANI, or jahsh): auxiliary role in combat operations; roundups and surrender of prisoners; guard duty at collection points.   · Popular Army (JAYSH AL-SHA'ABI): guard duties at principal transit facilities (Topzawa, Dibs etc.)   · Inter-Agency Committees: a number of inter-agency groups were in charge of discrete aspects of the Anfal operation and associated anti-Kurdish campaigns during the 1987-1989 period. Normally chaired by a Ba'ath Party official, most included representatives of Amn, the Army's First and Fifth Corps and/or Istikhbarat, the Iraqi Police, and civilian authorities. The most notable were the following:   · Returnee Reception Committees (LAJNET ISTIQBAL AL-A'IDIN): responsible for those 'returning to the national ranks' under the General Amnesty between September 6 and October 9, 1988 and other later amnesties;   · Security Committees (LAJNET AL-AMNIYEH) and Committees to Fight Hostile Activity (LAJNET MUKAFAHAT AL-NASHAT AL-MU'ADI): organized to combat the peshmerga at the governorate and local level respectively; and a number of ad hoc committees which monitored the economic blockade of the 'prohibited areas,' controlled food rationing and attempted to prevent smuggling;   · Follow-up Committees (LAJNET AL-MUTABA'A): charged with ensuring compliance with laws governing returnees, tracking down escapees and otherwise tying up the loose ends of the campaign.   In addition, a number of civilian ministries played supportive roles in Anfal: For example, the Agriculture Ministry harvested and disposed of the abandoned 1988 crop; the Finance Ministry administered the confiscated property of 'saboteurs' and oversaw house demolitions; while the Real Estate Bank arranged loans for new housing in the complexes.  Appendix C   Known Chemical Attacks   in Iraqi Kurdistan, 1987-1988   This table includes only those attacks that Middle East Watch has been able to document through eyewitness testimony. The true figure may be considerably higher, since we have received many other unconfirmed reports and allegations of chemical weapons attacks during 1987-1988. Based on our field interviews, at least sixty villages, as well as the town of Halabja, were attacked with mustard gas, nerve gas, or a combination of the two;   The Iraqi regime appears to have used chemical weapons for at least four complementary purposes:   (a) To attack base camps and main-force concentrations of Kurdish peshmerga. This logic accounts for many of the attacks on the Jafati valley (First Anfal), the Qara Dagh area (Second Anfal), the Balisan and Smaquli valleys (Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Anfals) and Zewa Shkan (Final Anfal);     (b) To harass and kill retreating peshmerga as Anfal progressed. Attacks of this sort include those on Shanakhseh (#14 in the accompanying table), Zerda mountain (#19), Tazashar (#20) and the Shaqlawa-Rawanduz area (#26 and 27);   (c) To inflict exemplary collective punishment on civilians for their support for the peshmerga. The most dramatic case is the bombing of Halabja after the seizure of the town by peshmerga and Iranian revolutionary guards. Others include the 1987 attacks on Sheikh Wasan and Balisan (#4), and the Anfal attacks on Sayw Senan (#15) and Goktapa (#22);   (d) To spread terror amongst the civilian population as a whole, flushing villagers out of their homes to facilitate their capture, relocation and killing. The opening of almost every phase of the Anfal campaign was marked by attacks of this sort, but they are most apparent in the Final Anfal (Khatimat al-Anfal) in the Badinan region, where more than thirtyvillages were bombed simultaneously along an east-west strip on the morning of August 25, 1988.   While a distinction between these different kinds of targets is helpful in understanding the tactical thinking behind the Iraqi campaign, it is without meaning in legal terms. Chemical weapons are by their nature indiscriminate, and their use is outlawed under any circumstances.

"       Case Study: The Anfal Campaign (Iraqi Kurdistan), 1988  Summary  The anti-Kurdish 'Anfal' campaign, mounted between February and September 1988 by the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein, was both genocidal and gendercidal in nature. 'Battle-age' men were the primary targets of Anfal, according to Human Rights Watch/Middle East (hereafter, HRW/ME). The organization writes in its book Iraq's Crime of Genocide: 'Throughout Iraqi Kurdistan, although women and children vanished in certain clearly defined areas, adult males who were captured disappeared en masse. ... It is apparent that a principal purpose of Anfal was to exterminate all adult males of military service age captured in rural Iraqi Kurdistan' (pp. 96, 170). Only a handful survived the execution squads.   The background   The Kurds are considered the world's largest nation without a state of their own. Numbering approximately 20-25 million people, their traditional territory is divided among the modern states of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria, with a small number in the states of the former Soviet Union. Just over four million of these Kurds live in Iraq, constituting about 23 percent of the population.      In the wake of World War I, with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's call for 'self-determination' echoing loudly, the Kurds were promised a homeland -- Kurdistan -- in the Treaty of Sèvres (1920). However, the victorious allies backed away from their pledge in an attempt to court the new Turkish regime of Kemal Ataturk, and in fear of destabilizing Iraq and Syria, which were granted to Britain and France, respectively, as mandated territories. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne thus reneged on Kurdish independence and divided the Kurds among Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. Ataturk's discrimination against Turkey's Kurdish population began almost immediately, with Kurdish political groups and manifestations of cultural identity banned outright. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the Kurds of Iran, with Soviet support, succeeded in establishing the first independent Kurdish state (the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad). But this was quickly crushed by Iranian troops.   In 1946, an Iraqi Kurd, Mustafa Barzani, founded the Kurdistan Democratic Party - Iraq (KDP). Barzani died in 1979, but the KDP remains one of the most prominent Kurdish resistance organizations. Its more radical rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was founded in 1975 by Jalal Talabani. It was the PUK that would bear the brunt of the Anfal campaign in 1988.   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The ascent to power of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 1968 (though he did not become president until 1979) at first seemed to augur well for the Iraqi Kurds. In 1970, Saddam's Ba'ath Party reached a wideranging agreement with the Kurdish rebel groops, granting the Kurds the right to use and broadcast their language, as well as a considerable degree of political autonomy. But the agreement broke down when the Ba'ath Party 'embarked on the Arabization of the oil-producing areas in Kurdistan, evicting Kurdish farmers and replacing them with poor Arab tribesmen [and women] from the south, guarded by government troops.' In March 1974, the KDP rose up against Saddam, sparking a fullscale war the following year, when some 130,000 Kurds fled to Iran. 'In March 1975,' writes Khaled Salih, 'tens of thousands of villagers from the Barzani tribes were forcibly removed from their homes and relocated to barren sites in the desert south of Iraq, where they had to rebuild their lives by themselves, without any form of assistance.' (Khaled, 'Anfal: The Kurdish Genocide in Iraq'.)   It was these displaced populations of Barzani tribespeople who, after the onset of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980, would fall prey to one of the largest gendercidal massacres of modern times. Martin van Bruinessen writes:    In [July-]August 1983, Iraqi security troops rounded up the men of the Barzani tribe from four resettlement camps near Arbil. These people were not engaged in any antigovernment activities. ... Two of Barzani's sons at that time led the Kurdistan Democratic Party and were engaged in guerrilla activities against the Baghdad government, but only a part of the tribe was with them. ... All eight thousand men of this group, then, were taken from their families and transported to southern Iraq. Thereafter they disappeared. All efforts to find out what happened to them or where they had gone, including diplomatic inquiries by several European countries, failed. It is feared that they are dead. The KDP [Kurdish Democratic Party] has received consistent reports from sources within the military that at least part of this group has been used as guinea pigs to test the effects of various chemical agents. (van Bruinessen, 'Genocide in Kurdistan?,' in George J. Andreopoulos, ed., Genocide: Conceptual and Historical Dimensions ([University of Pennsylvania Press, 1994], pp. 156-57, emphasis added.)   One Barzani woman described the roundup of the menfolk: 'Before dawn, as people were getting dressed and ready to go to work, all the soldiers charged through the camp [Qushtapa]. They captured the men walking on the street and even took an old man who was mentally deranged and was usually left tied up. They took the preacher who went to the mosque to call for prayers. They were breaking down doors and entering the houses searching for our men. They looked inside the chicken coops, water tanks, refrigerators, everywhere, and took all the men over the age of thirteen. The women cried and clutched the Qur'an [Koran] and begged the soldiers not to take their men away.' In 1993, Saddam Hussein strongly hinted at the final fate of the Barzani men: 'They betrayed the country and they betrayed the covenant, and we meted out a stern punishment to them, and they went to hell.' As Human Rights Watch noted, 'In many respects, the 1983 Barzani operation foreshadowed the techniques that would be used on a much larger scale during the Anfal campaign.' (Human Rights Watch, Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 4, 26-27.) Khaled Salih notes that 'No doubt, the absence of any international outcry encouraged Baghdad to believe that it could get away with an even larger operation without any hostile reaction. In this respect the Ba'ath Party seems to have been correct in its calculations and judgement of the international inaction.' (Khaled, 'Anfal: The Kurdish Genocide in Iraq'; see also 'Who was responsible?,' below.)   Aftermath of Iraqi chemical attack on Halabji, March 1988. Among the most horrific features of the Iraqi campaigns against the Kurds in the 1980s was the regime's resort to chemical weapons strikes against civilian populations. On April 16, 1987, a chemical raid on the Balisan valley killed dozens of civilians; in its wake, 'some seventy men were taken away in buses and, like the Barzanis, never seen again. The surviving women and children were dumped on the plain outside Erbil and left to fend for themselves.' (Jonathan C. Randal, After Such Knowledge, What Forgiveness?, p. 230.) Less than a year later, on March 16, 1988, a far more concentrated chemical attack was launched on the town of Halabji, near the Iranian border, which had briefly been held by a combined force of Kurdish rebels and Iranian troops. Thousands of civilians died, and with the town still under Iranian occupation after the raid, journalists and photographers were able to reach the scene. 'Their photographs, mainly of women, children, and elderly people huddled inertly in the streets or lying on their backs with mouths agape, circulated widely, demonstrating eloquently that the great mass of the dead had been Kurdish civilian noncombatants.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 72.) Although it took place during the Anfal campaign, however, the attack on Halabji is not normally considered part of that campaign.   The gendercide   The male is born to be slaughtered.       - Kurdish proverb  Your men have gone to hell.       - Iraqi soldier to a survivor of the attack on Qaranaw village, Fourth Anfal, May 1988   In March 1987, Saddam Hussein's cousin from his hometown of Tikrit, Ali Hassan al-Majid, was appointed secretary-general of the Ba'ath Party's Northern Region, which included Iraqi Kurdistan. Under al-Majid, who 'even by the standards of the Ba'ath security apparatus ... had a particular reputation for brutality,' control of policies against the Kurdish insurgents passed from the Iraqi army to the Ba'ath Party itself. This was the prelude to the intended 'final solution' to the Kurdish problem undertaken within months of al-Majid's arrival in his post. It would be known as 'al-Anfal' ('The Spoils'), a reference to the eighth sura of the Qur'an, which details revelations that the Prophet Muhammad received after the first great victory of Islamic forces in A.D. 624. 'I shall cast into the unbelievers' hearts terror,' reads one of the verses; 'so smite above the necks, and smite every finger of them ... the chastisement of the Fire is for the unbelievers.' Anfal, officially conducted between February 23 and September 6, 1988, would have eight stages altogether, seven of them targeting areas controlled by the PUK. For these assaults, the Iraqis mustered up to 200,000 soldiers with air support -- matched against Kurdish guerrilla forces that numbered no more than a few thousand.   On June 20, 1987, a crucial directive for the Anfal campaign, SF/4008, was issued under al-Majid's signature. Of greatest significance is clause 5. Referring to those areas designated 'prohibited zones,' al-Majid ordered that 'all persons captured in those villages shall be detained and interrogated by the security services and those between the ages of 15 and 70 shall be executed after any useful information has been obtained from them, of which we should be duly notified.' However, it seems clear from the application of this policy that 'those between the ages of 15 and 70' meant 'those males' in the designated age range. HRW/ME, for example, takes this as given, writing that clause 5's 'order [was] to kill all adult males,' and later: 'Under the terms of al-Majid's June 1987 directives, death was the automatic penalty for any male of an age to bear arms who was found in an Anfal area.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 11, 14.) A subsequent directive on September 6, 1987, supports this conclusion: it calls for 'the deportation of ... families to the areas where there saboteur relatives are ..., except for the male [members], between the ages of 12 inclusive and 50 inclusive, who must be detained.' (Cited in Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 298.)   Accordingly, when captured Kurdish populations were transported to detention centres (notably the concentration camp of Topzawa near the city of Kirkuk), they were subjected to the classic process of gendercidal selection: separating adult and teenage males from the remainder of the community. According to HRW/ME,   With only minor variations ... the standard pattern for sorting new arrivals [at Topzawa was as follows]. Men and women were segregated on the spot as soon as the trucks had rolled to a halt in the base's large central courtyard or parade ground. The process was brutal ... A little later, the men were further divided by age, small children were kept with their mothers, and the elderly and infirm were shunted off to separate quarters. Men and teenage boys considered to be of an age to use a weapon were herded together. Roughly speaking, this meant males of between fifteen and fifty, but there was no rigorous check of identity documents, and strict chronological age seems to have been less of a criterion than size and appearance. A strapping twelve-year-old might fail to make the cut; an undersized sixteen-year-old might be told to remain with his female relatives. ... It was then time to process the younger males. They were split into smaller groups. ... Once duly registered, the prisoners were hustled into large rooms, or halls, each filled with the residents of a single area. ... Although the conditions at Topzawa were appalling for everyone, the most grossly overcrowded quarter seem to have been those where the male detainees were held. ... For the men, beatings were routine. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 143-45.)   After a few days of such treatment, without a single known exception, the men thus 'processed' were trucked off to be killed in mass executions. According to HRW/ME, the 'standard operating procedures' of the gendercidal killings (extended, in some cases, to other segments of the population -- see below) were 'uncannily reminiscent of ... the activities of the Einsatzkommandos, or mobile killing units, in the Nazi-occupied lands of Eastern Europe':   Some groups of prisoners were lined up, shot from the front, and dragged into predug mass graves; others were made to lie down in pairs, sardine-style, next to mounds of fresh corpses, before being killed; still others were tied together, made to stand on the lip of the pit, and shot in the back so that they would fall forward into it -- a method that was presumably more efficient from the point of view of the killers. Bulldozers then pushed earth or sand loosely over the heaps of corpses. Some of the grave sites contained dozens of separate pits and obviously contained the bodies of thousands of victims. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 12.)   Excavating the skeleton of a Kurdish man killed at Koreme, final Anfal. The genocidal and gendercidal focus of the Iraqi killing campaign varied from one stage of Anfal to another. No mass killings of civilians appear to have taken place during first Anfal (February 23-March 19, 1988). The most exclusive targeting of the male population, meanwhile, occurred during the final Anfal (August 25-September 6, 1988). This was launched immediately after the signing of a ceasefire with Iran, which allowed the transfer of large amounts of men and matériel from the southern battlefronts. It focused on 'the steep, narrow valleys of Badinan, a four-thousand-square mile chunk of the Zagros Mountains bounded on the east by the Greater Zab River and on the north by Turkey.' Here, uniquely in the Anfal campaigns, lists of the 'disappeared' provided to HRW/ME by survivors 'invariably included only adult and teenage males, with the signal exception of Assyrian and Caldean Christians and Yezidi Kurds,' who were subsidiary targets of the slaughter. Many of the men of Badinan did not even make it as far as 'processing' stations, being simply 'lined up and murdered at their point of capture, executed by firing squads on the authority of a local army officer.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 178, 190, 192; on the fate of the Christians and Yezidi Kurds, see pp. 209-13.) The best-known case is the assault on the village of Koreme, where a forensic investigation conducted by Middle East Watch and Physicians for Human Rights in May-June 1992 uncovered the bodies of 27 men and adolescent boys executed on August 28. (See Middle East Watch/Physicians for Human Rights, The Anfal Campaign in Iraqi Kurdistan: The Destruction of Koreme [Human Rights Watch, 1993].)   Even amidst this most systematic slaughter of adult men and boys, however, 'hundreds of women and young children perished, too,' though 'the causes of their deaths were different -- gassing, starvation, exposure, and willful neglect -- rather than bullets fired from a Kalashnikov [rifle].' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 191.) The fate of other segments of the Kurdish community throughout Anfal receives attention in the following section.   Genocide against women, the elderly, and children   In its landmark study of the Iraqi genocide in Kurdistan, HRW/ME calls the decisions surrounding the deaths of thousands of women, children, and elderly Kurds 'one of the great enigmas of the Anfal campaign.' 'Many thousands of women and children perished,' the organization notes, 'but their deaths were subject to extreme regional variations, with most being residents of two distinct 'clusters' that were affected by the third and fourth Anfals.' One factor apparently was 'whether the [Iraqi] troops encountered armed resistance in a given area,' something which characterized 'most, but not all, the areas marked by the killing of women and children.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 13, 96.)   The hardest-hit area of all appears to have been the region of southern Germian, abutting the Arab heartland of Iraq, which was targeted during the third Anfal (April 7-20, 1988). Southern Germian was apparently a special focus for 'root-and-branch' genocide because it was the heartland of the PUK resistance and strongly supportive of the Kurdish PUK rebels. 'Although males aged fifteen to fifty routinely vanished from all parts of Germian,' writes HRW/ME, 'only in the south did the disappeared include significant numbers of women and children. Most were from the Daoudi and Jaff-Roghyazi tribes,' and they accounted for more than half the 'disappeared' in the affected regions. Mass executions involving 'an estimated two thousand women and children' took place at a site on Hamrin Mountain, between the cities of Tikrit and Kirkuk. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 115, 171.)   Taimour being interviewed. One such execution left a survivor, a young boy named Taimour Abdullah Ahmad, 'the only eyewitness to the mass killing of women and children' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. 171). His account received extensive attention in the western press, and describes scenes virtually identical to the Einsatzgruppen-style massacres of 'battle-aged' males which preceded the killing of women, children, and the elderly from southern Germian. For a lengthy interview with Taimour, see 'An Interview with the Anfal Survivor, Taimour'.   Most members of the Kurdish community who remained after 'battle-age' men had been 'disappeared' were trucked off to resettlement camps to the south. To the extent that women, children, and the elderly were killed in mass executions, these were usually perpetrated after a period of detention in such camps. Those not slaughtered in this fashion were usually transported to relocation camps where conditions were squalid and unsanitary; thousands -- especially children -- died from deprivation and neglect.   The infrastructure of life in Iraqi Kurdistan, meanwhile, was left almost totally destroyed by the Anfal campaign and its predecessors. 'By the time the genocidal frenzy ended, 90% of Kurdish villages, and over twenty small towns and cities, had been wiped off the map. The countryside was riddled with 15 million landmines, intended to make agriculture and husbandry impossible. A million and a half Kurdish peasants had been interned in camps. ... About 10% of the total Kurdish population of Iraq had perished [since 1974].' (Kendal Nezan, 'When our 'friend' Saddam was gassing the Kurds', Le Monde diplomatique, March 1998.)   How many died?   According to HRW/ME, 'at least fifty thousand rural Kurds ... died in Anfal alone, and very possibly the real figure was twice that number ... All told, the total number of Kurds killed over the decade since the Barzani men were taken from their homes is well into six figures.' 'On the basis of extensive interviews in Kurdistan and perusal of extant Iraqi documents, Shoresh Resoul, a meticulous Kurdish researcher ... conservatively estimated that 'between 60,000 and 110,000' died during [al-]Majid's Kurdish mandate,' i.e., beginning shortly before Anfal and ending shortly afterwards. (Randal, After Such Knowledge ..., p. 214.) Other Kurdish estimates are even higher. 'When Kurdish leaders met with Iraqi government officials in the wake of the spring 1991 uprising, they raised the question of the Anfal dead and mentioned a figure of 182,000 -- a rough extrapolation based on the number of destroyed villages. Ali Hassan al-Majid reportedly jumped to his feet in a rage when the discussion took this turn. 'What is this exaggerated figure of 182,000?' he is said to have asked. 'It couldn't have been more than 100,000' -- as if this somehow mitigated the catastrophe that he and his subordinates had visited on the Iraqi Kurds.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 14, 230.)   It is impossible to state with certainty what proportion of the victims of Anfal were adult men and adolescent boys. The most detailed investigation, conducted by HRW/ME, tabulated the number of 'disappeared' from the various stages of Anfal, based on field interviews with some 350 survivors. The organization gathered the names of 1,255 men, 184 women, and 359 children -- 'only a fraction of the numbers lost during Anfal.' This would suggest that some 87 percent of the adults 'disappeared,' all of whom were apparently executed, were male; and that about 70 percent of all those who 'disappeared' were 'battle-age' males. (See Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. 266-68.) These calculations do not, however, include the large number of Kurdish civilians killed indiscriminately in chemical attacks and other generalized assaults.  Most recently, Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, has referred to '100,000 Kurdish men and boys machine-gunned to death during the 1988 Anfal genocide.' (Roth, 'Show Trials Are Not the Solution to Saddam's Heinous Reign', The Globe and Mail, 18 July 2003.)   Who was responsible?   The tens of thousands of Anfal deaths, according to HRW/ME,   did not come in the heat of battle -- as 'collateral damage,' in the military euphemism. Nor were they the result of acts of aberration by individual commanders whose excesses passed unnoticed or unpunished by their superiors. Rather, these Kurds were systematically put to death in large numbers by order of the central Iraqi government in Baghdad days or weeks after being rounded up in villages marked for destruction or while fleeing army assaults in 'prohibited areas.' ... Documentary materials captured from the Iraqi intelligence agencies demonstrate with great clarity that the mass killings, disappearances, and forced relocations associated with Anfal and the other anti-Kurdish campaigns of 1987-89 were planned in a coherent fashion. Although power over these campaigns was highly centralized, their success depended on the orchestration of the efforts of a large number of agencies and institutions at the local, regional, and national level, from the office of the president of the republic down to the lowliest jahsh [pro-Iraqi Kurdish] unit. (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, pp. xvii, 9-10. For more on the role of the pro-regime Kurdish forces, which were crucial in the Anfal roundups, see pp. 109-12, and Kanan Makiya, Cruelty and Silence, pp. 143-45.)   Noam Chomsky called Saddam Hussein's Iraq 'perhaps the most violent and repressive state in the world.' (Quoted in Makiya, Cruelty and Silence, p. 273; see also the analysis of Iraqi conscription policies elsewhere on this site.) Atop the state structure stood the murderous dictator. In classic 'patrimonial' fashion, Saddam constructed a brutal one-party regime consisting largely of his relatives from Tikrit and surrounding areas. (For a powerful description of Saddam's rule-by-terror, see Kanan Makiya, Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq.) The Ba'ath Party's 'point man' during the worst of the atrocities in Iraqi Kurdistan was, as noted, Ali Hassan al-Majid. After Anfal, he was transferred from his post, to become -- in August 1990 -- the governor of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.   Saddam Hussein admires portraits of himself.   Saddam's dictatorship reached to the grassroots of Iraqi society through the intertwined institutions of the Ba'ath Party and the Iraqi army and security forces. At every level, its violence exhibited strong patriarchal overtones. Jonathan Randal describes the 'perverted form of male bonding' evident in an internal purge that Saddam carried out in 1979, in which 'surviving ministers and senior party officials [were obliged] to join the firing squad which executed the condemned men.' The 'pattern [was] repeated throughout the chain of command: from the lowliest secret-police operative on up they shared responsibility in the executions, thus enforcing loyalty and subservience to Saddam Hussein.' Such practices 'were also useful in intimidating anyone less inclined to terror and cruelty.' (Randal, After Such Knowledge ..., p. 208.)   The international community must accept a share of the blame for Saddam's genocide against the Iraqi Kurds. For the duration of the Iran-Iraq war -- which also witnessed most of the horrors against the Kurds -- Saddam was considered an important bulwark against the spread of Iranian-style Islamic fundamentalism to the strategic and oil-rich countries of the Middle East. Accordingly, the West supplied and armed him throughout his campaigns against both the Iranians and the Kurds, eventually providing the critical intelligence information that allowed Iraq to emerge victorious in the war against Iran. In August 1988 -- with the Anfal campaign nearly over, and in the wake of a year-and-a-half of vicious chemical attacks on civilian populations -- 'the United Nations Sub-Committee on Human Rights voted by 11 votes to 8 not to condemn Iraq for human rights violations. Only the Scandinavian countries, Australia and Canada, together with bodies like the European Parliament and the Socialist International, saved their honour by clearly condemning Iraq.' (Nezan, 'When our 'friend' Saddam was gassing the Kurds'.)   The aftermath   Kurdish rebels seize control in 1991. In August 1990, the Iraqi regime finally overreached with its invasion of neighbouring Kuwait, sparking the Gulf War, in which a U.S.-led coalition succeeded in expelling the Iraqi occupying forces. At the tail end of the war, in March 1991, the Kurdish population of northern Iraq launched a general uprising against the Iraqi regime, and briefly managed to expel it from the region. When the Iraqis counterattacked, nearly half a million Kurds fled to Turkey and Iran; the resultant humanitarian crisis led the members of the Allied coalition to declare a 'safe haven' in the northern part of Iraqi Kurdistan. A coalition of seven Kurdish parties then established authority over the enclave, which exists to the present day -- despite the outbreak of serious fighting between the PUK and KDP in May 1994, which killed an estimated 1,000 people. In September 1998, the two rebel groups forged a new power-sharing agreement brokered by the United States.  During the March 1991 uprising, Kurdish forces managed to seize some four million documents from Iraqi archives in the region, and transported these to safe areas. These documents, combined with the investigative missions undertaken in the Kurdish zone by HRW/ME and other organizations, allowed a definitive reconstruction of the events of Anfal. As HRW/ME noted, 'To have the opportunity to speak to survivors of human rights violations, to dig up the bones of those who had not survived, and then to read the official account of what had taken place -- all while the regime that had carried out the outrages was still in power -- was unique in the annals of human rights research.' (Iraq's Crime of Genocide, p. xx.) In light of this mountain of documentation, eyewitness testimony, and forensic data, the organization announced its 'confidence' that 'concerning the crucial 1987-1989 period ... the evidence is sufficiently strong to prove a case of genocidal intent on the part of the Iraqi Government,' and has called for the creation of a war-crimes tribunal at the Hague such as those established for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, and Kosovo. (HRW/ME, Bureaucracy of Repression: The Iraqi Government in Its Own Words [Human Rights Watch, 1994], p. x.)   A number of observers have noted the still-visible evidence of gendercide among the Kurdish population of northern Iraq. In September 1988, as Anfal was officially winding down, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, 'recalled travelling westward from Sulaimaniyah ... and coming across large groups of disconsolate women and children standing next to their meager bundled belongings on the roadside. 'They were obviously without menfolk. I suspected the authorities meant me to see them.'' (Randal, After Such Knowledge ..., p. 223.) In 1999, the Christian Aid organization noted that 'Many Kurdish households are headed by widows -- their husbands have disappeared.' ('Working in Iraq: Christian Aid's Experience 1990-98'.) Retired U.S. Brigadier-General Jeffrey Pilkington, who commanded the relief campaign 'Operation Provide Comfort' in 1993-94, reported from a trip to the Kurdish zone that   The signs of almost total economic stagnation were everywhere. Fields were mostly bare -- for lack of fertilizer or insecticide or because there was no market for the wheat grown or no-one who could afford to buy it. Factories which had employed hundreds of workers were now deserted. ... Many villages were populated by only women and children, the majority of men having been detained or killed. (Pilkington, 'Beyond Humanitarian Relief: Economic Development Efforts in Northern Iraq', in Forced Migration Review.)   Likewise, the Iraq Assessment undertaken by the Country Information and Policy Unit of the British Home Office (April 2000) stated that 'there is an unusually high percentage of women in the Kurdish areas, purportedly caused by the disappearances of tens of thousands of Kurdish men during the Anfal Campaign. The Special Rapporteur reported that the widows, daughters, and mothers of the Anfal Campaign victims are economically dependent on their relatives or villages because they may not inherit the property or assets of their missing family members.' (On the plight of the widows of the Anfal victims, see also Teresa Thornhill, 'Anfal Widows: Saddam's Genocide,' New Internationalist, no. 247 [September 1993].)   In March 2003, the United States launched its long-threatened invasion to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein, which collapsed after only brief resistance, although substantial guerrilla resistance was continuing at the time of writing. In the wake of the regime's disappearance, Iraqis across the country began digging up mass graves of those executed by Saddam's forces. According to the Baltimore Sun (6 May 2003), 'Human rights groups estimate up to 300,000 Iraqis disappeared over the past 23 years, the vast majority of them men and teen-age boys.' However, Sun reporter Todd Richissin noted noted that early exhumations showed that 'Hussein's deadly sweeps took in mothers [and] sisters, too,' in the words of the article's headline, which cited 'female victims ... [found] in unexpected numbers.' With regard to Anfal, it was a poignant fact that, as of December 2003, 'in the eight months since the Iraqi dictator was deposed, not a single person who disappeared during the Anfal military campaign of 1988 has returned alive.' (Richard C. Paddock, 'An Awful Truth Sinks In', Los Angeles Times, December 5, 2003.)   In December 2003, U.S. forces announced the capture of a dishevelled Saddam (see photo), hiding in a hole at a farmhouse along the Tigris River, within sight of one of his former palaces. It was unclear what type of tribunal he faced for his crimes, but there was now the possibility of administering justice for some of his many atrocities, including the genocidal ravages of the Anfal Campaign against Iraqi Kurds.

"       http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/2001/iraq08152001.html  AI INDEX: MDE 14/008/2001     15 August 2001 IRAQ  Systematic torture of political prisoners    1 INTRODUCTION  Torture is used systematically against political detainees in Iraqi prisons and detention centres. The scale and severity of torture in Iraq can only result from the acceptance of its use at the highest level. There are no attempts to curtail or prevent such violations or punish those responsible. This total disregard for a basic human right, the right not to be tortured or ill-treated, grossly violates international human rights law which prohibits torture in all circumstances. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Iraq ratified in 1971, states that ''No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment''(Article 7).  Amnesty International has over the years received numerous reports of torture and interviewed hundreds of torture victims. The organization has also published many reports documenting a wide range of human rights violations in the country, including torture and ill-treatment. Victims of torture in Iraq have been subjected to a wide range of forms of torture. The bodies of many of those executed had evident signs of torture, including the gouging out of the eyes, marks of severe beatings and electric shocks to various parts of the body, when returned to their families. Some detainees died as a result of torture. Many torture victims now live with permanent physical or psychological damage.  Torture is used both to extract information or confessions from detainees and as a punishment. Political detainees are tortured immediately following arrest and their torture generally takes place in the headquarters of the General Security Directorate in Baghdad or in its branches in Baghdad and in the governorates. Torture also takes place in the headquarters of the General Intelligence (al-Mukhabarat al-'Amma) in al-Hakimiya in Baghdad, its branches elsewhere, as well as in police stations and detention centres such as al-Radhwaniya. Detainees in these places are held incommunicado for months or even years without access to any lawyers or family visits.  Victims of torture have included suspected government opponents who range from army, security and intelligence officers suspected of having contacts with the Iraqi opposition abroad or accused of plotting against the government, to followers of leading Shi'a Muslim religious personalities. Torture has also been used against women suspected of having links with Shi'a Islamist groups in the country or simply because of family links. In many cases relatives of those active in the Iraqi opposition abroad have been tortured or ill-treated as a way of putting pressure on those opposition leaders to cease their activities.  Iraq's legislation prohibits the use of torture. Article 22(a) of Iraq's Interim Constitution states that ''the dignity of the person is safeguarded. It is inadmissible to cause any physical or psychological harm''. Article 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that ''it is not permissible to use any illegal means to influence the accused to secure his statement. Mistreatment, threatening to harm, inducement, threats, menace, psychological influence, and the use of narcotics, intoxicants and drugs are all considered illegal means.'' In fact the Iraqi Penal Code criminalizes the use of torture by any public servant. Article 333 states that ''any employee or public servant who tortures, or orders the torture of an accused, witness, or expert in order to compel that person to confess to committing a crime, to give a statement or information, to hide certain matters, or to give a specific opinion will be punished by imprisonment or detention. The use of force or threats is considered to be torture''. Amnesty International is not aware of any instances where officials suspected of torture of detainees have been brought to justice.  In the mid-1990s Iraq introduced judicial punishments such as amputation of hand and foot, branding of forehead and cutting off of the ears, and many people have been left with permanently mutilated bodies as a result of such punishments. Such punishments have been described as cruel, inhuman and degrading by international human rights bodies. The Iraqi Government justified the introduction of these punishments by the increase in the crime rate which it attributed to the impact of economic sanctions imposed on the country since 1990.  Iraq continues to be subjected to comprehensive trading sanctions imposed by UN Security Council resolutions since 1990 in the aftermath of its occupation of Kuwait. The sanctions have, according to many international experts, journalists, non-governmental organizations and UN agencies, crippled Iraq's economic infrastructure and have resulted in the breakdown of the socio-cultural fabric of the society, acute poverty, malnutrition, wide-spread corruption and crime, and the reported deaths of over half a million children under the age of five.(1) It is, however, the responsibility of the Iraqi Government to uphold the rule of law and respect of human rights.  The international community has been concerned about the human rights situation in Iraq for many years and therefore decided in 1991 to appoint a Special Rapporteur in order to report regularly to the UN Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Iraq.  2 METHODS OF TORTURE  Torture victims in Iraq have been blindfolded, stripped of their clothes and suspended from their wrists for long hours. Electric shocks have been used on various parts of their bodies, including the genitals, ears, the tongue and fingers. Victims have described to Amnesty International how they have been beaten with canes, whips, hosepipe or metal rods and how they have been suspended for hours from either a rotating fan in the ceiling or from a horizontal pole often in contorted positions as electric shocks were applied repeatedly on their bodies. Some victims had been forced to watch others, including their own relatives or family members, being tortured in front of them.  Other methods of physical torture described by former victims include the use of Falaqa (beating on the soles of the feet), extinguishing of cigarettes on various parts of the body, extraction of finger nails and toenails and piercing of the hands with an electric drill. Some have been sexually abused and others have had objects, including broken bottles, forced into their anus. In addition to physical torture, detainees have been threatened with rape and subjected to mock execution. They have been placed in cells where they could hear the screams of others being tortured and have been deprived of sleep. Some have stayed in solitary confinement for long periods of time. Detainees have also been threatened with bringing in a female relative, especially the wife or the mother, and raping her in front of the detainee. Some of these threats have been carried out.  3 VICTIMS OF TORTURE  3.1 Followers of Shi'a Clerics  Over the years many victims of torture have been Shi'a Muslims from Baghdad or from southern Iraq. They were arrested and tortured because they were suspected of anti-government activities. Many of them were students at al-Hawza al-'Ilmiya in al-Najaf in the south, which is considered to be one of the most prestigious theological teaching institutions in Shi'a Islam. Mass arrests and torture often took place during the periods of unrest which southern Iraq has witnessed intermittently over the last few years. The murder in al-Najaf of Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, a prominent leading Shi'a cleric, and his two sons on 19 February 1999(2) sparked off riots in predominantly Shi'a districts in Baghdad, especially in Saddam City (also known as al-Thawra City), and in southern towns of al-Hilla, Karbala', al-Nassiriya and al-Najaf. Protests in Saddam City resulted in the killings of dozens of protesters by the security forces and the arrest of hundreds of people. The riots lasted for three days and according to press reports at least 100 people were killed in Baghdad alone.(3)  A month later riots erupted in Basra for three days between 17 and 20 March 1999 during which the local headquarters of the ruling Ba'ath Party was attacked and several government officials were killed by armed Iraqi Shi'a Islamists, some of whom were reportedly sent by Iraqi Shi'a opposition groups based in Iran. As soon as government forces regained control of Basra on 20 March the repression started with dozens of people executed following torture and hundreds of others were arrested and tortured.  On 16 April 1999 violent clashes were reported between protesters and security forces when the latter attempted to prevent Shi'a Muslims from taking part in Friday prayers at the al-Hikma Mosque in Saddam City in Baghdad. These clashes reportedly left scores of protesters dead. An eye witness told Amnesty International that ''when people were prevented from prayers they started shouting slogans against the authorities. Some protesters were armed and started shooting at the security forces but the latter were using tanks against the population and many people, including children, were killed. Initially the security forces did not remove the dead bodies. They waited for families and relatives to come and collect them so that they could arrest them. However, the families were too frightened to do so and in the end the security forces had to collect the bodies to clean the streets.'' As a retaliation, armed Islamist activists killed the director of Abu Ghraib Prison, Major Hassan al-'Amiri, and several other security officers the following day in an attack on a house close to the mosque, which was used as a temporary headquarters for the security forces.  The Iraqi government denied all reports of unrest which followed the assassination of Ayatollah al-Sadr. However in mid-May 1999 a government official admitted for the first time that disturbances had taken place in Basra claiming that ''some agents who came from behind the border, from Iran, carried out sabotage acts in the city of Basra on March 17 in order to harm Iraq and its people''.(4)  Among those arrested in Basra were several university lecturers. One person A (name withheld) told Amnesty International that he was arrested on 7 June 1999 at night from his home in Basra. He was taken to the General Intelligence prison in Basra and was tortured during interrogation. Methods of torture included extinguishing cigarettes on his feet and beating. He was also made to lie naked on the floor of the prison's concrete courtyard which was unshaded from the heat of the sun. He was then dragged by his arms from one side of the courtyard to another. This left his back, buttocks and thighs bleeding. A was taken to a special courtroom in Basra. There was a judge and several security men in the court. The judge told him that he was guilty of six charges, including criticising the government in his lectures and collecting money to help families of those executed in Basra. A stated that he was innocent. He was then hit by a security officer on the back of his head with a weapon which left his head bleeding. He was taken back to the prison. He was then released on 19 July 1999 after his family had bribed local miliary and security officials. A few other lecturers remain detained until now after they had been tortured. They include Khaled al-'Adeli and 'Abd al-Hussain Hanin, lecturers in Chemistry and Computing, respectively, at Basra University. They are reported to be still detained at the General Intelligence prison in Basra.  During and following these events hundreds of followers of Ayatollah al-Sadr were arrested and were subjected to torture. Dozens were later summarily tried and executed. Among them were Al-Shaikh Salim Jassem Sadkhan al-'Abboudi and al-Shaikh 'Ala' Hussain al-Shuwaili who were reportedly arrested in around June 1999 and were sentenced to death in May 2000 and executed a month later. Both were from Saddam City and their family homes were demolished by the security forces. Others executed during the same period after they had been tortured included al-Sayyid Sa'ad Mohammad 'Ali al-Nouri, Qassim Ghazi al-Shuwaili and al-Sayyid 'Amr al-Mussawi. Al-Shaikh Nazzar Kadhim al-Bahadli, a 29-year-old theology student from Saddam City, was arrested in June 1999 and was tortured for long periods in the building of Saddam Security Directorate. His wife, father and mother were reportedly brought to the building in August 1999 and were tortured in front of him to force him to confess to being one of those responsible for the disturbances in Saddam City. He was said to have confessed in order to spare his parents and his wife any further torture. They were released following his confession but he was sentenced to death later and was executed at the beginning of 2001.  Al-Shaikh Yahya Muhsin Ja'far al-Zeini, from Saddam City, is a 29-year-old former theology student in al-Hawza al-'Ilmiya in al-Najaf. On 2 July 1999 he was arrested in his parents' house following his arrival from al-Najaf. His father and two brothers had been detained as substitute prisoners until his arrest. Security men blindfolded him and took him to the building of Saddam Security Directorate. Once there, he was taken to a room and his blindfold was removed. He told Amnesty International:  '' ... I saw a friend of mine, al-Shaikh Nasser Taresh al-Sa'idi, naked. He was handcuffed and a piece of wood was placed between his elbows and his knees. The two ends of the wood were placed on two high chairs and al-Shaikh Nasser was being suspended like a chicken. This method of torture is known as al-Khaygania (a reference to a former security director known as al-Khaygani). An electric wire was attached to al-Shaikh Nasser's penis and another one attached to one of his toes. He was asked if he could identify me and he said ''this is al-Shaikh Yahya''. They took me to another room and then after about 10 minutes they stripped me of my clothes and a security officer said ''the person you saw has confessed against you''. He said to me ''You followers of [Ayatollah] al-Sadr have carried out acts harmful to the security of the country and have been distributing anti-government statements coming from abroad. He asked if I have any contact with an Iraqi religious scholar based in Iran who has been signing these statements. I said ''I do not have any contacts with him''... I was then left suspended in the same manner as al-Shaikh al-Sa'idi. My face was looking upward. They attached an electric wire on my penis and the other end of the wire is attached to an electric motor. One security man was hitting my feet with a cable. Electric shocks were applied every few minutes and were increased. I must have been suspended for more than an hour. I lost consciousness. They took me to another room and made me walk even though my feet were swollen from beating.... They repeated this method a few times''.  Al-Shaikh Yahya was regularly subjected to electric shocks followed by beating on the feet. For two months he had to sleep on the floor with his hands tied behind his back and his face on the floor. He stated that this was more unbearable than being subjected to electric shocks. On one occasion Shaikh Yahya was suspended from a window for three days. Another method of torture that he described was that while suspended a heavy weight was attached to his genitals and was left hanging for some time. After five months of detention in the building of the Saddam Security Directorate al-Shaikh Yahya and 21 other detainees arrested at the same time were transferred to the Security Directorate of al-Rassafa district, also in Baghdad. He remained held without charge or trial until 14 April 2000 when he was released.  Al-Shaikh Mohammad 'Aziz Rahif al-'Aqqabi, a 27-year-old man married with children, was arrested in the early hours of 14 May 2000 in his house in Saddam City. He was accused of involvement in the murder of the head of Saddam Security Directorate which took place during the disturbances. He was held in Saddam Security Directorate during which he was tortured. In the first 15 days he was held in solitary confinement blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back. The blindfold was removed only during prayers. He stated to Amnesty International:  ''...on the second day of my arrival I was taken to a room for interrogation. The blindfold was removed. The interrogator asked me a lot of questions about people I knew but I said I did not know them. Then he asked the guard to take me to al-Gannara [butcher's] room. Once inside the room the blindfold was removed again and the room was empty. I then had my hands tied with a telephone cable behind my back. I was made to stand on a barrel and then the guards encircled each of my upper arms with a tight belt. The belts had a knob. The knobs were tied to a rope and onto a horizontal rod. The guards then pushed the barrel I was standing on and I was left suspended. One guard then held me from the waist and started to pull me down. This was very painful. The interrogator asked the guard to tie my penis and one of my toes to an electric wire and onto an electric motor. He would then turn the electricity on and would increase it. The interrogator was also beating me with a stick on my back...''.  Al-Shaikh al-'Aqqabi was regularly tortured during the first 15 days of detention. He was made to confront one of his friends who under torture had told the interrogators that Shaikh al-'Aqqabi was involved in the killing of the head of Saddam Security Directorate. Al-Shaikh al-'Aqqabi ''confessed'' to the killing under torture. However the details he gave about the circumstances surrounding the killing convinced the security officers interrogating him that he was not involved. Nevertheless he was kept detained without trial and was tortured further in order to extract from him information about activities of other followers of Ayatollah al-Sadr. He was released on 7 November 2000.  Iyyad Taresh Sajet al-Sa'idi, a 25-year-old former student at Baghdad's Institute of Fine Arts, was arrested together with three of his brothers, Salem, Hamid, Fahd, on 26 June 1999. They were arrested and held in Saddam Security Directorate as substitute prisoners because another brother, al-Shaikh Nasser Taresh Sajet al-Sa'idi was sought by the security authorities. When al-Shaikh Nasser, aged 31 and married with two children, was arrested on 30 June 1999 in al-Najaf where he had been studying theology, and was transferred to Saddam Security Directorate the brothers were not released. They were interrogated in connection with the activities of al-Shaikh Nasser who was a follower of Ayatollah al-Sadr. Each one of them was made to attend the torture of al-Shaikh Nasser. They themselves were tortured separately in front of their brother. Methods of torture included being left suspended and electric shocks being applied on their bodies including their genitals. They were tortured every two or three days during the first three weeks. The three brothers stayed in Saddam Security Directorate until 7 August 1999 when they were transferred to al-Rassafa Security Directorate. On 15 November 1999 they were taken back to Saddam Security Directorate and were released five days later. Following his release Iyyad al-Sa'idi discovered that he had been dismissed from the Institute of Fine Arts. His brother al-Shaikh Nasser was sentenced to death on 13 May 2000. At the beginning of 2001 he was transferred to al-Radhwaniya detention centre where he is reported to be still on death row. No information relating to the exact charges against him or his trial is available to Amnesty International.  3.2 Other suspected political opponents  B (name withheld), a Kurdish businessman from Baghdad, married with children, was arrested in December 1996 outside his house by plainclothes security men. Initially his family did not know his whereabouts and went from one police station to another enquiring about him. Then through friends they found out that he was being held in the headquarters of the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. The family was not allowed to visit him. Eleven months later in November 1997 the family was told by the authorities that he had been executed and that they should go and collect his body. His body reportedly bore evident signs of torture. His eyes were gouged out and the empty eye sockets were filled with paper. His right wrist and left leg were broken. The family was not given any reason for his arrest and subsequent execution. However, they suspected that he was executed because of his friendship with a retired army general who had links with the Iraqi opposition outside the country and who was arrested just before B.'s arrest and was also executed.  Salah Mahdi, a 35-year-old traffic warden in al-Mansur district in Baghdad, married with three children, was arrested together with scores of people following the attempted assassination of 'Uday Saddam Hussain, the eldest son of the President, in December 1996. He was accused of neglect because he did not notice the car the assailants used. He was held in the Special Security building and was severely tortured. He died, reportedly as a result of torture, in around June 1997. His family was told that he had died but the body was never returned to them for burial despite their repeated requests and to date his burial place reportedly remains unknown to the family.  'Abd al-Wahad al-Rifa'i, a 58-year retired teacher, who was executed by hanging after he had been held in prison without charge or trial for more than two years. On 26 March 2001 his family in Baghdad collected his body from the Baghdad Security Headquarters. The body reportedly bore clear marks of torture including the pulling out of toe-nails and swelling on his right eye. 'Abd Wahad al-Rifa'i, married with nine children, was arrested on 8 March 1999. Initially he was held in the headquarters of the General Security Directorate in Baghdad then transferred to the Baghdad Security Headquarters. He was believed to have been arrested because the authorities suspected that he was in contact with the Iraqi opposition abroad through his brother, 'Abd al-Rahim al-Rifa'i, an active anti-government opponent living in Europe. 'Abd al-Wahad al-Rifa'i's wife and children have reportedly had their food ration card withdrawn from them as a punishment and the authorities also stopped pension payments which 'Abd al-Wahad was receiving before his execution.  Hundreds of army and security officers have been arrested in recent years and many have been executed. Charges against them have included plotting to overthrow the government or having contacts with the opposition abroad. Many were subjected to torture. A former Iraqi General Intelligence officer C (name withheld) told Amnesty International that he was arrested in mid-1990s on suspicion of having contacts with the opposition. He was held in solitary confinement for two years at the headquarters of the General Intelligence in al-Hakimiya in Baghdad. During the two years of detention he endured prolonged and repeated torture in the interrogation room. He was left suspended for long hours from a horizontal rod. His hands and feet were tied behind his back and was suspended from the upper arms. He was also beaten with a cable on different parts of the body, especially on the back of his head. Electric shocks were applied to various parts of the body and a wooden stick was inserted into his anus. He was held in solitary confinement all this time. The cell he was held in was painted entirely in red, including the ceiling, the floor and the doors. The light was red too. It is often referred to as the ''red room'' by former torture victims. He was released at the end of 1997. However he was rearrested again two years later also on suspicion of establishing contacts with the opposition and was held in the same detention centre. He was subjected to the same forms of torture as described above. C has now been left with permanent physical damage.  A number of former Iraqi political detainees were forced to undergo surgery to have a leg or arm amputated because they had been tortured for long periods of time and had developed gangrene for which they did not receive medical treatment. They had no choice but to sign statements in hospitals to the effect that it was solely their decision to have the amputation carried out.  4 TORTURE, ILL-TREATMENT AND EXTRAJUDICIAL EXECUTION OF WOMEN  Women too have been tortured, ill-treated and in some cases extrajudicially executed in Iraq. Su'ad Jihad Shams al-Din, a 61-year-old medical doctor, was arrested at her clinic in Baghdad on 29 June 1999 on suspicion that she had contacts with Shi'a Islamist groups. She was detained without charge or trial and was released on 25 July 1999. She was initially held in Baghdad Security Directorate and then was transferred to al-Ambar Security Directorate (also in Baghdad) on 5 July. Su'ad Jihad Shams al-Din was tortured frequently during interrogation by security men. Methods of torture included mostly beatings on the sole (falaqa) with a cable.  Some women have been raped in custody. They were detained and tortured because they were relatives of well known Iraqi opposition activists living abroad. The security authorities use this method to put pressure on Iraqi nationals abroad to cease their activities. For example, on 7 June 2000 Najib al-Salihi, a former army general who fled Iraq in 1995 and joined the Iraqi opposition, was sent a videotape showing the rape of a female relative. Shortly afterwards he reportedly received a telephone call from the Iraqi intelligence service, asking him whether he had received the ''gift'' and informing him that his relative was in their custody.  In October 2000 dozens of women suspected of prostitution were beheaded without any judicial process in Baghdad and other cities after they had been arrested and ill-treated. Men suspected of procurement were also beheaded. The killings were reportedly carried out in the presence of representatives of the Ba'ath Party and the Iraqi Women's General Union. Members of Feda'iyye Saddam, a militia created in 1994 by 'Uday Saddam Hussain, used swords to execute the victims in front of their homes. Some victims were reportedly killed in this manner for political reasons.  Najat Mohammad Haydar, an obstetrician in Baghdad, was beheaded in October 2000 apparently on suspicion of prostitution. However, she was reportedly arrested before the introduction of the policy to behead prostitutes and was said to have been critical of corruption within the health services.  A woman known as ''Um Haydar'' was beheaded reportedly without charge or trial at the end of December 2000. She was 25 years' old and married with three children. Her husband was sought by the security authorities reportedly because of his involvement in Islamist armed activities against the state. He managed to flee the country. Men belonging to Feda'iyye Saddam came to the house in al-Karrada district and found his wife, children and his mother. Um Haydar was taken to the street and two men held her by the arms and a third pulled her head from behind and beheaded her in front of the residents. The beheading was also witnessed by members of the Ba'ath Party in the area. The security men took the body and the head in a plastic bag, and took away the children and the mother-in-law. The body of Um Haydar was later buried in al-Najaf. The fate of the children and the mother-in-law remains unknown.  5 JUDICIAL PUNISHMENTS AMOUNTING TO TORTURE  In 1994 Iraq, through a series of decrees issued by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the highest legislative body in the country, introduced judicial punishments amounting to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments for at least 30 criminal offences, including theft in certain circumstances, monopolizing rationed goods, defaulting or deserting from military service and performing plastic surgery on an amputated arm or leg. The punishments consisted of the amputation of the right hand for a first offence, and of the left foot for a second offence, or the severance of one or both ears. People convicted under these decrees were also branded with an ''X'' mark on the forehead.(5) The Iraqi Government argued that the introduction of these severe punishments were in response to the rising crime rate resulting from worsening economic conditions as a result of the UN imposed sanctions. The punishment of amputation of the auricle of the ears and the branding of the foreheads were suspended in 1996 by the Iraqi Government, through RCC Decree 81/96.  A number of former soldiers who suffered amputation or had their ears cut off have fled the country and now live with permanent physical damage as a result of such punishments. They include:  Ahmad Dakhel Kadhim, aged 30, from al-Samawa in al-Muthanna governorate in southern Iraq, was arrested on 1 September 1994. He had been serving in the army and then deserted following the invasion of Kuwait. He was in hiding until his arrest. He was taken to al-Samawa prison where he was detained for three days and then he was blindfolded and taken to an unknown location. He later found himself in al-Samawa hospital. He was made to lie on a bed and his hands were tied to each side of the bed. He was given an anaesthetic and when he recovered consciousness his right ear had been cut off as a punishment. He was taken back to the same prison and then transferred to other prisons until 23 December 1994, when he managed to escape from prison, and at the beginning of 1995 he fled the country. Ahmad Dakhel Kadhim has been sentenced to death in absentia.  Majed 'Abd al-Wahed al-Sarraji, aged 30 from Baghdad, was arrested on 15 September 1994 because he failed to join the army when he was called to service. He told Amnesty International:  ''I was taken to al-Rashidiya al-Hussainiya Prison in Baghdad. I stayed there for three days without being interrogated. Then on the fourth day they called my name and took me to al-Nu'man Hospital in Baghdad. I was given anaesthetic by injection on my right arm and when I woke up I discovered that they had cut off a small part of my right ear... I was taken back to the same prison where I stayed for 40 days. I found out later that all my family had been forcibly transferred by the security forces to a camp in al-Nahrawan, just outside Baghdad. The camp was surrounded by armed guards. My family was held for three months and were then allowed back to the house. I was transferred to al-Fudhaylia detention centre in Baghdad and six weeks later I was taken to al-Diwaniya Prison, south of Baghdad. I was held in this prison for two years. I was in a room where there were around 50 detainees. All of us in the room had one or both ears cut off partially or completely...''.  Majed 'Abd al-Wahed al-Sarraji managed to escape with a few inmates from al-Diwaniya Prison. He was living in hiding until the beginning of 1999 when he managed to flee the country.  Amputations were very often publicized in Iraqi media, including television and newspapers. However, since the end of 1996, following international condemnation of these punishments, reports of amputations being carried out have rarely been publicized in Iraq. In August 1998 six members of Feda'iyye Saddam reportedly had their hands amputated by order of 'Uday Saddam Hussain. They were said to have been accused of theft and extortion from travellers in the southern city of Basra.  Amputation of the tongue was reportedly approved by the authorities in mid-2000 as a new penalty for slander or abusive remarks about the President or his family. In September 2000 a man reportedly had his tongue amputated by members of Feda'iyye Saddam in Baghdad for slandering the President. He was said to have been driven around after the punishment while information about his alleged offence was broadcast through a loudspeaker.  Amnesty International had publicly called on the Iraqi Government to abolish the penalties of amputation and branding and to provide reparation for all victims, or for families of victims. In November 1997 the UN Human Rights Committee, the international body of experts responsible for supervising the implementation of the ICCPR, examining Iraq's fourth periodic report expressed deep concern that Iraq ''has resorted to the imposition of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, such as amputation and branding, which are incompatible with Article 7 of the Covenant [ICCPR]'' and urged that such punishments be ceased immediately.(6) The Committee recommended that ''a thorough review of existing temporary laws and decrees be undertaken with a view to ensuring their compliance with the provisions of the Covenant''.(7)  6 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Suspected government opponents and occasionally others are systematically and routinely tortured in Iraq. Some of the victims have died and many have been left with permanent physical and psychological damage. Others have been left with mutilated bodies resulting from the application of certain judicial punishments introduced by the government in the 1990s. Amnesty International's concerns about the systematic use of torture and about other gross human rights violations in the country are shared by the UN Commission on Human Rights which, in its 2001 session, condemned the ''widespread, systematic torture and the maintaining of decrees prescribing cruel and inhuman punishment as a penalty for offences''. The Commission called on the government to ''abrogate all decrees that prescribe cruel and inhuman punishment or treatment, including mutilation, and to ensure that torture and cruel punishment and treatment no longer occur''.(8)   Amnesty International is now urging the Iraqi Government to:   1 Ratify and implement fully in domestic law and practice the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;  2 Repeal all decrees introduced in the 1990s which amount to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments;  3 Set up an independent body to undertake prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into all allegations of torture and ill-treatment, including cases of death in custody, and ensure that the methods and findings of such investigations are made public;  4 Bring to justice anyone responsible for committing acts of torture and other serious human rights violations;  5 Issue a public declaration that torture, including rape, will not be tolerated under any circumstances;  6 Ensure that women prisoners are kept separately from men and supervised only by female prison officials;  7 Prohibit by law all extrajudicial executions;  8 Condemn publicly the practice of extrajudicial executions, and make clear to all authorities that such killings will not be tolerated;  9 Demonstrate respect for the inherent right to life by putting an immediate end to executions;  10 Pending the abolition of the death penalty in law for all offences, commute all outstanding death sentences and ensure that it is never applied in violation of Article 6(2)(9) of the ICCPR;  11 Declare a moratorium on executions as called for by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April 1999;(10)  Appendix Amnesty International's 12-Point Program for the Prevention of Torture by Agents of the State  Torture is a fundamental violation of human rights, condemned by the international community as an offence to human dignity and prohibited in all circumstances under international law. Yet torture persists, daily and across the globe. Immediate steps are needed to confront torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment wherever they occur and to eradicate them totally. Amnesty International calls on all governments to implement the following 12-Point Program for the Prevention of Torture by Agents of the State. It invites concerned individuals and organizations to ensure that they do so. Amnesty International believes that the implementation of these measures is a positive indication of a government's commitment to end torture and to work for its eradication worldwide.  1. Condemn torture The highest authorities of every country should demonstrate their total opposition to torture. They should condemn torture unreservedly whenever it occurs. They should make clear to all members of the police, military and other security forces that torture will never be tolerated.  2. Ensure access to prisoners Torture often takes place while prisoners are held incommunicado — unable to contact people outside who could help them or find out what is happening to them. The practice of incommunicado detention should be ended. Governments should ensure that all prisoners are brought before an independent judicial authority without delay after being taken into custody. Prisoners should have access to relatives, lawyers and doctors without delay and regularly thereafter.  3. No secret detention In some countries torture takes place in secret locations, often after the victims are made to ''disappear''. Governments should ensure that prisoners are held only in officially recognized places of detention and that accurate information about their arrest and whereabouts is made available immediately to relatives, lawyers and the courts. Effective judicial remedies should be available at all times to enable relatives and lawyers to find out immediately where a prisoner is held and under what authority and to ensure the prisoner's safety.  4. Provide safeguards during detention and interrogation All prisoners should be immediately informed of their rights. These include the right to lodge complaints about their treatment and to have a judge rule without delay on the lawfulness of their detention. Judges should investigate any evidence of torture and order release if the detention is unlawful. A lawyer should be present during interrogations. Governments should ensure that conditions of detention conform to international standards for the treatment of prisoners and take into account the needs of members of particularly vulnerable groups. The authorities responsible for detention should be separate from those in charge of interrogation. There should be regular, independent, unannounced and unrestricted visits of inspection to all places of detention.  5. Prohibit torture in law Governments should adopt laws for the prohibition and prevention of torture incorporating the main elements of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Convention against Torture) and other relevant international standards. All judicial and administrative corporal punishments should be abolished. The prohibition of torture and the essential safeguards for its prevention must not be suspended under any circumstances, including states of war or other public emergency.  6. Investigate All complaints and reports of torture should be promptly, impartially and effectively investigated by a body independent of the alleged perpetrators. The methods and findings of such investigations should be made public. Officials suspected of committing torture should be suspended from active duty during the investigation. Complainants, witnesses and others at risk should be protected from intimidation and reprisals.  7. Prosecute Those responsible for torture must be brought to justice. This principle should apply wherever alleged torturers happen to be, whatever their nationality or position, regardless of where the crime was committed and the nationality of the victims, and no matter how much time has elapsed since the commission of the crime. Governments must exercise universal jurisdiction over alleged torturers or extradite them, and cooperate with each other in such criminal proceedings. Trials must be fair. An order from a superior officer must never be accepted as a justification for torture.  8. No use of statements extracted under torture Governments should ensure that statements and other evidence obtained through torture may not be invoked in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture.  9. Provide effective training It should be made clear during the training of all officials involved in the custody, interrogation or medical care of prisoners that torture is a criminal act. Officials should be instructed that they have the right and duty to refuse to obey any order to torture.  10. Provide reparation Victims of torture and their dependants should be entitled to obtain prompt reparation from the state including restitution, fair and adequate financial compensation and appropriate medical care and rehabilitation.  11. Ratify international treaties All governments should ratify without reservations international treaties containing safeguards against torture, including the UN Convention against Torture with declarations providing for individual and inter-state complaints. Governments should comply with the recommendations of international bodies and experts on the prevention of torture.  12. Exercise international responsibility Governments should use all available channels to intercede with the governments of countries where torture is reported. They should ensure that transfers of training and equipment for military, security or police use do not facilitate torture. Governments must not forcibly return a person to a country where he or she risks being tortured.  This 12-Point Program was adopted by Amnesty International in October 2000 as a program of measures to prevent the torture and ill-treatment of people who are in governmental custody or otherwise in the hands of agents of the state. Amnesty International holds governments to their international obligations to prevent and punish torture, whether committed by agents of the state or by other individuals. Amnesty International also opposes torture by armed political groups.   ****  (1) In July 1999 Amnesty International issued a public statement explaining the organization's position on sanctions, as well as calling on the UN Security Council to give urgent attention to the humanitarian situation in Iraq and taking all necessary measures to protect the rights of the civilian population.

Amnesty International condemned the killings and urged the government to set up an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. (3) AFP report, 22 February 1999.

This penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court. (10) In its Resolution 1999/61, adopted on 28 April the Commission called on all states which maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions, with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty.

"              1.  Never do anything to prevent another man from getting laid.    This is the foundation for The Code.  Failure to adhere to this Rule results in: a severe beating, public ostracization, and/or temporary or permanent suspension of membership in The Club depending on the gravity of the infraction.  The offended man must serve as judge, jury and executioner and it is not the responsibility of the offended man’s friends to defend his honor.  Please note that women have a similar foundation for their Code and when it is broken the penalties are much more severe!  See Rules #2-6.     2.  Exceptions to Rule #1 are:  he’s after your woman or he wants to fuck another man.   Punishments for infractions of Rule #2 are self-evident.    3.  If another other rule contradicts Rule #1, Rule #1 takes precedence.   After all women are convinced we think only with our dicks and there is no fighting their opinion or genetics, so why pretend otherwise?   4.  Do everything in your power to help another man get laid.   This is also one of the pillars of The Code.  You are required to flirt with her bitchy friend (4 hour limit), loaning of up to $200.00 (one time), letting him use your car or apartment (twice only), and provisioning him with condoms (unlimited).  Again, women have a similar rule, which explains the propensity for matchmaking innate in the female species.   5.  Treat women with respect.   This is the most important rule concerning women and also one of the pillars of the Code.  It is a simple thing, it’s the right thing, and it is essential to your survival in a world dominated by women.  If you are foolish enough to believe women don’t rule the world discontinue reading and turn gay.   6.  Be honest.   Note that I didn’t say don’t ever lie.  As a man, you know that you’re faced with situations that call for a little shading of the truth.  See Rules #7 and #8 for specifics.   7.  Don’t lie for the sake of deception even if it means you don’t get laid.   Be forthright with women.  Rules #5 and #6 demand that you tell them upfront you are not interested in a long-term relationship.  Failure to recognize that women are sexual, sentient beings capable of adult relationships greatly under-estimates the female sex and is indicative that you are still 12 years old and actually do think with your dick.   8.  Don’t cheat.   Men are not cheaters.  You are in no way obligated to lie for another man cheating on his wife or girlfriend when confronted directly and when you have firsthand knowledge that your idiot of a friend is committing such an egregious act.  Men do not cheat at work for profit or promotion.  Men do not cheat at sports or poker.      9.  Keep your word.   There’s an old saying: My word is my bond.  Every man should live by it.  Just think about every time you did not keep your word didn’t you feel like you crap?   10.  Don’t be a bully and stand up for the weak.   There comes a time when toughness, strait-forward brute force, and the defense of principles are necessary.  Men can fight verbally, mentally or physically and never back down for the sake of convenience or fear.   11.  Put family first.   Girlfriends (not wives), jobs and habits come and go, but family is forever.  This includes your mother-in-law.  Call your parents and grandparents often.  A committee comprised of our most esteemed members has not been able to find the right solution as to where to spend Christmas this year.  You’re on your own bud.    12.  Take responsibility for your actions.   Whether you fuck up at work or home, just admit 100% of your screw-up, learn from your mistake and beg forgiveness.    13.  Take a stand for something or you will fall for anything.   A line from a Country song, but oh so true!  Country music is cool – have you seen the women?    14.  Thou shall not rent the movie 'Chocolat'  (fill-in-the-blank for any other such similar “chick flick”).  Self-explanatory.  If you do rent “Chocolat”, return your jock strap and take up interior decorating.   15.  Allowing your wife or girlfriend to sleep with, flirt consistently with, have cyber-sex with or otherwise have a sexually based relationship with another man is indicative that you are incapable of satisfying her.    May I suggest Viagra, Cyalis, Enzyte or a penile implant?     16.  Own, understand and use tools.   It is inconsequential if you know how to work on cars, with electricity or plumbing, or with medal or wood.  You must, however, be capable of safely operating machinery designed to cut-off, injure, burn or otherwise mutilate body parts.  Women dig it and men respect it.       17.  Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.   It’s a little fucking rain – get over it.    18.  Read the books your father read and listen to the music your kids listen to.   These actions keep you in touch with both in the past and the future.  If your kids, however, listen to gangster rap you are authorized to beat them senseless until they understand the beauty of 70’s Rock.    19.  Any man who brings a camera or hidden microphone to a bachelor party may be legally killed and eaten by his fellow partygoers.    There are some things that must remain a mystery to women.    20.  Learn to dance.    Dancing is one of the things women love the most (hence helps you get laid) and must be considered as “sex training” (after all it’s all in the hips).      21.  What another man is doing is nobody’s business.   When you are queried by a buddy's wife, girlfriend, mother, boss, priest, shrink, dentist, accountant, or dog walker, you need not and should not provide any useful information whatsoever as to his whereabouts.  You are permitted to deny his very existence providing he is not cheating and you are confronted directly.    22.  Work out.   It is your obligation to take care of your body – after all it is the support system for your dick.  Women like men with firm butts (don’t ask why!), broad shoulders, strong biceps and flat bellies.  Keeping in shape does not stop when you get married.        23.  Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.   Men are obligated to repay bail loans within 90 days.   24.  You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without recrimination.   Beyond that, anyone within earshot is allowed to call “bullshit”.  Exception: When trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent.  Men are obligated after establishing a relationship with a woman to tell the truth about any exaggeration told in a bar (or any other place) before a proposal for marriage.    25.  There is no such thing as “women’s work” with the exception of suckling a baby.  Men change diapers, clean the floors, use the washer-dryer without assistance or screwing up the whites, can iron silks and do not balk at cleaning the toilets.     26.  If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits forever unless granted specific permission from the man and consent from the father.   Think about it, would you want any of your friends screwing your sister?   27.  Be on time.   The maximum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who is running late is 5 minutes.  For a woman, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.  Moreover, your boss expects it and since he gives you the money you require to get laid………..    28.  Actually have sex in the kitchen, on the dining room table, while in the shower or any other such place your mate thinks is exciting.   All I can say is “Duh” if you don’t.   29.  Remember anniversaries and birthdays.   Again, all I can say is “Duh” if you don’t.   30.  No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man.   In fact, even remembering a male friend’s birthday is strictly optional.   31.  Enjoy what you do for a living.   A great deal of your life revolves around your work.  Enjoy it or find another profession.    32.  Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy’s refrigerator is forbidden.   You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable for consumption.   33.  Be able to tell a good joke.   Every man should have at least five funny unused jokes (preferably dirty) at any given time.  Understand that most women like dirty jokes too and no man should be fearful of using the word pussy in front of women.  Just to make sure – ask first.     34.  Agreeing to distract the less than stunning friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying to hook up with is your legal duty.   Should you get carried away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to speak of it, even at your bachelor party.    35.  Be talented at giving oral sex to women.   First of all, most women have their strongest orgasms when receiving oral sex and hence will actually want to have sex with you more often.  Secondly, it is unreasonable for you to expect her to suck your dick if you’re not willing to eat her pussy.  Please note that both parties must observe personal hygiene – keep the smegma to a minimum, wipe your ass and be open about the need to douche.       36.  Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission and he, in return, is required to grant it.    Listen knucklehead, you gave up on this fine young thing so don’t go off the deep end.  The ex-boyfriend is required to inform the suitor of the reasons he willingly chose to leave or why she dumped him.  It is the obligation of the suitor to find out more than “she’s a psycho bitch who couldn’t fuck to save her life!'   37.  Men watch sports.   Football, and I don’t mean soccer, is the preferred sport of men.  NASCAR racing, boxing, baseball, hockey, and basketball are all acceptable forms of sports television.  Bass fishing, golf, lumberjack competitions, and rodeo events are only acceptable in moderation as they are suitable sports for actually doing but not watching on a consistent basis.  Mens wrestling, gymnastics, swimming, and figure skating are not acceptable except during the Olympics and a USA team is involved.      38.  When stumbling upon other guys watching a sports event, you may always ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.   If you don’t know who the hell is playing and what significance the game has you need to watch SportsCenter more often.  Impersonating Chris Berman is gay.   39.  Women who claim they 'love to watch sports' must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to pick a buffalo wing clean.   Self-explanatory.  Women who can eat more buffalo wings and consume more Jack Daniels than you during a sporting event must be seriously considered as marriage candidates.   40.  The only acceptable position for the toilet seat is down.   Hundreds of millions of man-hours have been wasted arguing this topic.  Just put it up when you pee and put it down when you are done.  End of discussion – let’s all high five, claim victory and get a beer.    41.  If a man’s zipper is down, that's his problem.   You didn't see nothing.    42.  Be known for your character.   Whole volumes could be written on this topic.  This is your business card, the determining factor for women when they are deciding if they want to allow you to sleep with them, and foundation of your reputation as a human being.  See Rule #43.   43.  Live according to a defined set of values.   The U.S. Army has a damn fine list:  Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.  This is known as the LDRSHP Principle.  Defend your values, whatever they may be, to your dying breath.  The defense and adherence to your values determines your character.         44.  Learn to cook.   First of all, man cannot live on fast food alone (I’ve tried).  Secondly, unless you are Bill Gates, it is too damn expensive.  Thirdly, it is unreasonable to expect your woman to cook every meal for you.  Finally, women love men who can layout a fine spread and hence will have sex with you more often.  Cooking involves helping with the dishes regardless of who is the chef.  Please note most of the great chefs in the world are men.  Why many are French is still under study.           45.  The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer and pizza.    Men are obligated to help a buddy move particularly if recently divorced (don’t worry he wont have much left).  If you own a pick-up truck you must volunteer your services before being asked.   46.  Men like dogs – big ones that can hunt and slobber on things.   A single man must never own a cat or initially like his girlfriend's cat.  If, however, you marry a woman who loves cats you must learn to accept the beast as part of the family and give it a proper funeral even if you were “accidentally” involved in its demise.    47.  Plan for your retirement.   No woman wants to be old and broke.  You worked your ass off for 40 years and if you can’t live comfortably in your golden years you are a fucking loser!  Men start putting money away no later than age 25 and don’t count on an inheritance.    48.  Buy cheap cars and expensive houses before the age of 50  (unless you make a shit-load of money and can afford both).  A car loses value the instant you drive off the lot, but your home is your castle and always grows in value.  After the age of 50 it is wise to scale down the house and buy that luxury sedan you’ve always wanted.  Jaguars, BMW’s and Mercedes are cool cars for older men.  Balding old men in convertibles are pathetic.   49.  Have plenty of insurance and know how loans work.   Life, home, medical/dental, personal property and auto insurance is a must.  If the phrase 5 year ARM has you confused you are doomed to financial ruin.     50.  Your girlfriend/wife must bond with your buddy's girlfriends/wives within 30 minutes of meeting them.   You are not required to make nice with her male “friends”.  Low-level sports bonding is all the law requires.  Understand that even her gay male friends want to sleep with your woman deep inside.    51.  Men are not matchmakers.   When your girlfriend/wife expresses a desire to fix her whiny, overweight, bitter friend up with your pal, you may give her the go-ahead only if you'll be able to warn your buddy and give him time prepare excuses about joining the priesthood, being in a committed relationship or gay.      52.  You are what you drink.   Men drink, in precedence, beer, whiskey, scotch, bourbon, gin and vodka.  It is permissible to consume a fruity drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach... and a topless supermodel delivers it... and it's free.  Men do not drink white wine spritzers - ever.  Tequila and schnapps should be reserved for special occasions and every Friday night is not a special occasion.  Men do not drive home drunk – that’s why there are cabs.    53.  Men know how to use a gun.   You are a macho asshole if you take pleasure in killing things, but if you don’t know how to shoot you are a mama’s boy.  Stuffing things you kill is just sick.  Women give men bonus points for knowing how to shoot a cannon, use a tank, or fire a naval gun.  Think about it – big guns that go boom-boom-boom.   54.  Size matters.   If, unfortunately, The Lord has not endowed you with His Blessings then learn how to give a woman really good head.     55.  Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.   Need I say more?    56.  Read the Bible.   The Code and the general life of men necessitates breaking some of the 10 Commandments.  If you do not understand absolution, you will be damned to Hell (defined as getting butt fucked for Eternity by 15-inch dicks made of near-molten steel).    57.  A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight for her, get an erection and have sex when they come home.   Self-explanatory.  Otherwise said hot babe is fair game.    58.  Do not abuse homosexuals.   Remember just because they are fools there are more women for us!  If your mate has a female friend who is a lesbian do not encourage a ménage a trios – you may end up getting more than you bargained for.  Women kiss better than men and it is impossible to compete with a vibrator.       59.  If a buddy is outnumbered, out manned, or too drunk to fight, you must jump into the fight.    Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have caused you to think, 'What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin', then you may sit back and enjoy.    60.  Get over being bald.   You’re bald because you have too much testosterone in your system (TV commercials confirm this scientific fact), so get over it.  There are a significant number of women who think bald men are sexy.  Attempting to hold on to your youth in desperation by combing your side hair over is pathetic.  So is wasting money on transplants and miracle cures.      61.  Locker Room/Gym etiquette must be observed.   Phrases that may not be uttered to another man while weight lifting: 'Yeah, baby, push it!', 'C'mon, give me one more!  Harder!, 'Another set and we can hit the showers.', and 'Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?”.  A minimum of one showerhead separation is required and never check out another man’s goods.        62.  Men are simple.   The world is black or white, good or evil, and right or wrong.  This is not to say that men are incapable of complex thought and see interconnected relationships.  We do it all the time, but don’t let minutia get in the way of making a clear decision.  After all, Einstein was a man.  Side note:  it has been confirmed that Einstein’s tongue and not his brain was the reason Marilyn Monroe found him so sexy.         63.  Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but not both.  That's just plain greedy.    64.  Listen – really listen.   This is the biggest mistake men make when talking to women.  I know you don’t give a shit about how well the shoes complement her favorite dress, but if you blow her off you will be discussing accessories for hours.  This is closely related to Rule # 5.   65.  If you compliment a guy on his six-pack, you better be referring to his beer.   Same thinking goes for compliments on his “buns”.  Self-explanatory.     66.  Your parents get proportionally smarter as you get older.   Men are required to send their parents to an all-expense paid vacation to Hawaii for all the shit they caused their parents while a teenager.   67.  Never join your girlfriend/wife in dissing a buddy.   This is very dangerous territory for most men.  Sometimes you got to subjugate your need to get your Willy wet to honor the Code.   68.  Let her use the remote control.   Most men have an unhealthy fixation with the remote similar to that of a 13-year-old boy who recently discovered masturbation and how to unscramble the dirty movie channel.   69.  There are lots of good TV shows besides sports.   The History Channel, the Nature Channel, PBS, The Discovery Channel, and the Comedy Channel are places to find common ground when she is operating the remote.  A word on television – don’t watch too much.  Your social life with your mate should not consist of vegging on the couch night after night endlessly flipping through channels in the vain hope of finding something you both can agree upon.  If it is then expect to hear about it - often.  Men do not watch soaps, Oprah or Dr. Phil.       70.  Bringing reading material to the bathroom is just plain wrong.   Get in, do your business, and get out.  And for God’s Sake turn on the fan.      71.  Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing :  either you are both urinating (look strait forward) or both waiting in line (look away from other men urinating).  In all other situations, a nod is all the conversation you need.  Urinal spacing is also important – never purposely stand next another man when there are plenty of others to use.     72.  If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not join him.   Exception occurs when you are in the back seat of a squad car after being picked up for public urination and the cops have Led Zeppelin cranked.  You’re fucked so you might as well enjoy the ride.     73.  Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt one intervention.   If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye and deliver a 'Fuck Off!' you are absolved of your responsibility.   74.  Women like men in uniform.   Military, policemen, firemen, and doctors all enjoy the bonuses of wearing a uniform.  If these professions are not for you, then get a uniform for special occasions and why you’re at it get her a nurse uniform (trust me on this one).   75.  Be inventive in bed.   Hey the two-minute missionary drill on a twice-monthly basis is unacceptable.  Get creative and openly discuss techniques/options with your mate.  Let her get on top (much more pleasurable for women than the missionary position), dominate from behind (doggy style), and be willing to incorporate vocalizations, light bondage, blindfolds, foods and “devices”.  Sexual decisions must be made mutually.     76.  Date your mate.   Take her out regularly like you did when you were in hot pursuit.  Treat her like you did when you first met all the time.  Open doors, pull out her chair and use table manners.  You must take your wife out at least monthly to a place she actually wants to go.  Also related to Rule #5.     77.  Learn to give a good massage.   Is there anything better than rubbing oils over your mate’s naked body?  Besides giving a good massage leads to increased frequency of sex and is indicative of your ability to use your hand tools.     78.  Don’t put your woman on a pedestal.   It’s uncomfortable and after 40 her butt will likely be too big to fit on it anyway.  Seriously, this is not fair to her and you will always end up disappointed, abused and manipulated.   79.  Be a cultured human being.   Learn about the world’s cultures and customs.  Bonus points for learning a foreign language (do you know that the US is the only civilized country where multiple languages aren’t regularly taught to the young?).  Most couples get stale because the man’s idea of culture is going to Red Lobster.           80.  Fear of commitment is mans greatest weakness.   Yeah I know there are plenty fish in the sea, blah, blah, blah………  Listen knucklehead, if you want to fuck her then you must be willing to commit to her.  The consequences of being the Lone Wolf on the prowl are masturbation and loneliness.     81.  Men Ride Harley’s not Japanese Crotch Rockets.   If you don’t get this, start over at Rule # 1 and read slowly.    82.  There are definitive periods for wallowing in self-pity after getting dumped.   Anything less than 3 months = one hour.  3 to 6 months = one day.  6 months to 2 years = one week.  Over two years = one month.  After that it is the duty of all a man’s friends to kick him in the ass, get him drunk and take him to the nudie bar.  Men who go to women for advise on how to recover from being dumped are still suckling on the teat and should be shot.    83.  Long distance relationships never work.   Listen here Long Dong Silver your dick ain’t that big nor is your will that strong.  One or the other of you will stray from the relationship.  Better to cut it off early than to prolong its certain death.  You can begin a relationship over long distances (internet romances), but you must be prepared to travel often.  If she is the right girl a time will come when you can be together full-time.     84.  Never break up with a woman and have her hate you.   Just because things didn’t work out doesn’t mean you need to be an asshole.  Not only is this related to Rule #5 but you must understand that every other woman who sees you two break up is watching you very closely and the women’s chat network is very strong.  Since your future sex life depends on finding another woman be a gentleman.      85.  Know and follow Clint Eastwood’s 10 Rules.   1.  Call your own shots.  2.  Be fearless.  3.  Keep moving.  4.  Love your job.  5.  Speak softly.  6.  Don't be predictable.  7.  Find a good woman.  8.  Learn to play the piano (not so sure about that one, but hey it’s Clint).  9.  You are what you drive.  10.  Avoid extreme makeovers.   86.  If you get lost ask for directions.   Again the man-hours wasted arguing over men’s innate sense of direction are in the hundreds of millions.  That said, remember Christopher Columbus was lost and managed to find something pretty damn cool.    87.  Never look in the rear view mirror.   I’m not talking about when driving you idiot, but about life.  What was, was.  You can’t change it and you can’t go back.   88.  Be faithful.   This is very difficult because it is contrary to nature.  Understand 95% of the species in the world do not have monogamous relationships and that 60% of married women have an affair at some time in their lives.      89.  Stuff doesn’t make you happy, only you can.   I know plenty of very unhappy rich bastards.  Happiness is found within and is shared with those you love.  Yep, I know, but we all got both X and Y-chromosomes.  Got problems with that take it up the Big Man upstairs.    90.  Solve your own problems.   If you are expecting the world to treat you fairly, make right again what once went wrong, and hand you the winning lottery ticket you are a fool.     91.  Don’t be a complainer.   Women bitch, discuss, and then solve problems.  Men solve problems then discuss how they should have solved the problem.   92.  If owed an apology stand your ground.   Forgiveness is mandatory but the offending person, regardless of sex, is required to meaningfully ask for it.  If offended in a public forum a public apology is required.   93.  Be persistent.   Your success in life depends solely on how much you work at it.  Give up easily, fail to give 100%, and not staying the course results in mediocrity.  No true man settles for being average.  If you get bucked off the bronco, dust yourself off and get back on for the ride of your life.  Gold belt buckles come in endless forms.   94.  Don’t do drugs or be a drunk.   Firstly, it’s stupid.  Secondly, it’s expensive.  Thirdly, it kills you.  Fourthly, and most importantly, it decreases your sexual performance.    95.  Listen to your inner voice.   Every time you are about to screw-up, make the wrong decision, take the easy way out, or put the keys in the ignition after too many drinks a little voice goes off in your head.  This is God’s way of telling you to stop and think.  It takes years of training to listen to your inner voice.  Sometimes the message isn’t clear or loud so you must train to listen.          96.  Travel.   Traveling does not consist of going to your parents house every Christmas.  See the Grand Canyon, go to Paris and Rome, and bask in the Caribbean sun.       97.  Invest in your kids and relationship.   Failure to sit down with your daughter and help her with her math homework, teach your son to throw a baseball, and do things she likes to do results in regret later in life.  When your kids are born start a college fund.        98.  Take risk.   I’ve learned more from the mistakes I’ve made because I was willing to stick my neck out than I ever did by playing it safe.  When you take risk the rewards are always great.  Taking risk doesn’t mean being bold – boldness alone gets you killed.  I’ve been to three combat zones and have seen good men die because they were bold, and trust me their deaths weren’t necessary, heroic or pretty.     99.  Be able to drive a stick shift.    To be a man you don’t have to own a 5-speed Ferrari, but being able to get behind the wheel of any car with a manual transmission is.     100.  Don’t quibble over the check.   Tallying-up who had desert and the extra cup of coffee is pointless.  Here’s how it works whether you are with another couple or a bunch of friends: split it evenly.  The only acceptable reason to ask for separate checks is when you are on business and must present meals claims.  No splitting the check on a date!   101.  Be Generous.   This has to do with Rule #100 (tip at least 15% no matter where you eat) and so much more.  You work hard for one reason:  to share your wealth.  Generosity is more than spreading a few dollars around.  Allow people to make mistakes, open your mind to new ideas, and give of yourself.    102.  Always use “Miss” and never use “Ma’am”.   My mother taught me this one and boy am I glad she did.  The 10000’s of smiles and brightened eyes I have received from observing this simple rule have made my life better.  No woman wants to be called ma’am because it makes her feel old.  I know ma’am is big in the South and with the military, but cultural lines are disappearing and ma’am is increasingly unacceptable.      103.  Buy flowers for no reason often.   It is easy to buy her flowers on her birthday or your anniversary, but if you want her to know how much you really love her bring home a couple dozen long-stemmed red roses on a Tuesday night.   104.  She is always the most important person in the room.   Whether she spent hours getting ready for the gala ball or is dressed in jeans and a t-shirt at the barbeque she is the most beautiful creature on the planet – after all she came in with you!  During the course of the evening you two are going to drift away (don’t be like Saran wrap), but catch her eye from time to time, give her a wink and a smile to let her know you are thinking of her – and you are watching her flirting with the cute younger man!   105.  Diamonds.   Enough said?   106.  Learn from John Wayne.   Despite having the real first name of Marion, the Duke became the icon for all that is male.  He epitomized the cowboy, the soldier, the cop and every man because he showed what a single man can do if he is determined regardless of the forces against him.  The Duke was not some macho braggart – he backed up his words with action and, more importantly, with compassion.       107.Back hair.   Again, enough said?    108.  Be a sharp dressed man.   ZZ Top got it right otherwise a bunch of scruffy guitar pickers from Texas wouldn’t have such a bevy of beautiful women who love their music and want to be in their videos.  Get a good suit, shine your shoes, and be neatly groomed.  Have you ever noticed those old men who seem to have their own unique style (even if it looks ridiculous to you) have the old women beam in their presence?  Find your style!  Men dress themselves and buy their own clothes.   109.  Tattoos and earrings should be limited to a select few.   If you are a biker they are an absolute must, but if you work in an office shuffling papers the earring doesn’t make you look like Fabio.  Come to think of it – does any man really want to look like Fabio?     110.  Let her have whatever side of the bed she wants.   This is another one men have wasted a lot of time on.  The only side of the bed I care about is the middle when I’m naked, having sex with my mate, and I’m on the bottom because I need the rest!   111.  Lead - don’t follow.   This is a very old truism.  If there is a problem to be solved, a decision to be made, a challenge to be overcome be in front.  Being a sheep or lemming in the background criticizing the action is like being a eunuch in a harem – you don’t have the tools to do anything so just shut-up.  Now it is impossible to lead everything – if you try you are a micro-managing asshole – so it is imperative you know how to lead and be part of the team.  In my business, being a solider, being a leader comes naturally to many and is instilled in all of our training, but being a team player is just as important.   112.  Be a gentlemen.   Whether you are with your mate at home or out in public observe simple rules of etiquette:  give her your arm when walking down the street, hold her hand in public, hold the door open for strangers, and walk with her not in front of her.  Say please and thank you.  Recognize the cab driver as a human being.  Say hello to the tollbooth operator.  You get the idea – be a human.   113.  Have a firm handshake and look people in the eye.   This is old business adage, but it applies to life as well.  A lack of either indicates you have a weak mind and low self esteem.   114.  Observe Colin Powell’s Rules.   1.  It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.  2.  Get mad, then get over it.  3.  Avoid having your ego so close to your position that, when your position falls, your ego goes with it.  4.  It can be done!  5.  Be careful what you choose, you may get it. 6.  Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision. 7.  You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours. 8.  Check small things.  9.  Share credit.  10.  Remain calm. Be kind.  11.  Have a vision. Be demanding.  12.  Don't take counsel of your fears or nay Sayers.  13.  Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.   115.  Don’t be afraid to piss people off.   Try to placate everyone and no one will be happy.  More importantly, you will stifle the best and brightest around you.  Take “outrageous” stands, expect people to do the impossible, and demand high standards of performance – you will be surprised at the success you will achieve.  This Code pissed off some of my dearest female friends – why I’m not sure as it is intended to be humorous and insightful, but I sleep very well at night living this Code everyday.  At least I know who I am, have nothing to hide from, and have no reason to be ashamed for “being in touch with myself” – even the darker sides.               116.  Find your own Code to live by.   Hey these are just the thoughts of one man.  Find your own rules and live by them.  If you come across one that would be beneficial to other men please share them.  We are in this together and it is our duty to do anything to help another man get laid – what you forgot Rules #1 and #4 already?    117.  Take the hard right over the easy wrong.   This is the final pillar of the Code.  I put it near the bottom not because it isn’t important, but because I want you to remember it.  Everything you do and say tells others who you really are.  People are not stupid.  When you take the easy way out, fail to stand up for your values, show less than honorable character, take advantage of the weak, fail to be honest or cheat we all see it.  We may still be your friends but we will always think less of you.    118.  Share the Code with Women.   I know many of you are saying this is sacrosanct stuff and moreover you have surely offended some.  How can we give out our best secrets to women or risk the wrath of half the planet’s occupants?  Listen, men have nothing to hide.  We are who and what we are.  Go back over the Code as see if there is anything in it that every woman doesn’t already know about us.  Sure, women are a mystery.  Men will never understand the Women’s Code.  They should remain a wondrous mystery otherwise life would be boring as hell!

"        TO KILL OR NOT TO KILL  by SCOTT TUROW Coming to terms with capital punishment.  The New Yorker, Issue of 2003-01-06 Posted 2002-12-30  When Joseph Hartzler, a former colleague of mine in the United States attorney's office in Chicago, was appointed the lead prosecutor in the trial of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, he remarked that McVeigh was headed for Hell, no matter what. His job, Hartzler said, was simply to speed up the delivery. That was also the attitude evinced by the prosecutors vying to be first to try the two Beltway sniper suspects. Given the fear and fury the multiple shootings inspired, it wasn't surprising that polls showed that Americans favored imposing what Attorney General Ashcroft referred to as the 'ultimate sanction.' Yet despite the retributive wrath that the public seems quick to visit on particular crimes, or criminals, there has also been, in recent years, growing skepticism about the death-penalty system in general. A significant number of Americans question both the system's over-all fairness and, given the many cases in which DNA evidence has proved that the wrong person was convicted of a crime, its ability to distinguish the innocent from the guilty.  Ambivalence about the death penalty is an American tradition.When the Republic was founded, all the states, following English law, imposed capital punishment. But the humanistic impulses that favored democracy led to questions about whether the state should have the right to kill the citizens upon whose consent government was erected. Jefferson was among the earliest advocates of restricting executions. In 1846, Michigan became the first American state to outlaw capital punishment, except in the case of treason, and public opinion has continued to vacillate on the issue. Following the Second World War and the rise and fall of a number of totalitarian governments, Western European nations began abandoning capital punishment, but their example is of limited relevance to us, since our murder rate is roughly four times the rate in Europe. One need only glance at a TV screen to realize that murder remains an American preoccupation, and the concomitant questions of how to deal with it challenge contending strains in our moral thought, pitting Old Testament against New, retribution against forgiveness.  I was forced to confront my own feelings about the death penalty as one of fourteen members of a commission appointed by Governor George Ryan of Illinois to recommend reforms of the state's capital-punishment system. In the past twenty-five years, thirteen men who spent time on death row in Illinois have been exonerated, three of them in 1999. Governor Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in January, 2000, and five weeks later announced the formation of our commission. We were a diverse group: two sitting prosecutors; two sitting public defenders; a former Chief Judge of the Federal District Court; a former U.S. senator; three women; four members of racial minorities; prominent Democrats and Republicans. Twelve of us were lawyers, nine with experience as defense attorneys and elevenincluding William Martin, who won a capital conviction against the mass murderer Richard Speck, in 1967with prosecutorial backgrounds. Roberto Ramrez, a Mexican-American immigrant who built a successful janitorial business, knew violent death at first hand. His father was murdered, and his grandfather shot and killed the murderer. Governor Ryan gave us only one instruction. We were to determine what reforms, if any, would make application of the death penalty in Illinois fair, just, and accurate. In March, 2000, during the press conference at which members of the commission were introduced, we were asked who among us opposed capital punishment. Four people raised their hands. I was not one of them.    For a long time, I referred to myself as a death-penalty agnostic, although in the early seventies, when I was a student, I was reflexively against capital punishment. When I was an assistant U.S. attorney, from 1978 to 1986, there was no federal death penalty. The Supreme Court declared capital-punishment statutes unconstitutional in 1972, and although the Court changed its mind in 1976, the death penalty did not become part of federal law again until 1988. However, Illinois had reinstated capital punishment in the mid-seventies, and occasionally my colleagues became involved in state-court murder prosecutions. In 1984, when my oldest friend in the office, Jeremy Margolis, secured a capital sentence against a two-time murderer named Hector Reuben Sanchez, I congratulated him. I wasn't sure what I might do as a legislator, but I had come to accept that some people are incorrigibly evil and I knew that I could follow the will of the community in dealing with them, just as I routinely accepted the wisdom of the RICO statute and the mail-fraud and extortion laws it was my job to enforce.  My first direct encounter with a capital prosecution came in 1991. I was in private practice by then and had published two successful novels, which allowed me to donate much of my time as a lawyer to pro-bono work. One of the cases I was asked to take on was the appeal of Alejandro (Alex) Hernandez, who had been convicted of a notorious kidnapping, rape, and murder. In February, 1983, a ten-year-old girl, Jeanine Nicarico, was abducted from her home in a suburb of Chicago, in DuPage County. Two days later, Jeanine's corpse, clad only in a nightshirt, was found by hikers in a nearby nature preserve. She had been blindfolded, sexually assaulted several times, and then killed by repeated blows to the head. More than forty law-enforcement officers formed a task force to hunt down the killer, but by early 1984 the case had not been solved, and a heated primary campaign was under way for the job of state's attorney in DuPage County. A few days before the election, three menAlex Hernandez, Rolando Cruz, and Stephen Buckleywere indicted.  The incumbent lost the election anyway, to a local lawyer, Jim Ryan, who took the case to trial in January, 1985. (Ryan later became the attorney general of Illinois, a position he is about to relinquish.) The jury deadlocked on Buckley, but both Hernandez and Cruz were convicted and sentenced to death. There was no physical evidence against either of themno blood, semen, fingerprints, or other forensic proof. The state's case consisted solely of each defendant's statements, a contradictory maze of mutual accusations and demonstrable falsehoods. By the time the case reached me, seven years after the men were arrested, the charges against Buckley had been dropped and the Illinois Supreme Court had reversed the original convictions of Hernandez and Cruz and ordered separate retrials. In 1990, Cruz was condemned to death for a second time. Hernandez's second trial ended with a hung jury, but at a third trial, in 1991, he was convicted and sentenced to eighty years in prison.  Hernandez's attorneys made a straightforward pitch to me: their client, who has an I.Q. of about 75, was innocent. I didn't believe it. And, even if it was true, I couldn't envision persuading a court to overturn the conviction a second time. Illinois elects its state-court judges, and this was a celebrated case: 'the case that broke Chicago's heart' was how it was sometimes referred to in the press. Nevertheless, I read the brief that Lawrence Marshall, a professor of law at Northwestern University, had filed in behalf of Cruz, and studied the transcripts of Hernandez's trials. After that, there was no question in my mind. Alex Hernandez was innocent.  In June, 1985, another little girl, Melissa Ackerman, had been abducted and murdered in northern Illinois. Like Jeanine Nicarico, she was kidnapped in broad daylight, sexually violated, and killed in a wooded area. A man named Brian Dugan was arrested for the Ackerman murder, and, in the course of negotiating for a life sentence, he admitted that he had raped and killed Jeanine Nicarico as well.  The Illinois State Police investigated Dugan's admissions about the Nicarico murder and accumulated a mass of corroborating detail. Dugan was not at work the day the girl disappeared, and a church secretary, working a few blocks from the Nicarico home, recalled a conversation with him. A tire print found where Jeanine's body was deposited matched the tires that had been on Dugan's car. He knew many details about the crime that had never been publicly revealed, including information about the interior of the Nicarico home and the blindfold applied to Jeanine.  Nevertheless, the DuPage County prosecutors refused to accept Dugan's confession. Even after Cruz's and Hernandez's second convictions were overturned in the separate appeals that Larry Marshall and I argued, and notwithstanding a series of DNA tests that excluded Cruz and Hernandez as Jeanine Nicarico's sexual assailant, while pointing directly at Dugan, the prosecutors pursued the cases. It was only after Cruz was acquitted in a third trial, late in 1995, that both men were finally freed.    Capital punishment is supposed to be applied only to the most heinous crimes, but it is precisely those cases which, because of the strong feelings of repugnance they evoke, most thoroughly challenge the detached judgment of all participants in the legal processpolice, prosecutors, judges, and juries. The innocent are often particularly at risk. Most defendants charged with capital crimes avoid the death penalty by reaching a plea bargain, a process that someone who is innocent is naturally reluctant to submit to. Innocent people tend to insist on a trial, and when they get it the jury does not include anyone who will refuse on principle to impose a death sentence. Such people are barred from juries in capital cases by a Supreme Court decision, Witherspoon v. Illinois, that, some scholars believe, makes the juries more conviction-prone. In Alex Hernandez's third trial, the evidence against him was so scant that the DuPage County state's attorney's office sought an outside legal opinion to determine whether it could get the case over the bare legal threshold required to go to a jury. Hernandez was convicted anyway, although the trial judge refused to impose a death sentence, because of the paucity of evidence.  A frightened public demanding results in the aftermath of a ghastly crime also places predictable pressures on prosecutors and police, which can sometimes lead to questionable conduct. Confronted with the evidence of Brian Dugan's guilt, the prosecutors in Hernandez's second trial had tried to suggest that he and Dugan could have committed the crime together, even though there was no proof that the men knew each other. Throughout the state's case, the prosecutors emphasized a pair of shoe prints found behind the Nicarico home, where a would-be burglari.e., Hernandezcould have looked through a window. Following testimony that Hernandez's shoe size was about 7, a police expert testified that the shoe prints were 'about size 6.' Until he was directly cross-examined, the expert did not mention that he was referring to a woman's size 6, or that he had identified the tread on one of the prints as coming from a woman's shoe, a fact he'd shared with the prosecutor, who somehow failed to inform the defense.  This kind of overreaching by the prosecution occurred frequently. A special grand jury was convened after Cruz and Hernandez were freed. Three former prosecutors and four DuPage County police officers were indicted on various counts, including conspiring to obstruct justice. They were tried andas is often the case when lawenforcement officers are charged with overzealous execution of their dutiesacquitted, although the county subsequently reached a multimillion-dollar settlement in a civil suit brought by Hernandez, Cruz, and their onetime co-defendant, Stephen Buckley. Despite assertions by DuPage County prosecutors that Jeanine Nicarico's killer deserves to die, Brian Dugan has never been charged with her murder, although Joseph Birkett, the state's attorney for the county, admitted in November that new DNA tests prove Dugan's role with 'scientific certainty.' In the past, Birkett had celebrated the acquittal of his colleagues on charges of conspiring to obstruct justice and had attacked the special prosecutor who'd brought the charges. He continues to make public statements suggesting that Cruz and Hernandez might be guilty. An ultimately unsuccessful attempt was made to demote the judge who acquitted Cruz, and last year, when the judge resigned from the bench, he had to pay for his own going-away party. In the meantime, the prosecutor who tried to incriminate Alex Hernandez with the print from a woman's shoe is now Chief Judge in DuPage County.    If these are the perils of the system, why have a death penalty? Many people would answer that executions deter others from committing murder, but I found no evidence that convinced me. For example, Illinois, which has a death penalty, has a higher murder rate than the neighboring state of Michigan, which has no capital punishment but roughly the same racial makeup, income levels, and population distribution between cities and rural areas. In fact, in the last decade the murder rate in states without the death penalty has remained consistently lower than in the states that have had executions. Surveys of criminologists and police chiefs show that substantial majorities of both groups doubt that the death penalty significantly reduces the number of homicides.  Another argumentthat the death penalty saves money, because it avoids the expense of lifetime incarcerationdoesn't hold up, either, when you factor in the staggering costs of capital litigation. In the United States in 2000, the average period between conviction and execution was eleven and a half years, with lawyers and courts spewing out briefs and decisions all that time.  The case for capital punishment that seemed strongest to me came from the people who claim the most direct benefit from an execution: the families and friends of murder victims. The commission heard from survivors in public hearings and in private sessions, and I learned a great deal in these meetings. Death brought on by a random element like disease or a tornado is easier for survivors to accept than the loss of a loved one through the conscious will of another human being. It was not clear to me at first what survivors hoped to gain from the death of a murderer, but certain themes emerged. Dora Larson has been a victims'-rights advocate for nearly twenty years. In 1979, her ten-year-old daughter was kidnapped, raped, and strangled by a fifteen-year-old boy who then buried her in a grave he had dug three days earlier. 'Our biggest fear is that someday our child's or loved one's killer will be released,' she told the commission. 'We want these people off the streets so that others might be safe.' A sentence of life without parole should guarantee that the defendant would never repeat his crime, but Mrs. Larson pointed out several ways in which a life sentence poses a far greater emotional burden than an execution. Because her daughter's killer was under eighteen, he was ineligible for the death penalty. 'When I was told life, I thought it was life,' Larson said to us. 'Then I get a letter saying our killer has petitioned the governor for release.'  Victims' families talk a lot about 'closure,' an end to the legal process that will allow them to come to final terms with their grief. Mrs. Larson and others told us that families frequently find the execution of their lost loved one's killer a meaningful emotional landmark. A number of family members of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing expressed those sentiments after they watched Timothy McVeigh die. The justice the survivors seek is the one embedded in the concept of restitution: the criminal ought not to end up better off than his victim. But the national victims'-rights movement is so powerful that victims have become virtual proprietors of the capital system, leading to troubling inconsistencies. For instance, DuPage County has long supported the Nicarico family's adamant wish for a death sentence for Jeanine's killer, but the virtually identical murder of Melissa Ackerman resulted in a life term with no possibility of parole for Brian Dugan, because Melissa's parents preferred a quick resolution. It makes no more sense to let victims rule the capital process than it would to decide what will be built on the World Trade Center site solely according to the desires of the survivors of those killed on September 11th. In a democracy, no minority, even people whose losses scour our hearts, should be entitled to speak for us all.    Governor Ryan's commission didn't spend much time on philosophical debates, but those who favored capital punishment tended to make one argument again and again: sometimes a crime is so horrible that killing its perpetrator is the only just response. I've always thought death-penalty proponents have a point when they say that it denigrates the profound indignity of murder to punish it in the same fashion as other crimes. These days, you can get life in California for your third felony, even if it's swiping a few videotapes from a Kmart. Does it vindicate our shared values if the most immoral act imaginable, the unjustified killing of another human being, is treated the same way? The issue is not revenge or retribution, exactly, so much as moral order. When everything is said and done, I suspect that this notion of moral proportionultimate punishment for ultimate evilis the reason most Americans continue to support capital punishment.  This places an enormous burden of precision on the justice system, however. If we execute the innocent or the undeserving, then we have undermined, not reinforced, our sense of moral proportion. The prosecution of Alex Hernandez demonstrated to me the risks to the innocent. A case I took on later gave me experience with the problematic nature of who among the guilty gets selected for execution. One afternoon, I had assembled a group of young lawyers in my office to discuss pro-bono death-penalty work when, by pure coincidence, I found a letter in my in-box from a man, Christopher Thomas, who said he'd been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death, even though none of the four eyewitnesses to the crime who testified had identified him. We investigated and found that the letter was accuratein a sense. None of the eyewitnesses had identified Thomas. However, he had two accomplices, both of whom had turned against him, and Thomas had subsequently confessed three different times, the last occasion on videotape.  According to the various accounts, Chris Thomaswho is black, and was twenty-one at the time of the crimeand his two pals had run out of gas behind a strip mall in Waukegan, Illinois. They were all stoned, and they hatched a plan to roll somebody for money. Rafael Gasgonia, a thirty-nine-year-old Filipino immigrant, was unfortunate enough to step out for a smoke behind the photo shop where he worked as a delivery driver. The three men accosted him. Thomas pointed a gun at his head, and when a struggle broke out Thomas fired once, killing Gasgonia instantly.  I was drawn to Chris Thomas's case because I couldn't understand how a parking-lot stickup gone bad had ended in a death sentence. But after we studied the record, it seemed clear to us that Thomas, like a lot of other defendants, was on death row essentially for the crime of having the wrong lawyers. He had been defended by two attorneys under contract to the Lake County public defender's office. They were each paid thirty thousand dollars a year to defend a hundred and three cases, about three hundred dollars per case. By contract, one assignment had to be a capital case. The fiscal year was nearly over, and neither of the contract lawyers had done his capital work, so they were assigned to Thomas's case together. One of them had no experience of any kind in death-penalty cases; the other had once been standby counsel for a man who was defending himself.  In court, we characterized Thomas's defense as all you would expect for six hundred dollars. His lawyers seemed to regard the case as a clear loser at trial and, given the impulsive nature of the crime, virtually certain to result in a sentence other than death. They did a scanty investigation of Thomas's background for the sentencing hearing, an effort that was hindered by the fact that the chief mitigation witness, Thomas's aunt, who was the closest thing to an enduring parental figure in his life, had herself been prosecuted on a drug charge by one of the lawyers during his years as an assistant state's attorney. As a result, Thomas's aunt distrusted the lawyers, and, under her influence, Chris soon did as well. He felt screwed around already, since he had confessed to the crime and expressed remorse, and had been rewarded by being put on trial for his life. At the sentencing hearing, Thomas took the stand and denied that he was guilty, notwithstanding his many prior confessions. The presiding judge, who had never before sentenced anybody to death, gave Thomas the death penalty.  In Illinois, some of this could not happen now. The Capital Litigation Trust Fund has been established to pay for an adequate defense, and the state Supreme Court created a Capital Litigation trial bar, which requires lawyers who represent someone facing the death penalty to be experienced in capital cases. Nonetheless, looking over the opinions in the roughly two hundred and seventy capital appeals in Illinois, I was struck again and again by the wide variation in the seriousness of the crimes. There were many monstrous offenses, but also a number of garden-variety murders. And the feeling that the system is an unguided ship is only heightened when one examines the first-degree homicides that have resulted in sentences other than death. Thomas was on death row, but others from Lake Countya man who had knocked a friend unconscious and placed him on the tracks in front of an oncoming train, for instance, and a mother who had fed acid to her babyhad escaped it.  The inevitable disparities between individual cases are often enhanced by social factors, like race, which plays a role that is not always well understood. The commission authorized a study that showed that in Illinois, you are more likely to receive the death penalty if you are whitetwo and a half times as likely. One possible reason is that in a racially divided society whites tend to associate with, and thus to murder, other whites. And choosing a white victim makes a murderer three and a half times as likely to be punished by a death sentence as if he'd killed someone who was black. (At least in Illinois, blacks and whites who murdered whites were given a death sentence at essentially the same rate, which has not always been true in other places.)  Geography also matters in Illinois. You are five times as likely to get a death sentence for first-degree murder in a rural area as you are in Cook County, which includes Chicago. Gender seems to count, too. Capital punishment for slaying a woman is imposed at three and half times the rate for murdering a man. When you add in all the uncontrollable variableswho the prosecutor and the defense lawyer are, the nature of the judge and the jury, the characteristics of the victim, the place of the crimethe results reflect anything but a clearly proportionate morality.  And execution, of course, ends any chance that a defendant will acknowledge the claims of the morality we seek to enforce. More than three years after my colleagues and I read Chris Thomas's letter, a court in Lake County resentenced him to a hundred years in prison, meaning that, with good behavior, he could be released when he is seventy-one. He wept in court and apologized to the Gasgonia family for what he had done.    Supporters of capital punishment in Illinois, particularly those in law enforcement, often use Henry Brisbon as their trump card. Get rid of the death penalty, they say, and what do you do about the likes of Henry?  On the night of June 3, 1973, Brisbon and three 'rap partners' (his term) forced several cars off I-57, an interstate highway south of Chicago. Brisbon made a woman in one of the cars disrobe, and then he discharged a shotgun in her vagina. He compelled a young couple to lie down in a field together, instructed them to 'make this your last kiss,' and shot both of them in the back. His role in these crimes was uncovered only years later, when he confessed to an inmate working as a law librarian in the penitentiary where he was serving a stretch for rape and armed robbery. Because the I-57 killings occurred shortly after the Supreme Court declared capital punishment unconstitutional, Brisbon was not eligible for the death penalty. He was given a sentence of one thousand to three thousand years in prison, probably the longest term ever imposed in Illinois.  In October, 1978, eleven months after the sentencing, Brisbon murdered again. He placed a homemade knife to the throat of a guard to subdue him, then went with several inmates to the cell of another prisoner and stabbed him repeatedly. By the time Brisbon was tried again, in early 1982, Illinois had restored capital punishment, and he was sentenced to death. The evidence in his sentencing hearings included proof of yet another murder Brisbon had allegedly committed prior to his imprisonment, when he placed a shotgun against the face of a store clerk and blew him away. He had accumulated more than two hundred disciplinary violations while he was incarcerated, and had played a major role in the violent takeover of Stateville prison, in September, 1979. Predictably, the death sentence did not markedly improve Brisbon's conduct. In the years since he was first condemned, he has been accused of a number of serious assaults on guards, including a stabbing, and he severely injured another inmate when he threw a thirty-pound weight against his skull.  Brisbon is now held at the Tamms Correctional Center, a 'super-max' facility that houses more than two hundred and fifty men culled from an Illinois prison population of almost forty-five thousand. Generally speaking, Tamms inmates are either gang leaders or men with intractable discipline problems. I wanted to visit Tamms, hoping that it would tell me whether it is possible to incapacitate people like Brisbon, who are clearly prone to murder again if given the opportunity.  Tamms is situated near the southernmost point of Illinois, farther south than parts of Kentucky. The Mississippi, a wide body of cloacal brown, floods the nearby lowlands, creating a region of green marshes along orange sandstone bluffs. Tamms stands at the foot of one of those stone outcroppings, on a vast, savannalike grassland. The terms of confinement are grim. Inmates are permitted no physical contact with other human beings. Each prisoner is held twenty-three hours a day inside a seven-by-twelve-foot block of preformed concrete that has a single window to the outside, roughly forty-two by eighteen inches, segmented by a lateral steel bar. The cell contains a stainless-steel fixture housing a toilet bowl and a sink and a concrete pallet over which a foam mattress is laid. The front of the cell has a panel of punch-plate steel pierced by a network of half-inch circles, almost like bullet holes, that permit conversation but prevent the kind of mayhem possible when prisoners can get their hands through the bars. Once a day, an inmate's door is opened by remote control, and he walks down a corridor of cells to an outdoor area, twelve by twenty-eight feet, surrounded by thirteen-foot-high concrete walls, with a roof over half of it for shelter from the elements. For an hour, a prisoner may exercise or just breathe fresh air. Showers are permitted on a similar remote-control basis, for twenty minutes, several times a week.  In part because the facility is not full, incarceration in Tamms costs about two and a half times as much as the approximately twenty thousand dollars a year that is ordinarily spent on an inmate in Illinois, but the facility has a remarkable record of success in reducing disciplinary infractions and assaults. George Welborn, a tall, lean man with a full head of graying hair, a mustache, and dark, thoughtful eyes, was the warden of Tamms when I visited. I talked to him for much of the day, and toward the end asked if he really believed that he could keep Brisbon from killing again. Welborn, who speaks with a southern-Illinois twang, was an assistant warden at Stateville when Brisbon led the inmate uprising there, and he testified against him in the proceedings that resulted in his death sentence. He took his time with my question, but answered, guardedly, 'Yes.'  I was permitted to meet Brisbon, speaking with him through the punch-plate from the corridor in front of his cell. He is a solidly built African-American man of medium height, somewhat bookish-looking, with heavy glasses. He seemed quick-witted and amiable, and greatly amused by himself. He had read all about the commission, and he displayed a letter in which, many years ago, he had suggested a moratorium on executions. He had some savvy predictions about the political impediments to many potential reforms of the capital system.  'Henry is a special case,' Welborn said to me later, when we spoke on the phone. 'I would be foolish to say I can guarantee he won't kill anyone again. I can imagine situations, God forbid . . . But the chances are minimized here.' Still, Welborn emphasized, with Brisbon there would never be any guarantees.    I had another reason for wanting to visit Tamms. Illinois's execution chamber is now situated there. Unused for more than two years because of Governor Ryan's moratorium, it remains a solemn spot, with the sterile feel of an operating theatre in a hospital. The execution gurney, where the lethal injection is administered, is covered by a crisp sheet and might even be mistaken for an examining table except for the arm paddles that extend from it and the crisscrossing leather restraints that strike a particularly odd note in the world of Tamms, where virtually everything else is of steel, concrete, or plastic.  Several years ago, I attended a luncheon where Sister Helen Prejean, the author of 'Dead Man Walking,' delivered the keynote address. The daughter of a prominent lawyer, Sister Helen is a powerful orator. Inveighing against the death penalty, she looked at the audience and repeated one of her favorite arguments: 'If you really believe in the death penalty, ask yourself if you're willing to inject the fatal poison.' I thought of Sister Helen when I stood in the death chamber at Tamms. I felt the horror of the coolly contemplated ending of the life of another human being in the name of the law. But if John Wayne Gacy, the mass murderer who tortured and killed thirty-three young men, had been on that gurney, I could, as Sister Helen would have it, have pushed the button. I don't think the death penalty is the product of an alien morality, and I respect the right of a majority of my fellow-citizens to decide that it ought to be imposed on the most horrific crimes.    The members of the commission knew that capital punishment would not be abolished in Illinois anytime soon. Accordingly, our formal recommendations, many of which were made unanimously, ran to matters of reform. Principal among them was lowering the risks of convicting the innocent. Several of the thirteen men who had been on death row and were then exonerated had made dubious confessions, which appeared to have been coerced or even invented. We recommended that all interrogations of suspects in capital cases be videotaped. We also proposed altering lineup procedures, since eyewitness testimony has proved to be far less trustworthy than I ever thought while I was a prosecutor. We urged that courts provide pretrial hearings to determine the reliability of jailhouse snitches, who have surfaced often in Illinois's capital cases, testifying to supposed confessions in exchange for lightened sentences.  To reduce the seeming randomness with which some defendants appear to end up on death row, we proposed that the twenty eligibility criteria for capital punishment in Illinois be trimmed to five: multiple murders, murder of a police officer or firefighter, murder in a prison, murder aimed at hindering the justice system, and murder involving torture. Murders committed in the course of another felony, the eligibility factor used in Christopher Thomas's case, would be eliminated. And we urged the creation of a statewide oversight body to attempt to bring more uniformity to the selection of death-penalty cases.  To insure that the capital system is something other than an endless maze for survivors, we recommended guaranteed sentences of life with no parole when eligible cases don't result in the death penalty. And we also outlined reforms aimed at expediting the post-conviction review and clemency processes.  Yet our proposals sidestepped the ultimate question. One fall day, Paul Simon, the former U.S. senator who was one of the commission's chairs and is a longtime foe of the death penalty, forced us to vote on whether Illinois should have a death penalty at all. The vote was an expression of sentiment, not a formal recommendation. What was our best advice to our fellow-citizens, political realities aside? By a narrow majority, we agreed that capital punishment should not be an option.  I admit that I am still attracted to a death penalty that would be applied to horrendous crimes, or that would provide absolute certainty that the likes of Henry Brisbon would never again satisfy their cruel appetites. But if death is available as a punishment, the furious heat of grief and rage that these crimes inspire will inevitably short-circuit any capital system. Now and then, we will execute someone who is innocent, while the fundamental equality of each survivor's loss creates an inevitable emotional momentum to expand the categories for death-penalty eligibility. Like many others who have wrestled with capital punishment, I have changed my mind often, driven back and forth by the errors each position seems to invite. Yet after two years of deliberation, I seem to have finally come to rest. When Paul Simon asked whether Illinois should have a death penalty, I voted no.

"       The Atlantic Monthly | May 2003    Hitler's Forgotten Library: The Man, His Books, and His Search for God   You can tell a lot about a person from what he reads. The survivingand largely ignoredremnants of Adolf Hitler's personal library reveal a deep but erratic interest in religion and theology   by Timothy W. Ryback  .....   D id you know that today is Hitler's birthday?' the attendant said as he handed me Adolf Hitler's personal copy of Mein Kampf, a tattered red-leather volume (a special second edition issued in 1926) with the title and author's name embossed in gold on the spine. The young man, clean-cut and dressed in a sweatshirt bearing the skull and crossbones of the Curry College Rugby Football Club, explained that he knew this fact only because his sister shared a birthday with the Nazi leader. 'You remember something like that,' he said.  On this particular Friday (April 20, 2001, Adolf Hitler's 112th birthday) the rare-book reading room of the Library of Congressa high-ceilinged space elegantly appointed with brass lamps, heavy wooden tables, and thick carpethummed with subdued activity. At one table a heavy-set woman in a bright paisley blouse wore white gauze gloves to leaf through a fragile tome titled Histoire Aronautique, a collection of quaint eighteenth-century lithographs depicting aeronauts in powdered wigs transported aloft by fanciful pneumatic contraptions. A smartly dressed black woman with cropped hair and large hoop earrings studied a book on slavery in Barbados. Across from her a stocky man with a laptop clattered away as he typed extracts from a book cradled in a velvet-lined wooden stand. At another table a young man in a suit stared into an oversized volume of black-and-white photographs of graphic sexleather, chains, sprawled limbswith SEX embossed on the silver-metal cover.   The rare-book collection is home to more than 800,000 volumes. It contains the personal libraries of Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, and first editions of contemporary 'authors' such as Andy Warhol and Madonna. It is also home to the remnants of the private library of Adolf Hitler, a man better known for burning books than for collecting them.  The books that constitute the Hitler Library were discovered in a salt mine near Berchtesgadenhaphazardly stashed in schnapps crates with the Reich Chancellery address on themby soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division in the spring of 1945. After a lengthy initial evaluation at the U.S. military 'collecting point' in Munich the books, numbering 3,000, were shipped to the United States and transferred in January of 1952 to the Library of Congress, where an intern was assigned to uncrate the collection. 'The intern did what we call 'duping out,'' says David Moore, a German-acquisition assistant at the Library of Congress. 'If a book was not one hundred percent sure, if there was no bookplate, no inscription to the Fhrer, he didn't keep it.' According to Moore, duplicate copies were sent to the exchange-and-gift division and then either went to other libraries or found their way onto the open market; the non-duplicate books that could not be fully authenticated were absorbed into the Library of Congress's general collection.  The 1,200 volumes that survived the 'duping out' joined the rare-book collection on the third floor of the Jefferson Building, where they were unceremoniously identified by a large cardboard signdangling on a string from a ceiling pipethat read, 'Hitler Library. This bay only. Please replace books to proper location.'  The sign has since been removed, the books relocated several times, and the collection euphemistically renamed the Third Reich Collection. The books can be ordered, five at a time, from the main desk in the rare-book reading room. When I first visited the collection, in April of 2001, fewer than half of the 1,200 books had Library of Congress numbers, and only 200 of those were listed in the online catalogue; the remaining thousand titles were listed alphabetically by author on yellowing cards in an old-fashioned wooden card catalogue, many still identified by the provisional numbers assigned them in the early 1950s. Jerry Wager, the head of the rare-book reading room, told me at the time, 'Processing this collection has not been a high priority for us'; he also said that the books had been relocated yet again in recent months. 'We routinely move collections to make better use of existing space and to accommodate new acquisitions,' he said. A genteel man in his mid-fifties with a flawlessly manicured white beard, Wager is a master of discretion. When I asked about the Hitler collection's new location, he replied, 'For security reasons we don't reveal where collections are located in the vault.' He is equally circumspect about scholars who have previously studied the collection, simply noting that the books are requested only a few times each year, and generally by people looking for specific volumes rather than for an opportunity to study the collection as a whole.  Why, with hundreds of Hitler biographies, had not more scholars visited the Third Reich Collection? It is referenced by none of the leading Hitler biographersnot Alan Bullock, not John Toland, not Joachim Fest. Ian Kershaw, whose recent two-volume Hitler biography has won international acclaim, told me in the summer of 2001 that he visited the collection once, in the early 1990s, but 'decided against any consultation of the volumes in it, and in the event did not refer directly, so far as I recall, to the collection in my biography.' In retrospect, Kershaw concedes, he should probably have at least mentioned the collection in a footnote.    cholarly neglect of the Hitler Library derives in good part from an early misperception that its historical or biographical importance was limited. 'Spotchecks revealed little in the way of marginal notes, autographs, or other similar features of interest,' an internal Library of Congress review determined in January of 1952. 'Indeed, it seems that most of the books have never been perused by their owner.' Gerhard Weinberg, a leading authority on the Nazi era and one of the first scholars to explore the collection, confirms this initial assessment. 'I was a newly minted Ph.D., and this was my first job beyond graduate school,' Weinberg told me not long ago. 'I was compiling information for the Guide to Captured German War Documents. The books had only recently been uncrated, and I was intrigued by what I would find there.' To Weinberg's disappointment, the Hitler Library appeared to consist mostly of presentation copies from authors or publishers. 'There were few clues that many of these books had been part of his personal library, and even less evidence that he had read any of them,' Weinberg says.   In 2000 Philipp Gassert and Daniel Mattern reached a similar conclusion. Beginning in 1995 Gassert, an assistant professor of history at the University of Heidelberg, and Mattern, the senior editor at the German Historical Institute, in Washington, D.C., systematically reviewed every volume in the collection. In the spring of 2001 Greenwood Press published the results of their research, The Hitler Library, a 550-page bibliography that lists each book alphabetically, with its author, page count, and call number. Also included are transcriptions of all handwritten dedications, some brief descriptions of marginalia, and an indication of which books contain the Fhrer's bookplatean eagle, a swastika, and oak branches between the words EX LIBRIS and ADOLF HITLER.   The Hitler Library provides the first comprehensive road map through the collection, but at times it leads readers astray.  Most significant is overlooked marginalia. In one reference Mattern and Gassert note correctly that the Hitler Library contains two identical copies of Paul de Lagarde's German Essays, but they don't mention marginalia, despite the fact that in one volume fifty-eight pages have penciled intrusionsthe first on page 16, the last on page 370. Given that Lagarde belongs to a circle of nineteenth-century German nationalist writers who are believed to have had a formative influence on Hitler's anti-Semitism, the marked passages are certainly worth noting. In an essay called 'The Current Tasks of German Politics,' Lagarde anticipates the emergence of a 'singular man with the abilities and energy' to unite the German peoples, and calls for the 'relocation of the Polish and Austrian Jews to Palestine.' This latter phrase has been underlined and flagged with two bold strikes in the margin.  Sometimes writing along the side of a page is recognizably in Hitler's jagged cursive hand. For the most part, though, the marginalia are restricted to simple markings whose common 'authorship' is suggested by an intense vertical line in the margin and double or triple underlining in the text, always in pencil; I found such markings repeatedly both in the Library of Congress collection and in a cache of eighty Hitler books at Brown University. Hitler's handwritten speeches, preserved in the Federal German Archives, show an identical pattern of markings. In one anti-Semitic rant Hitler drew three lines under the words Klassenkampf ('class struggle'), Weltherrschaft ('world domination'), and Der Jude als Diktator ('the Jew as dictator'); one can almost hear his fevered tones.  Hitler's habit of highlighting key concepts and passages is consonant with his theory on the 'art of reading.' In Chapter Two of Mein Kampf he observed,  A man who possesses the art of correct reading will, in studying any book, magazine, or pamphlet, instinctively and immediately perceive everything which in his opinion is worth permanently remembering, either because it is suited to his purpose or generally worth knowing ... Then, if life suddenly sets some question before us for examination or answer, the memory, if this method of reading is observed ... will derive all the individual items regarding these questions, assembled in the course of decades, [and] submit them to the mind for examination and reconsideration, until the question is clarified or answered.  In these marginalia one sees a man (who famously seemed never to listen to anyone, for whom 'conversation' was little more than a torrent of monologues) reading passages, reflecting on them, and responding with penciled dashes, dots, question marks, exclamation points, and underscoringsintellectual footprints across the page. Here is one of history's most complex figures reduced merely to a reader with a book and a pencil.    ooks, books, always books!' August Kubizek once wrote. 'I just can't imagine Adolf without books. He had them piled up around him at home. He always had a book with him wherever he went.' Kubizek, Hitler's only real friend in his teenage years, recalled after the war that Hitler had been registered with three libraries in Linz, where he attended school, and had passed endless days in the baroque splendor of the Hofbibliothek, the former court library of the Hapsburgs, during his time in Vienna. 'Bcher waren seine Welt,' Kubizek wrote. 'Books were his world.'  Though Kubizek's reminiscences, first published in the 1950s, are in many ways suspect, his depiction of the future Fhrer as a bibliophile has been amply corroborated. One of Hitler's first cousins, Johann Schmidt, recounted for a Nazi Party history of the Fhrer that when Hitler spent summers with relatives in the tiny Waldviertel hamlet of Spital, he invariably arrived with 'lots of books in which he was constantly busy reading and working.' Hans Frank, Hitler's personal lawyer and the 'governor' of Nazi-occupied Poland, recalled before his 1946 execution at Nuremberg that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation with him throughout World War I. During his incarceration after the failed 1923 Munich putsch, Hitler was regularly supplied with reading materials by friends and associates. He once referred to his time in Landsberg Prison as his 'university paid for by the state.' During a bout of prison blues in December of 1924 he received a package from Winifred Wagner, the daughter-in-law of the composer Richard Wagner and one of the few people who addressed Hitler with the familiar du. It contained a book of Goethe's poetry from the Wagner family library. The 358-page volume, now at the Library of Congress, contains meditative classics such as 'Across All Peaks' and 'Evening Song,' accompanied by handsome full-page pen-and-ink drawings. The inside cover bears a handwritten inscription: 'Adolf Hitler, this picture book taken from the book garden of Eva Chamberlain, for your enjoyment in serious lonely hours! Bayreuth, Christmas 1924.'  Books seem to have been the gift of choice for Hitler on virtually every occasion. The Hitler Library contains scores of books bearing inscriptions for Christmas, his birthday, and other festive occasions. A book titled Death and Immortality in the World View of Indo-Germanic Thinkers is inscribed for Hitler by the SS chief Heinrich Himmler on the occasion of 'Julfest 1938'Nazi circumlocution for Christmas. I also discovered books from the controversial filmmaker Leni Riefenstahltwo on the Berlin Olympics and an eight-volume set of the complete works of the nineteenth-century German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte in a rare first edition. Given that Hitler had charged Riefenstahl with filming the Olympic Games, the presence of the first two volumes was understandable; the Fichte was more puzzling.  When I called on Riefenstahl, who lives outside Munich and had just marked her hundredth birthday, she referred me to her published memoirs, in which she devotes a chapter to the Fichte volumes. According to that account, in the spring of 1933 the thirty-year-old filmmaker approached Hitler about the plight of several Jewish friends. 'I have great esteem for you as an artist, you have a rare talent,' Hitler replied, according to Riefenstahl. 'But I cannot discuss the Jewish problem with you.' Mortified by his rebuke (Riefenstahl says she felt herself go faint), she later sought to make amends by sending Hitler the Fichte. Bound in white leather with gold embossing, the books bear the inscription 'Meinem lieben Fhrer in tiefster Verehrung ['To my dear Fhrer with deepest admiration'], Leni Riefenstahl.'   Fed by gifts and his own acquisitions, Hitler's library swelled dramatically in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In his 1925 tax declaration Hitler listed his total personal assets at a paltry 1,000 marks, and claimed 'no property' other than 'a writing table and two bookcases with books.' By 1930, however, as sales of Mein Kampf bolstered his income, book buying represented his third largest tax deduction (after general travel and transportation): 1,692 marks in 1930, with similar deductions in the two years following. More telling still is the five-year insurance policy Hitler took out in October of 1934, with the Gladbacher Fire Insurance Company, on his six-room apartment on the Prinzregentenplatz, in downtown Munich. In the letter of agreement accompanying the policy Hitler valued his book collection, said to consist of 6,000 volumes, at 150,000 markshalf the value of the entire policy. The other half represented his art holdings.  By the late 1930s Hitler had three separate libraries for his ever-expanding collection. At his apartment he removed a wall between two rooms and installed bookshelves. For the Berghof, his Alpine retreat near Berchtesgaden, Hitler built a second-floor study with handmade bookcases; color photographs of the finished space show an elegant setting with Oriental carpets, two globes, and bookcases fitted with glass doors and brass locks. Herbert Dhring, who managed the Berghof from 1936 to 1943, told me that the library could accommodate no more than 500 or 600 volumes. 'He reserved this space for the books he really cared about,' says Dhring, who helped Hitler to sort the books. 'He used to have me send the rest to a storage facility in Munich or to the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin.' For his official Berlin residence Hitler had his architect, Albert Speer, design a vast library that occupied the entire west wing. 'Inventory records of the Reich Chancellery that we found at the Hoover Institution at Stanford suggest that by the early 1940s Hitler was receiving as many as four thousand books annually,' Daniel Mattern told me. In Munich, Gassert and Mattern also discovered architectural sketches for a library annex to the Berghof that was intended to accommodate more than 60,000 volumes. 'This was a man with a lot of books,' Mattern says.    nfortunately, Hitler never inventoried his books, and the only detailed accounting of his libraries comes courtesy of the former United Press correspondent Frederick Oechsner, who met Hitler repeatedly and was evidently able to acquaint himself intimately with the Fhrer's book collections. 'I found that his personal library, which is divided between his residence in the Chancellery in Berlin and his country home on the Obersalzberg at Berchtesgaden, contains roughly 16,300 books,' Oechsner wrote in his best-selling book This Is the Enemy (1942).  According to Oechsner, the biggest single share of Hitler's library, some 7,000 books, was devoted to military matters, in particular 'the campaigns of Napoleon, the Prussian kings; the lives of all German and Prussian potentates who ever played a military role; and books on virtually all the well-known military campaigns in recorded history.' Another 1,500 volumes concerned architecture, theater, painting, and sculpture. 'One book on the Spanish theater has pornographic drawings and photographs, but there is no section on pornography, as such, in Hitler's Library,' Oechsner wrote. The balance of the collection consisted of clusters of books on diverse themes ranging from nutrition and health to religion and geography, with 'eight hundred to a thousand books' of 'simple, popular fiction, many of them pure trash in anybody's language.'  By his own admission, Hitler was not a big fan of novels, though he once ranked Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Don Quixote (he had a special affection for the edition illustrated by Gustave Dor) among the world's greatest works of literature. The one novelist we know Hitler loved and read was Karl May, a German writer of cheap American-style westerns. In the spring of 1933, just months after the Nazis seized power, Oskar Achenbach, a Munich-based journalist, toured the Berghofin the Fhrer's absenceand discovered a shelf of Karl May novels at Hitler's bedside. 'The bedroom of the Fhrer is of spartan simplicity,' Achenbach reported in the Sonntag Morgenpost. 'Brass bed, closet, toiletries, a few chairs, those are all the furnishings. On a bookshelf are works on politics and diplomacy, a few brochures and books on the care of German shepherds, and thenpay attention you German boys! Then comes an entire row of books byKarl May! Winnetou, Old Surehand, Bad Guy, all our dear old friends.' During the war Hitler reportedly admonished his generals for their lack of imagination and recommended that they all read Karl May. Albert Speer recounted in his Spandau diaries,  Hitler was wont to say that he had always been deeply impressed by the tactical finesse and circumspection that Karl May conferred upon his character Winnetou ... And he would add that during his reading hours at night, when faced by seemingly hopeless situations, he would still reach for those stories, that they gave him courage like works of philosophy for others or the Bible for elderly people. No one knows the exact extent of Hitler's library. Though Oechsner estimated the original collection at 16,000 volumes, Gassert and Mattern assert that it is impossible to determine the actual dimensions, especially since the majority of the books were either burned or plundered in the final weeks of the waran assumption confirmed in part by Florian Beierl, the head of the Archive for the Contemporary History of the Obersalzberg, in Berchtesgaden. According to Beierl, Hitler's Berghof experienced successive waves of looters: first local residents, then French and American soldiers, and eventually members of the U.S. Senate. Beierl showed me archival film footage (taken by the legendary World War II photographer Walter Rosenblum) of a delegation of American senatorsBurton Wheeler, Homer Capehart, and Ernest McFarlandemerging from the Berghof ruins with books under their arms. 'I doubt if they were taking them to the Library of Congress,' Beierl said.  I have also been told that a portion of the Hitler Library may have been seized by the Red Army. 'Stalin was so paranoid about Hitler that he sent trophy brigades to search for anything connected with him,' says Konstantin Akinsha, a former researcher for the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. 'His skull, his uniforms, Eva Braun's dresses, her underwearthey are all in Moscow.' Akinsha told me recently that in the early 1990s he heard rumors about a depository in an abandoned church in Uzkoe, a suburb of Moscow, that allegedly contained a huge quantity of 'trophy books,' including some that had belonged to Hitler.  Grigory Kozlov, another 'trophy' sleuth, confirms that a 'secret depository' did indeed exist in Uzkoe for more than four decades, with tens of thousands of books stacked from floor to ceiling. 'At the beginning of 1995 there was a big discussion about trophy books,' Kozlov told me. 'They decided to remove these books from Uzkoe and destroy all traces that showed there had been some sort of secret depository there.' Now, he says, the books have been dispersed anonymously in libraries and archives across Russia. 'I don't know what's true or not,' Kozlov told me. 'Books were evacuated without records, confiscated without records. I don't know if anyone is ready to talk.'   he 1,200 of Hitler's books in the Library of Congress most likely represent less than 10 percent of the original collection. Nevertheless, when I first visited the Hitler Library, in April of 2001, I was surprised to discover that despite the incompleteness of the collection, I could easily discern the collector preserved within his books. In more than 200 World War I memoirs, including Ernst Jnger's Fire and Blood, with a personal inscription to 'the Fhrer,' I encountered Hitler the 'Austrian corporal,' with his bushy moustache, his somber demeanor, and his battlefield service, during which he was twice wounded and for which he was twice decorated, once with the Iron Cross first class.   In two olive-drab paperbacks, guidebooks to the cultural monuments of Brussels and Berlin, published by Seemann Verlag and costing three marks each, I glimpsed Hitler the aspiring Frontsoldat-cum-artist. The Berlin guide has Hitler's signature in faded purple ink on the inside front cover, with the place and month of purchase: 'Fournes, 22 November 1915.' In the Brussels guide Hitler simply scrawled 'A. Hitler' in pencil; the last three letters trail downward like unspooling ribbon. A chapter on Frederick the Great is especially worn, its pages tattered, marked with fingerprints, and smeared with red candle wax. Tucked in the crease between pages 162 and 163 I found a three-quarter-inch strand of stiff black hair.  In dozens of books, with salutations from the likes of Prince August Wilhelmson of the last German Kaiserand the heirs of the Bechstein piano dynasty, I saw Hitler the protg of Germany's financial, social, and cultural elite. One book on Fhrertum'leadership'was presented to Hitler by the industrialist Fritz Thyssen, who had introduced him to some of Germany's leading businessmen at a decisive meeting in Dsseldorf in January of 1932. 'To the Fhrer, Adolf Hitler, in memory of his presentation to the Dsseldorf Industrial Club,' Thyssen wrote on the inside cover. Several books are inscribed to Hitler from Richard Wagner's youngest daughter, Eva, who had married Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Chamberlain was an anti-Semitic Englishman best known for his book The Foundations of the 19th Century, in which he advanced the thesis that Jesus was of Aryan rather than Semitic blood. Hitler read Chamberlain during his Vienna period, and had a brief audience with the aging anti-Semite at the Wagner estate shortly before being sent to Landsberg Prison. 'You know Goethe's differentiation between force and force,' Chamberlain wrote Hitler in October of 1923. 'There is force which comes from chaos and leads to chaos, and there is force which is destined to create a new world.' Chamberlain credited Hitler with the latter.   In a French vegetarian cookbook with an inscription from its author, Maa Charpentier, I encountered Monsieur Hitler vgtarien. And I found hints of Hitler the future mass murderer in a 1932 technical treatise on chemical warfare that explores the varying qualities of poison gas, from chlorine to prussic acid (Blausure). The latter was produced commercially as Zyklon B, which would be notorious for its use in the Nazi extermination camps.   I also found, however, a Hitler I had not anticipated: a man with a sustained interest in spirituality. Among the piles of Nazi tripe (much of it printed on high-acid paper that is rapidly deteriorating) are more than 130 books on religious and spiritual subjects, ranging from Occidental occultism to Eastern mysticism to the teachings of Jesus Christbooks with titles such as Sunday Meditations; On Prayer; A Primer for Religious Questions, Large and Small; Large Truths About Mankind, the World and God. Also included were a German translation of E. Stanley Jones's 1931 best seller, The Christ of the Mount; and a 500-page work on the life and teachings of Jesus, published in 1935 under the title The Son: The Evangelical Sources and Pronouncements of Jesus of Nazareth in Their Original Form and With the Jewish Influences. Some volumes date from the early 1920s, when Hitler was an obscure rabble-rouser on the fringe of Munich political life; others from his last years, when he dominated Europe.  One leather-bound tomewith WORTE CHRISTI, or 'Words of Christ,' embossed in gold on the coverwas well worn, the silky, supple leather peeling upward in gentle curls along the edges. Human hands had obviously spent a lot of time with this book. The inside cover bore a dedication: 'To our beloved Fhrer with gratitude and profound respect, Clara von Behl, born von Jansen von den Osten. Christmas 1935.'  Worte Christi was so fragile that when the attendant brought it to me, he placed it on a red-velvet pad in a wooden reading stand, a beautifully finished oak contraption with two supports that could be adjusted with small brass pegs to fit the dimensions of the book. No more than a foot wide and eighteen inches long, the stand had a sacred air, as if it belonged on an altar.  I reviewed the table of contents'Belief and Prayer,' 'God and the Kingdom of God,' 'Priests and Their Religious Practices,' 'The World and Its People'and skimmed the introduction; then I scanned the book for marginalia that might suggest a close study of the text. A white-silk bookmark, preserved in its original perfection between pages 22 and 23 (only the portion exposed to the air had deteriorated), lay across a description of the Last Supper as related by Saint John. A series of pages that followed contained only a single aphorism each: 'Believe in God' (page 31), 'Have no fear, just believe' (page 52), 'If you believe, anything is possible' (page 53), and so on, all the way to page 95, which offers the solemn wisdom 'Many are called but few are chosen.'   On page 241 appears the passage 'You should love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your spirit: this is the foremost and greatest commandment. Another is equally important: Love your neighbor as you would love yourself.' Beside this passage is one brief penciled line, the only mark in the entire book.  Given Hitler's legendary disdain for organized religion in general and Christianity in particular, I didn't expect him to have devoted much time to the teachings of Christ, let alone to have marked this quintessential Christian virtue. Had this in fact been made by the pencil of Hitler's younger sister, Paula, who occasionally visited her brother at the Berghof and remained a devout Catholic until her dying day? Might some other Berghof guest have responded to this holy Scripture?   Possiblybut though most of the spiritually oriented books in the Hitler Library were gifts sent to the Fhrer by distant admirers, several, like Worte Christi, were obviously well read, and some contained marginalia in Hitler's hand that suggested a serious exploration of spiritual matters. If Hitler was as deeply engaged with spiritual issues as his books and their marginalia suggest, then what was the purpose of this pursuit?   n the spring of 1943, while the outcome of World War II hung in the balance, the U.S. Office of Strategic Servicesforerunner to the CIAcommissioned Walter Langer, a Boston-based psychoanalyst, to develop a 'psychological profile' of Adolf Hitler. As Langer later recalled, this was the first time the U.S. government had attempted to psychoanalyze a world leader in order to determine 'the things that make him tick.'   Over the course of eight months, assisted by three field researchers and advised by three other experts in psychology, Langer compiled more than a thousand typewritten, single-spaced pages of material on his 'patient': texts from speeches, excerpts from Mein Kampf, interviews with former Hitler associates, and virtually every printed source available. Langer wrote,  A survey of all the evidence forces us to conclude that Hitler believes himself destined to become an Immortal Hitler, chosen by God to be the New Deliverer of Germany and the Founder of a new social order for the world. He firmly believes this and is certain that in spite of all the trials and tribulations through which he must pass he will finally attain that goal. The one condition is that he follow the dictates of the inner voice that have guided and protected him in the past. In his summary Langer outlined eight possible scenarios for Hitler's course of action in the face of defeat. The most likely scenario, he suggested in a prescient moment, was that Hitler's belief in divine protection would compel him to fight to the bitter end, 'drag[ging] a world with usa world in flames,' and that ultimately he would take his own life.  Langer based his assessment not only on Hitler's repeated references to 'divine providence,' both in speeches and in private conversations, but also on reports from some of Hitler's most intimate associates that Hitler truly believed he was 'predestined' for greatness and inspired by 'divine powers.' After the war Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, one of Hitler's chief military advisers, seemed to confirm the Langer thesis. 'Looking back,' he said, 'I am inclined to think he was literally obsessed with the idea of some miraculous salvation, that he clung to it like a drowning man to a straw.'   Experts since then have been of two minds on the matter of Hitler's spiritual beliefs. Ian Kershaw argues that Hitler consciously constructed an image of himself as a messianic figure, and eventually came to believe the very myth he had helped to fashion. 'The more he succumbed to the allure of his own Fhrer cult and came to believe in his own myth, the more his judgment became impaired by faith in his own infallibility,' Kershaw writes in The Hitler Myth (1987). But believing in a messianic myth is not the same as believing in God. When I asked Kershaw in 2001 whether he thought Hitler actually believed in divine providence, he dismissed the notion. 'I don't think that he had any real belief in a deity of any sort, only in himself as a 'man of destiny' who would bring about Germany's 'salvation,'' he declared. Gerhard Weinberg, who helped sort through the Hitler Library back in the 1950s, likewise dismisses the notion of Hitler as a religious believer, insisting that he was driven by the twin passions of Blut und Bodenracial purity and territorial expansion. 'He didn't believe in anything but himself,' Weinberg told me last summer. Most historians tend to agree.  Some non-historians, however, have different views. In the 1960s Friedrich Heer, a prominent and controversial Viennese theologian, identified Hitler as a misguided 'Austrian Catholic,' a man whose faith was disastrously misplaced but nevertheless sincere. In a dense, 750-page treatise Heer saw Hitler the Austrian Catholic at every turn: the nine-year-old choirboy catching his first glimpse of a swastika in the coat of arms at the Lambach Monastery; the beer-hall orator whose speeches resound with biblical allusions; the Fhrer of the Reich who re-created the splendor of the Catholic mass at the annual Nuremberg rally. Even his virulent hatred of Jewry found sustenance in those roots. Fritz Redlich, an eminent Yale psychiatrist, asserts in his book, Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet, that Hitler acted from a profound belief in God. Noting Hitler's own words 'Man kommt um den Gottesbegriff nicht um' ('You cannot get around the concept of God'), Redlich told me last summer that he was certain Hitler believed in a 'divine creature.' He rejected suggestions that Hitler's invocations of the divine were little more than cynical public posturing and insisted that we ought to take Hitler at his word: 'In a way, Hitler was a terrible liar, but he was a tactical liar. In his essential line of thinking he was honest.'  Traudl Junge, Hitler's former secretary, would not go so far as to say that Hitler believed in God, but she did believe that Hitler's repeated references to the divine were more than just for show. Jungewho died of cancer in February of last yeartold me the previous summer that Hitler spoke of such things in private as well as in public. After two and a half years of daily contact with Hitler, she was convinced that he believed in some form of divine protection, especially after surviving a dramatic assassination attempt in 1944. 'After the July 1944 attack,' she told me, 'I believe he felt himself to be an instrument of providence, and believed he had a mission to fulfill.'   n my hands I hold a book about Nostradamus, the sixteenth-century French mystic whose predictions of epic calamities have fascinated generations, and whose stanza 'From poor people a child will be born/ who with his tongue will seduce many people' has been interpreted as prophesying the rise of Adolf Hitler. Printed on high-acid paper, this volume, with its 137 brittle, crumbling pages, bears a publication date of 1921 but feels centuries older. The book promises to 'decypher and reveal for the first time the prophesies on the future of Europe and the rise and fall of France from 1555 to 2200.' Its final pages offer additional mystical edification in a series of advertisements for related texts: Memoirs of a Spiritualist, The Wandering Soul, How Can I Protect Myself From Suggestion and Hypnosis?, Soul and Cosmos, The Realm of the Invisible, and Human Destiny and the Course of the Stars. Pasted inside this moldering volume is one of Adolf Hitler's bookplates.   The Predictions of Nostradamus belongs to a cache of occult books that Hitler acquired in the early 1920s and that were discovered in the private quarters of his Berlin bunker by Colonel Albert Aronson in May of 1945. As part of the Allied occupation forces, Aronson was among the first Americans to enter Berlin after the collapse of the Nazi resistance. 'When my uncle arrived, the Russians took him on a tour of Hitler's bunker,' one of Aronson's nephews recalls. 'He said that the Russians had pretty much picked the place clean, but there were some pictures and a pile of books they let him take.' According to the nephew, the books remained in Aronson's attic until his death, at which point they were bequeathed to his nephew, who donated them to Brown University in 1979.   Today the eighty volumes are housed in the basement vault of Brown's rare-book collection at the John Hay Library, where they share shelf space with Walt Whitman's personal copy of a first edition of Leaves of Grass and John James Audubon's original folios of Birds of America. According to Samuel Streit, the associate librarian for special collections, the Hitler books have attracted virtually no attention from scholars. Streit himself has examined the collection only once, and his most vivid recollection was the Hitler bookplate. 'I know this sounds strange,' says Streit, an amiable man in his mid-fifties, 'but from the standpoint of bookplate design, it is quite tastefully done.'   Like the Library of Congress collection, Brown's eighty Hitler books constitute a hodgepodge: picture books, art journals, an Italian libretto of Wagner's Walkre, a 1937 edition of Mein Kampf, and two editions of Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century. The more than a dozen books on the occult include several devoted to Nordic runes, among them a 1922 history of the swastika, richly illustrated with nearly 500 diverse renderingsin Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek pottery, Mayan temples, and Christian crosses. The Dead Are Alive delivers 'incontrovertible evidence on occultism, somnambulism, spiritualism, with sixteen photographs of ghosts.' Among the photographic images that fill the final pages of the volume is one of five people levitating a table at an 1892 sance in Genoa and another allegedly showing the ghost of a fifteen-year-old Polish girl, Stasia, being consumed by a 'luminous, misty substance.' A picture of a rather stately-looking Englishman is captioned 'The Phantom of the English writer Charles Dickens who died in 1871 and is buried in Westminster Abbey. He appeared in 1873 and was photographed.'  The canon of Hitler historiography declares that Hitler flirted with occultism in the early 1920s, and that he recruited some of his closest ideological lieutenantsRudolf Hess, Martin Bormann, Alfred Rosenberg, and Heinrich Himmlerfrom the Thule Society and similar Nordic cults. 'When I first knew Adolf Hitler in Munich, in 1921 and 1922, he was in touch with a circle that believed firmly in the portents of the stars,' Karl Wiegand, a former Hitler associate, recalled in an article for Cosmopolitan in 1939.  'There was much whispering about the coming of 'another Charlemagne and a new Reich.' How far Hitler believed in these astrological forecasts and prophesies in those days I never could get out of the Fhrer. He neither denied nor affirmed belief. He was not averse, however, to making use of the forecasts to advance popular faith in himself and his then young and struggling movement.'  Most scholars dismiss the notion that Hitler seriously entertained the ideas of these cults, but the marginalia in several of his books confirm at least an intellectual engagement in the substance of Weimar-era occultism. The Brown collection contains books by such figures as Adamant Rohm, a 'magnetopathic doctor' from Wiesbaden; Carl Ludwig Schleich, a Berlin physician who pioneered the use of local anesthesia; and Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken, who wrote numerous books on reincarnation and otherworldly phenomena under the pseudonym B Yin R.   One of the most heavily marked books is Magic: History, Theory and Practice (1923), by Ernst Schertel. When I typed the author's name into one Internet search engine, I scored eight hits, including sites on Satanism, eroticism, sadomasochism, and flagellation. When I typed his name into Google, I scored twenty-six hits, including sites on parapsychology, astrology, and diverse sexual practices. According to a Web site for Germany's sadomasochistic community, Schertel wrote numerous books on flagellation and eroticism, and was 'a central figure' in the German nudist movement of the 1920s and 1930s.  Hitler's copy of Magic bears a handwritten dedication from Schertel, scrawled on the title page in pencil. A 170-page softcover in large format, the book has been thoroughly read, and its margins scored repeatedly. I found a particularly thick pencil line beside the passage 'He who does not carry demonic seeds within him will never give birth to a new world.'    ne of the oldest volumes of literature still in the Hitler Library is a 1917 German edition of Peer Gynt, Henrik Ibsen's epic of a 'Nordic Faust' who cuts a swath of human sufferingbetraying friends, abandoning women, trading in slaves, and committing cold-blooded murderon his way to becoming 'emperor of the whole world.' When challenged to account for his sundry trespasses, Gynt declares that he would rather burn in hell for excessive sins than simmer in obscurity with the rest of humanity. Edvard Grieg set this cruel play to beautiful music. Hitler's copy of Peer Gynthandsomely illustrated by Otto Sagerbears a simple inscription by its German translator: 'Intended for his dear friend Adolf Hitler. Dietrich Eckart. Munich, October 22, 1921.'  Few people could call Hitler 'Freund,' and fewer still 'lieber Freund.' For Hitler, Eckart was both friend and family, a mentor and a father figure. When the two men first met, late in 1919, Hitler was a thirty-year-old political upstart a little more than a year out of the trenches, without a penny to his name. Eckart was a fifty-one-year-old playwright with a runaway hit (his adaptation of Peer Gynt), a paintbrush moustache, a morphine addiction, and a legendary hatred of Jews; one Munich newspaper described him as a 'raging anti-Semite' who would 'ideally like to consume a half dozen Jews daily with his sauerkraut.' After working with Hitler at an early Nazi Party event, Eckart began grooming him for political life. He bought Hitler his first trench coat, gave him instruction in public speaking, and introduced him to members of Munich society, often with the icebreaker 'This is the man who will one day liberate Germany.' Hitler once called Eckart the 'polar star' of the Nazi movement, and dedicated the first volume of Mein Kampf to him. 'Follow Hitler!' Eckart allegedly exhorted on his deathbed, in 1923. 'He will dance, but the music to which he dances was composed by me.'  For all the vitriol Hitler spewed upon Judaism, he came to hold Christianity in equal disdain. 'Christianity is the worst thing that ever happened to mankind,' he declared during an after-dinner rant in July of 1941. 'Bolshevism is the illegitimate child of Christianity. Both are an outgrowth of the Jew.'   Hitler was the classic apostate. He rebelled against the established theology in which he was born and bred, all the while seeking to fill the resulting spiritual void. As the Hitler Library suggests, he found no shortage of latter-day prophets peddling alternative theologies. Mathilde von Kemnitz, the wife of Erich Ludendorff, the venerated World War I general who joined Hitler in the Munich putsch, promoted a neo-Teutonic pagan cult that called for the destruction of churches and the creation of forest temples and places of sacrifice. A 1922 volume of her writings, Triumph of the Will to Immortality, bears a bizarre and cryptic inscription to Hitler.  Now don't forget you young, blessed soul, If you never leave the afterlife You will thus be a perfect God For as long as you live. Hitler tolerated Kemnitz's neo-pagan looniness until Ludendorff's death, in December of 1937. In the autumn of 1939 the Nazi government, invoking wartime rationing, terminated paper supplies for Kemnitz's publication At the Holy Well (Am Heiligen Quell), effectively silencing her movement. Kemnitz, who survived the war, never forgave Hitler the betrayal.  Guida Diehl, a prolific Weimar writer who fancied herself the 'female Fhrer,' showered Hitler with titles, including Burn! Holy Flame! and The Will of the German Woman. In a handbook on how to conduct a German Christmas in 'times of need and struggle,' Diehl wrote to Hitler, 'We struggle for the German soul, which fashioned the German Christmas from Christ himself! Sieg heil!' There is no indication that Hitler ever opened, let alone read, any of Diehl's books.  Unquestionably the most significant unread volume in the Hitler collection is a 1940 edition of Alfred Rosenberg's The Myth of the Twentieth Century, the Nazi classic that, with more than a million copies in print at the time, was second only to Mein Kampf for the Nazi movement. In the course of its 800 pages Rosenberg delivered the theological framework for a National German Church intended to subsume 'the best of the protestant and catholic churches' and eliminate the 'Jew-infested Old Testament.' Denouncing the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as a 'counterfeit of the great image of Christ,' Rosenberg envisioned a 'fifth gospel' depicting Jesus as an Aryan superman'The powerful preacher and the raging prophet in the temple, the man who inspired, and whom everyone followed, not the sacrificial lamb of the Jewish prophets, not the man on the cross.'   This particular edition of Rosenberg's legendary anti-Semitic screed has a handsome dark-blue linen cover and contains a full-page black-and-white photograph of Rosenberg standing before a shelf of leather-bound books. Dressed in a three-piece suit, he looks more like a Boston banker than the ideological fanatic who wrote some of the most offensive and impenetrable prose of the Nazi era before being hanged in Nuremberg in 1946. The book bears the Hitler bookplate but is in mint condition; the binding cracked when I opened the cover.  Despite Rosenberg's repeated attempts to establish his Myth as official party doctrine, Hitler insisted that the book was a 'private publication' that represented Rosenberg's personal opinions. In conversations Hitler admitted that he had read only 'small portions' of it and described it as unreadable. Joseph Goebbels concurred, calling The Myth an 'intellectual belch.'  Hitler's selective readingor nonreadingof the pseudo-theological texts in his library makes those books he did read, and especially those in which he left marginalia, all the more significant. Here is where the Hitler Library is most useful. In the Fichte volumes given to him by Riefenstahl, I encountered a veritable blizzard of underlines, question marks, exclamation points, and marginal strikes that sweeps across a hundred printed pages of dense theological prose. Where Fichte peeled away the spiritual trappings of the Holy Trinity, positing the Father as 'a natural universal force,' the Son as the 'physical embodiment of this force,' and the Holy Ghost as an expression of the 'light of reason,' Hitler not only underlined the entire passage but placed a thick vertical line in the margin, and added an exclamation point for good measure.   As I traced the penciled notations, I realized that Hitler was seeking a path to the divine that led to just one place. Fichte asked, 'Where did Jesus derive the power that has held his followers for all eternity?' Hitler drew a dense line beneath the answer: 'Through his absolute identification with God.' At another point Hitler highlighted a brief but revealing paragraph: 'God and I are One. Expressed simply in two identical sentencesHis life is mine; my life is his. My work is his work, and his work my work.'   Among the numerous volumes dealing with the spiritual, the mystical, and the occult I found a typewritten manuscript that could well have served as a blueprint for Hitler's theology. This bound 230-page treatise is titled The Law of the World: The Coming Religion and was written by a Munich resident named Maximilian Riedel. During the first week of August 1939 the manuscript was hand-delivered to Anni Winter, Hitler's longtime Munich housekeeper, with the request that it be passed to Hitler personally. An accompanying letter read,  Mein Fhrer!  Based on a new discovery I have been able to prove, with incontrovertible scientific evidence, the concept of the trinity of God as a natural law. One of the results of this discovery is, among other things, the seamless relationship between the terms: Truth-Law-Duty-Honor. In essence, the origins of all science, philosophy and religion. The significance of this discovery has led me to ask Frau Winter to hand to you personally the enclosed manuscript.  Heil mein Fhrer! Max Riedel Grnwald Oberhachingerweg 1 Riedel made a smart tactical move in delivering his manuscript to Hitler's Munich residence. Whereas at the Berghof, Hitler received hundreds of books, and at the Reich Chancellery all such correspondence went through secretaries' hands, in Munich the only filter was Hitler's housekeeper. Based on the marginalia, it seems that Hitler not only received the Riedel manuscript but also read it carefully with pencil in hand. Individual sentences and entire paragraphs are underlined, sometimes twice or even three times.   In this densely written treatise Riedel established the groundwork for his 'new religion,' replacing the Trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with a new tripartite unity, the 'Krper, Geist und Seele''body, mind, and soul.' Riedel argued that traditionally mankind has recognized five senses, which relate only to the physical aspects of our existence, and that this hinders our ability to perceive the true nature of our relationship to God and the universe. He offered seven additional 'senses' that every human being possesses, which are related to the subjective perception of the world; among them Riedel included our inherent sense of what is right and wrong, our emotional sense of another person, our sense of self-preservation. On a two-page centerfold he illustrated his theory with a circular diagram in which various concepts'soul,' 'space,' 'reality,' 'present,' 'past,' 'possibility,' 'transformation,' 'culture,' 'afterlife,' 'humanity,' 'infinity'are connected by a spider web of lines. 'The body, mind and soul do not belong to the individual, they belong to the universe,' the author explained.  Riedel's 'trinity' seems to have attracted Hitler's particular attention. A dense penciled line parallels the following passage: 'The problem with being objective is that we use objective criteria as the basis for human understanding in general, which means that the objective criteria, that is, the rational criteria, end up serving as the basis for all human understanding, perception and decision-making.' By using the five traditional senses to achieve this 'objectivity,' Riedel declared, human beings exclude the possibility of perceivingthrough the additional seven senses he identifiedthe deeper forces of the world, and are thus unable to achieve that unity of body, mind, and soul. 'The human mind never decides things on its own, it is the result of a discourse between the body and the soul,' he claimed.   The sentence not only caught Hitler's attentionbeneath it is a thick line, and beside it in the margin are three parallel pencil marksbut was echoed two years later in one of his monologues. 'Mind and soul ultimately return to the collective being of the world,' Hitler told some guests in December of 1941. 'If there is a God, then he gives us not only life but also consciousness and awareness. If I live my life according to my God-given insights, then I cannot go wrong, and even if I do, I know I have acted in good faith.'   As I sat in the rarefied seclusion of the Jefferson Building's second-floor reading room one day, listening to the muffled roar of traffic and the distant wail of police sirens in late-summer Washington, I attempted to comprehend the full significance of this sentence to which Hitler seems to have responded so emphatically. Back in 1943 Walter Langer had concludedcorrectly, to my mindthat in order to understand Hitler one had to understand his profound belief in divine powers. But Hitler believed that the mortal and the divine were one and the same: that the God he was seeking was in fact himself.

It begins as a light story of a young Jewish-American traveling to the Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis.

The characters will stay with book groups for weeks afterwards.' --Deb Wehmeier, Garden District Book Shop, New Orleans, LA   THE LOVELY BONES, by Alice Sebold (Little, Brown, $21.95 hardcover, 0316666343) 'Teenage Susie Salmon, speaking from heaven, will mesmerize readers and enthrall on every page.

Due to a genetic disorder, Henry DeTamble finds himself spontaneously displaced in time to different moments in his past and future, many of which involve the love of his life, Clare Abshire.

Readers will be riveted as Otsuka tells their stories in a poignant and powerful voice.

Miles Roby, a short-order cook, faces many dilemmas that are both real and discussable. Told with humor and drama, this book draws a detailed picture of American life and personal conflict.' --Debra Goldenberg, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR   THE MIRACLE LIFE OF EDGAR MINT, by Brady Udall (Vintage, $14, 0375719180) 'From the moment the mailman runs over his head, this kid grabs your attention and your heart and doesn't let go. Edgar takes everything that life has to throw at him, teaches us about good and evil, and, in the end, finds his own place in the world. Is he admirable, pathetic, or a bit twisted? You decide.' --Barb Bassett, The Red Balloon Bookshop, St. Paul, MN   MYSTIC RIVER, by Dennis Lehane (HarperTorch, $7.99, 0380731851) 'Mystic River is not a light read, nor even a book you must read in one devouring gulp (although you may not be able to resist it), but it is a story you will chew over and over and over. An urban crime novel of surpassing darkness, it can stand as a Notable Book, a fiction of its time and place like, say, Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby or the Dostoevsky novel it more nearly resembles. An amazing work and a great choice for book groups.' --Barbara Peters, The Poisoned Pen, Scottsdale, AZ   UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, by Frances Mayes (Broadway, $15, 0767900383) 'This enchanting novel is a great escape -- if you've ever dreamed of going to Italy, this is the book for you.

This novel will consistently intrigue devotees of science fiction, as well as those who don't usually read books in this genre because of the way in which it addresses both spiritual questions, and the unintended consequences of exploring new worlds.' --Cammie Mannino, Halfway Down the Stairs, Rochester, MI   WICKED: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, by Gregory Maguire (Regan Books, $15, 0060987103) 'Maguire tells the familiar story of The Wizard of Oz from the point of view of the Wicked Witch of the West. In the process, he gives us a fascinating look at being an outsider and the nature of good and evil, and reminds us that the winner of any given conflict is the one who gets to tell the story.' --Peggy Hailey, BookPeople, Austin, TX   The Art World   GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, by Tracy Chevalier (Plume, $14, 0452282152) 'Chevalier eloquently captures the essence of an artist and his time, with reflections on class and culture in 1660s Holland. I gained a new appreciation for art and history after reading this beautifully written and evocative novel based on the relationship between Vermeer and a serving girl.' --Carrie Sutherland, JW Beecroft Books & Coffee, Superior, WI   HEADLONG, by Michael Frayn (Picador, $14, 0312267460) 'Martin Clay -- a philosopher who will follow any siren song that takes him away from the book he is supposed to be writing -- believes that he has discovered an authentic Bruegel painting stuck in a dusty corner of a neighboring country squire's chilly manse. Can he acquire it, and convince his art-historian wife that the painting is what he thinks it is? A wonderfully discussable meditation on obsession, self-deception, and the lore and lure of great art.' --Valerie Ryan, Cannon Beach Book Company, Cannon Beach, OR   THE PASSION OF ARTEMISIA, by Susan Vreeland (Penguin, $13, 0142001821) 'A vibrant tale of 18th century patriarchal society and its effects on the life of a brilliant female artist.

Though she ultimately walked out on her ranch-wife life, Blunt pays homage to her past. Readers will be left with a sense of awe, not only for a giant land and the wind that strips it raw, but also for one woman's humble and brave act of breaking free.' --Judy Klein, Chapter One Book Store, Hamilton, MT   THE POWER OF THE DOG, by Thomas Savage (Back Bay, $13.95, 0316610895) 'This is the story of one family's internal hierarchy on an isolated ranch, where the struggle to eke out some kind of happiness leads ultimately to murder. The actual and metaphorical landscapes Savage describes are rich enough to keep any book group discussion lively. Every reader will see something different in the story.' --RoseMarie London, Chickering Bookstore, Laramie, WY   RED WATER, by Judith Freeman (Anchor, $14, 0385720696) 'Red Water is the story of the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre in southern Utah, told by three of the wives of John Lee, the man who was blamed for the slaughter. The women's characters vividly come to life, and their personalities shine through and make this an exciting read and a great discussion book.' --Catherine Jordan, Orinda Books, Orinda, CA   UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN, by Jon Krakauer (Doubleday, $26 hardcover, 0385509510) 'In addition to the true story of the Mormon brothers who murdered their sister-in-law and her baby in God's name, Krakauer discusses the history of the Mormon Church and its numerous fundamentalist spin-offs. This book will provide ample fodder for discussion, because the book highlights both the good and bad sides of the mainstream Mormon Church.' --Gary D. Robson, Red Lodge Books, Red Lodge, MT  Family Dramas   CROW LAKE, by Mary Lawson (Delta, $12.95, 0385337639) 'An elegant, well-paced tale of a family striving to manage its responsibilities in the face of monumental tragedy.

BEL CANTO: A Novel, by Ann Patchett (Perennial, $13.95, 0060934417) 'In Bel Canto, a ratty group of terrorists holds hostage an opera singer and a group of dignitaries in a South American country.

KIMBLE, by Jennifer Haigh (Perennial, $13.95, 0060509406) 'I love to begin a book without first reading the jacket copy ... especially one like this, where I managed to get well into the book before realizing exactly what was going on. The character of each of the three Mrs. Kimbles is beautifully developed -- and through these women, we learn about Mr. Kimble. What a great book club book!' --Liz Murphy, Learned Owl Book Shop, Hudson, OH   POPE JOAN, by Donna Cross (Ballantine, $14.95, 0345416260) 'The Catholic Church denies (and/or has covered up) the existence of Pope Joan, so this book is a work of literary historical fiction. Whether or not you believe her story, you'll be enthralled by Pope Joan. It's all here: war, romance, Vatican intrigue, politics, and a shocking ending. Rich in discussion topics, Pope Joan continues to be a perennial favorite of our book clubs.' --Kate Larson, Book Passage, Corte Madera, CA   THE RED TENT, by Anita Diamant (Picador, $14.95, 0312195516) 'The Red Tent offers something for readers of all ages and backgrounds.

As in her earlier books, Chevalier expresses interest in the special difficulties and issues faced by women, and here she also makes note of cultural differences. Add in a centuries-old crime, and the book comes alive for discussion.' --Blanchette W. Bailey, Baileywick Books, New Milford, CT   Going Behind the Headlines   THE HEMINGWAY BOOK CLUB OF KOSOVO, by Paula Huntley (Tarcher/Penguin, $13.95, 1585422932) 'A remarkable journal of the author's eight months spent volunteering as an English teacher in Kosovo.

This is the true story of the people who serve us our food in restaurants, clean our houses, and even help take care of our elderly parents. Book groups will grapple with the fact that these are jobs that have to be done -- but can anyone really afford to do them?' --Stacey Carr, Scott's Bookstore, Mount Vernon, WA   READING LOLITA IN TEHRAN: A Memoir in Books, by Azar Nafisi (Random House, $13.95, 081297106X) 'This memoir about secretly teaching Western literature to a small group of young women in revolutionary Iran is structured around the novels studied; each section reveals both the transformative powers of literature and the tragic consequences of repression.

It begins as a light story of a young Jewish-American traveling to the Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. However, the novel grows from laugh-out-loud to very serious as history is revealed in a fantastical, magical-realism sort of way. The characters will stay with book groups for weeks afterwards.' --Deb Wehmeier, Garden District Book Shop, New Orleans, LA   THE LOVELY BONES, by Alice Sebold (Little, Brown, $21.95 hardcover, 0316666343) 'Teenage Susie Salmon, speaking from heaven, will mesmerize readers and enthrall on every page.

A multi-layered work that will resonate with readers from young adults on up.' --Nancy Colalillo, Tome on the Range Books, Las Vegas, NM   THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, by Audrey Niffenegger (MacAdam/Cage, $25 hardcover, 1931561648) 'This is an engaging love story chronicled like no other. Due to a genetic disorder, Henry DeTamble finds himself spontaneously displaced in time to different moments in his past and future, many of which involve the love of his life, Clare Abshire. Book groups will discover the connections between these two soul mates in the same way they do themselves -- through a patchwork of scenes, eras, and settings that ultimately connects into one poignant history.' --Tom Heywood, The Babbling Book, Haines, AK   WHITE TEETH, by Zadie Smith (Vintage, $14, 0375703861) 'Reading groups will not be disappointed by this brilliant debut from a young writer with an uncanny knack for dialogue and description. Cockney Archie and Bengali Samad become lifelong friends after serving together in World War II, and the tragicomic tale of their families weaves themes of fate, free will, race, religion, and assimilation into plot lines involving mutant mice, radical vegetarians, and more.' --Carla Jimenez, Inkwood Books, Tampa, FL   History   BLUE LATITUDES: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before, by Tony Horwitz (Picador, $15, 0312422601) 'Horwitz vividly recounts the three epic voyages of Captain James Cook and confirms his place as one of the greatest navigators in maritime history.

There's plenty of grist for any book group's mill.' --Will Peters, Annie Bloom's Books, Portland, OR   PIANO TUNER, by Daniel Mason (Vintage, $14, 1400030382) 'Mason's sensitive writing details images of colonial Burma and the British Empire of the late 1800s. He translates a simple story of duty, love, and companionship into a fascinating account that merges history, music, geography, and colonial politics.' --Charlie Peterson, Books by the Way, Vashon, WA   SPIES, by Michael Frayn (Picador, $13, 0312421176) 'Stephen Wheatley finds himself compelled to return to his childhood home, and to disturbing memories of a long-forgotten summer in wartime London, 50 years before. As the story unfolds, reading groups will see how Frayn demonstrates that things -- and people -- are not always what they seem.' --Robin Buckingham, Lindon Bookstore, Enumclaw, WA   THE STORY OF LUCY GAULT, by William Trevor (Penguin, $14, 014200331X) 'Nine-year-old Lucy Gault goes missing the very morning her family must leave behind their beloved home in Ireland.

"        HIGHLIGHTS    BUSINESS – HEALTH CARE   Sales of Health and Beauty Products to Ethnic Men Surpass $1.4 Billion   Increased knowledge and acceptance of grooming practices by male consumers plays key role.   African American, Hispanic and Asian American men spend more than $1.4 billion on personal care items, including both general-use and ethnic-specific health and grooming products, by 2008, sales in the category are expected to climb to $1.7 billion, experiencing a healthy gain of nearly 20 percent.  Increased magazine and television coverage of men’s grooming issues, from the application of skin creams to proper shaving techniques, have helped grow sales in the ethnic male category and in the men’s grooming category overall. The estimates are currently 84 million African American, Asian, and Hispanic men in the United States.  Men in general tend to be overlooked in the personal care industry – and ethnic males are no exception. But the truth is that ethnic men present a lucrative audience to marketers, and, with the explosive growth of the Hispanic population, can offer opportunities in the overall men’s grooming industry, which of late has been stagnant.

The metaphor suggests that the software giant is facing a long and bitter struggle against irrational fanatics who are passionately anti-Microsoft.   But there was nothing extreme or irrational about the way in which Munich City Council this week calmly and democratically dealt Microsoft one of the biggest blows it has suffered in its short corporate history. After a year's trial, the City's burghers voted 50-29, in a closed door meeting, to migrate all of its 14,000 Microsoft based desktop computers over to Linux, the Open Office desktop suite, and the open source Mozilla browser.   The contract is not huge - with the initial training and implementation, it is believed to be worth less than €20million - but it is very high profile, with key suppliers on both sides viewing this a key battle in a long war. Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer famously broke off a skiing trip to travel to Munich and offer huge discounts if the City stuck with Microsoft, while IBM and Novell, owner of the Linux operating system supplier Suse, both gave thousands of hours of expertise to help run the pilot. (Even then, Munich admitted to Information Age in January 2004 that the trial had suffered 'technical difficulties'.)   The end of the trial now means that the contract to supply the systems will now be put out to tender – following the rigorous rules set out for public purchasing by the European Commission. HP, Dell and IBM are expected to be among the bidders.  Throughout Europe this year, a succession of public sector authorities have announced plans to migrate to Linux, but in most cases this has meant moving from Unix servers to Linux servers, often staying with the same hardware supplier. Very few organisations have migrated their desktops to Linux. Many of those evaluated Linux are worried about possible instability, the potential loss of key features in Microsoft's Office Suite, possible file incompatibilities, especially when exchanging documents with trading partners, a lack of skills, and staff resistance.   Microsoft executives dismissed the Munich decision, saying that there are peculiar factors involved and that IBM had helped to drive the decision. Even so, Microsoft is becoming worried – as its Roadshow demonstrates.   Analysts believe Munich is a crucial milestone that will accelerate adoption of Linux on the desktop. IDC has forecast that Linux desktop market share will grow from 3% to 6% from 2004 to 2007. Although Microsoft's share is currently a massive 95%, the loss of 3%-4% share amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars lost in Windows and Office licences. If that share were to fall faster, as Linux proponents believe is likely, then Microsoft would begin to suffer serious financial consequences.  Meanwhile, some journalists have been questioning Microsoft's marketing tactics, suggesting that the Roadshow shows 'fear' that businesses will pick up on. But Microsoft believes that in a war like this, it has to take the offensive.

The engineer, Jason Smathers, 24, apparently used the identity of another AOL employee to gain access to the company's list of customer email addresses on a supposedly highly secure database. He also took their telephone numbers, postal codes and the type of credit card they use. Fortunately, credit card numbers are kept on a separate database.  He sold the information to the owner of an Internet gambling site, Sean Dunaway, 21, who wanted to spam the addresses to promote his site. Smathers is also said to have sold the list to others although no details have been disclosed.  The two men are the first to be prosecuted under the new US 'CAN-SPAM' law. It requires a business relationship to exist between the sender and recipient of a commercial email and in this way, aims to make certain types of spam illegal. It also mandates working unsubscribe links in any email.  Under the law, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.  Smathers was caught out when AOL was pursuing a lawsuit against a group of spammers in early 2004. During an interview, it emerged that someone had bought addresses from an AOL employee in order to send spam promoting penis enlargement pills.

Ashraf Hasson and Hasanen Nawfal are both natives of Baghdad.  Like many 20-somethings, Hasson and Nawfal grew up nurturing passions for computers and for programming.  Both of them are firm believers in open source software. Unlike expensive proprietary software, open-source software can be freely distributed and modified, as long as the modifications are shared with other users.  They are particularly fans of Linux operating system.  These two Linux enthusiasts, though, did not even know one another before the ousting of Saddam Hussein.  But they found each other online, in a Linux forum hosted by Iraqi expatriates, soon after Saddam fell and started thinking about what they could do.  'Every country has a Linux users group except Iraq, so I thought, maybe Iraq deserves to have a Linux users group,' said Ashraf Hasson.  'We started sending e-mails, and trying to figure out how to help Iraqi people here to know about Linux, educate them, spread the word. And so we did.'    Cost savings   The Iraqi Linux User Group has now been up and running for a little more than a year.  'I wanted to find people to share knowledge with,' explained Hasanen Nawfal, 'to learn from them, to speak with guys who share my thoughts.'  The Iraqi Linux User Group website lists more than 200 members, most of whom are Iraqi expatriates.  They are united in their belief that open-source software like Linux could help their nation.  Its chief advantage is that Linux code is free to use and modify.  To Nabil Suleiman, a member of the Iraqi Linux User Group living in Canada, Linux could mean significant cost savings.  'There is a shortage in power and water supplies, and sewage systems, so the last thing Iraq needs is spending billions of dollars on very expensive and overpriced products, especially software products,' he said.  'We believe that Linux can save us lots of money in this field.'    Illegal software   But it is about more than just cost for the Iraqi Linux User Group.  The open source enthusiasts believe it could allow Iraqis to build their own home-grown technologies.  'This enables the country to build its own infrastructure based on open source, on open ideas,' Ashraf Hasson.  'That might help establish a solid base for Iraqi technology, and help not constrain the country with proprietary software and prevent monopolisation over Iraq by such major companies.'  But getting Iraqis to think about Linux is an uphill battle. Most have never touched a computer, let alone thought about what operating system they want to use.  Computer software is now more widely available in Iraq, but little of it open-source.  'Currently, most software in use in Iraq is illegal copies of proprietary software,' explained Don Marti editor of the US-based Linux Journal.  Software giants like Microsoft, he said, are happy to hook Iraqis on their software.  'Proprietary software companies are using these illegal copies as a free sample program, and a marketing tool, as they have in other countries.'  'When the crackdown comes, and the people in Iraq start having to comply with the licenses for this software, then they're going to be in trouble.'  It means Iraqis are going to have to start paying companies like Microsoft, who declined to be interviewed.    Obstacles in the way   Ashraf Hasson of the Iraqi Linux User Group said he would actually welcome tech giants like Microsoft coming into the Iraqi market.  He grudgingly even admitted that the Windows operating system may be OK for 'people who want to do basic stuff'.  But he is pushing small and medium-sized businesses, and the Iraqi government, to consider running open-source software on their servers.  He is also leading Linux seminars at a couple of Iraq's larger universities.  And Nabil Suleiman in Canada says that some expatriate members of the user group want to open a Linux training centre in Baghdad.  'But it all depends on how the political issues and all the other issues are resolved there,' he said.  'I think it will take between two years and five years to stabilise the whole system, and then we can start building on a more stable foundation.'  Inside the country, the Iraqi Linux User Group is thinking big. Their ambitious goal is to see every server in the country running Linux a year from now.  Getting there, they face numerous obstacles.  'Security, electricity shortage, poor communications, blurred view of the future, money, bad response from government, lack of resources,' explained Hasanen Nawfal, 'too many to mention.'

She could not have conceived in her wildest imagination, Kanishka said, that 15 years later she'd not only be coming back, but also directing one of the nation's largest employers. Nor would she have envisioned her role as envoy of a discount Internet retailer located in, of all places, Salt Lake City.   'I can't say it's a dream come true, because I don't think I could have had a dream like this 17 years ago,' said Kanishka, who moved to the United States from Pakistan in 1997 with her husband, a former childhood friend who had been working in the States.  The couple settled in Salt Lake City, where Kanishka later took a job as a customer service rep for Overstock.com, a site specializing in product liquidations. After little more than a year on the job, she took over management of the website's Worldstock division, which sells handmade goods.   These days, Worldstock employs more than 1,500 Afghan artisans among a worldwide network of craft workers. It's an accomplishment that Overstock's CEO, Patrick Byrne, attributes to both an upswing in online retail spending and reliable demand for inexpensive handmade rugs.   That confluence of factors culminated this week in a confirmation by the Afghan Ministry of Commerce that Overstock is currently the largest provider of private employment in Afghanistan. According to Mariam Nawabi, commercial attaché for the Afghan Embassy in the United States, Overstock is currently believed to provide employment, directly or indirectly, for about 1,700 people living in Afghanistan.   Prior to Overstock's arrival, Byrne was told that the country's largest employer was a brick factory in the Western city of Herat, which had about 400 workers.  'That was the (General Electric) of Afghanistan before we got there,' said Byrne, who traveled to Afghanistan in March. 'Now we're the GE.'   Byrne's operation in Afghanistan is strictly low-tech. The company's suppliers largely work from home. Their chief products are rugs, embroidery, jewelry and fur-lined clothing.  Afghanistan is one of more than 30 countries that sell handmade goods for Overstock, and it is currently the site's largest foreign supplier. Rugs, according to Kanishka, are the top-selling item, ranging in price from around $200 to $1,700.   Overstock isn't the only one attempting to profit online by selling handmade goods from exotic locations. Competitors include retailers specializing in single-product categories as well as sites like Novica, an online venture backed by the National Geographic Society that sells crafts from a network of more than 2,000 artists around the globe.   The principle behind the business, said Roberto Milk, Novica's co-founder and chief executive, is to give people who traditionally sold their wares only at markets near their homes a chance to reach a much bigger group of potential buyers.   'For people who work with us, their economic situation changes because they have an ongoing way to sell to the world market,' Milk said.   But Novica isn't a nonprofit venture. Milk estimates that the site's revenues are growing at a rate of 30 percent annually and he expects it to become profitable in the second half of the year.   Like Worldstock, Novica's wares span several continents. Suppliers include leatherworkers from the Andes, carvers from West Africa, basket weavers from Bali and Java, and painters from all locations.  Other online retailers are venturing even farther off the beaten path to seek out handmade goods.   Pete Burris, president and namesake of Alpaca Pete's, a retail chain and website that sells rugs and clothes made from the woolly South American alpaca, buys finished products almost exclusively from a group of about 4,000 Peruvians from the island of Amantani, located in the middle of Lake Titicaca, the highest-elevation lake in the world. Aside from a small tourism business, Burris says, his Alpaca exports constitute one of the only local sources of employment.   In Afghanistan, Kaniskha's network of suppliers consists largely of women who were prevented from working outside their homes under the Taliban regime. These days, many of these women make substantially more money than men.  Given the disparity between prevailing wages in developed and developing nations, both Overstock's Byrne and Novica's Milk say their goal is not to get the lowest possible price for handmade goods.   At Novica, Milk said, artists themselves set wholesale prices for the retailer, which are usually at least slightly higher than local prices.   On its website, Overstock says that it will not make a profit of more than 1 percent on goods sold through its Worldstock division. In practice, Byrne said, this translates into artisans receiving about $70 from every $100 customers spend on their wares.   By American standards, earnings for suppliers of handmade goods don't seem like much to rejoice about. Kanishka cites the example of one mother and six daughters who make about $400 a month embroidering shawls. In Afghanistan, where government workers commonly earn less than $40 a month, Kanishka insists, 'that's big money.'

The ISP’s claim that the USD30,000 ISP license fee required by the NCA is a big impediment to them rolling out services more widely locally. The ISP’s say the huge fees is a major reason for the slow pace of Internet growth in northern Ghana, as not many businesses would like to invest in Internet services in the North where the market is relatively small. The ISPs made the appeal during a Technical Update Seminar organised by the International Institute of Communication and Development, IICD, Centre for Information Technology Research and Development (CITRED) and Ghana information Network for Knowledge Sharing (GINKS). The aim of the seminar was to share information with the residents of the Northern region on connectivity options available in the world today and how best as a community they can develop and promote the region into the knowledge based economy using Information and Communication Technology tools. Ernest Kofie, Director of GrasRut, a cybercafé and ISP operator in Tamale, said considering the high cost of Internet usage to most of the people of Tamale, his ISP has adopted a community approach to the deployment of Internet in Tamale. He was therefore very agitated by the requirement of NCA to pay USD 30, 000 license fees as paid by all ISPs in Ghana. He pleaded to the NCA to have some waivers for ISP’s who decide to operate outside of Accra. Jonnie Akakpo of CITRED introduced new technologies to the participants and said it was important that the government take the new ICT4AD policy seriously and implement its recommendations to the letter. Denise Clarke of IICD introduced the Bgan Mobile IP Satellite Technology as one of the possible connectivity options for rural areas. She was of the view that such connectivity tools where relatively cheap and afforded people in the rural areas to also have access to the benefits of Internet. Kofi Mangesi of GINKS encouraged the community to continue to dialogue on how best they can influence policy in the area of connectivity.

A key sign of improvement will be the signing, after years of haggling, of a final accord on the compatibility and inter-operability of the two blocs' rival GPS and Galileo satellite navigation systems.  For a long time, the US was not overly keen on what it saw as an unnecessary rival to its own GPS system. However, Europe went ahead, is building Galileo's first satellites, signing international agreements with Russia, India, Brazil, Mexico and China, and is set to be operational by 2008.  The EU-US agreement should reap benefits for both the US and Europe in a highly competitive satellite positioning market forecast to reach EUR 300 billion globally by 2020. Galileo is expected not only to create some 150,000 jobs in Europe, but also to herald a technological revolution comparable to that of the mobile phone.

European Commissioner for regional policy Jacques Barrot said in a statement that the programmes 'will help to bridge the significant gaps in the enlarged European Union and contribute to integration and to territorial cohesion'.  When the European Union grew to 25 members on May 1, its population increased by 20 percent but its gross national product rose only five percent, highlighting the development gap between the previous 15 members and the 10 new members.  The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said that efforts would in particular be made so that countries benefitting from the aid would have the administrative capacity to manage the funds.  About 15 billion euros were targeted at the poorest regions, defined as areas having gross domestic product equivalent to 75 percent of the EU average.  Poland, the biggest new EU member, would receive 8.2 billion euros, the biggest share of the aid, followed by Hungary with 1.9 billion euros, the Czech Republic with 1.45 billion euros, Slovakia with 1.041 billion euros, Lithuania with 895 million euros, Latvia with 626 million euros, Estonia with 371 million euros, Slovenia with 237 million euros, Malta with 63 million euros and Cyprus with 53 million euros  Source;  EU sources, June 04  Author;  LuisB    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   FOCUS    TELECOMMUNICATIONS – CORPORATE OVERVIEW   SA’s Telkom continues to make high profits    Telkom last week announced strong group annual results for the year ended March 31, 2004, with healthy increases in operating revenue and operating profit, positive cash flow growth, and excellent growth in both headline and basic earnings per share. The group financial highlights for 2004 include: -8,8% group revenue growth to R40, 795bn;  - 39,5% growth in operating profit to R9,088bn;  - 40% group Ebitda margin;  - Group return on assets of 18%;  - Net debt to equity of 61%;  - Total dividend of 200 cents per share paid for the year. Commenting on the results, Group CEO of Telkom, Sizwe Nxasana, says: 'The management of the Telkom Group is pleased to report strong results in our first full year as a listed company that has seen us execute well on strategy and deliver growing returns to our shareholders. 'Group operational highlights include the Telkom Group achieving robust operational performance across all levels of the business, with delivery against its three strategic pillars of customer growth and retention, operational efficiencies and innovation and sustaining the development of the marketplace.'   Key achievements include:   - 14% growth of data revenue, 44% growth in Internet subscribers, 17% growth in ISDN channels and 661% growth in ADSL subscribers;  - The launch of VPN Supreme;  - Growth of voicemail accounts to nearly one million. Value-added fixed-line voice packages penetrate 64% of residential customer base;  - The introduction of new fixed-line calling plans, like Xtratime;  - The winning of 14 international call centre customers;  - The introduction of on-line ordering, payments and billing;  - Re-branded TelkomDirect retail outlets;  - The distribution deal with Vodashop;  - Property development deals to ensure upfront communications availability;  - Mobile customer growth of 30% to 11,2m customers with contract customer growth of 20%;  - Mobile gross connections of 6m, compared to 4m in the prior year;  - African mobile customer growth of 93%;  - Mobile data revenue growth of 59%.  Nxasana adds, 'Telkom aggressively promoted data products to the consumer and SMME markets through campaigns in the past financial year, which advanced the group’s strategy of becoming the data provider of choice.'   The increase in revenue growth was said to be mainly due to higher demand for data services in the medium and small business segment, with leased line revenue growing by 17,7%, which was offset by a 2,2% decrease in mobile leased facilities revenue, due to network optimisation initiatives by the mobile operators. There has also been a stringent focus on key business imperatives. The execution of group strategy helped Telkom SA to grow headline earnings per share by 175% to 863,6 cents, from 314 cents in its first full year as a listed company.  The group declared a final dividend of 110c per share, thanks to sustained revenue from traditional voice services and market endorsement of value-added data and mobile services. Telkom’s strategy to defend core revenues and enhance operating efficiencies lifted group operating revenue by 8,8% to R40,795bn (2003: R37,507bn).  Basic earnings per share grew by 177,5% to 812 cents (2003: 292,6 cents) through a 39,5% increase in operating profit to R9,088bn (2003: R6,514bn)and a reduction of finance charges, which included net losses of R776m arising from measuring derivates at fair value and currency volatility. Ebitda margins expanded to 40% from 35%, underpinning the generation of strong cash flows.  Telkom advanced on its stated plan to contain net debt to equity within a 50 - 70% range. Net debt decreased by 33,8% to R13,362bn (2003: R20,171bn), bringing the net debt to equity ratio to 60,6%, compared to 109,9% in the previous period. Group capital expenditure decreased by 7,1%, and represented 13% of group revenue, in line with the group’s guidance of maintaining capital expenditure in the range of 12 to 15% of group revenues.  The mobile segment accounted for 25% of group operating revenue, driven largely by customer growth that is evident in a decrease in contract churn. 'Telkom has also allocated R7,7m in its 2004/05 financial year to programmes designed to control the HIV/Aids pandemic,' Nxasana adds. Telkom’s strategy is to enhance education campaigns and to offer voluntary counselling, testing and treatment for affected staff across the country. Telkom estimates HIV/Aids prevalence at 9,6% within its workplace, which is considerably lower than the country’s estimate of 26,5%.  Nxasana says, 'People are Telkom’s most important competitive asset, and are key to it being an efficient and cost-effective group. The group has implemented a strategic human capital management plan, which seeks to protect and nurture its people. Telkom’s people are driving operational efficiencies and innovation within the group, and are the people behind customer retention.'  Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) also underpins Telkom’s drive for sustainability. Telkom has advanced its strategy, which elevates BEE as a crucial growth imperative for Telkom, by directing R5bn to BEE suppliers in the 2004 financial year. And, in its efforts to contribute to the development of a broad-based black middle class, Telkom created an estimated R560m in value for over 100 000 retail shareholders, who subscribed to Telkom’s Initial Public Offering (IPO). Telkom has also proceeded with a socially responsible approach to headcount reductions, which has been boosted by the Agency for Career Opportunities. This is an initiative to help employees, often through re-skilling, to become re-employed either internally or externally.  Telkom reduced its fixed-line headcount by 8,5% (excluding subsidiaries) to 32 358 in the 2004 financial year, with only 3,6% of losses being involuntary retrenchments. Telkom aims to reduce employee numbers on an annual basis by 7 to 10% per annum, including natural attrition. This will be largely enabled through the Operational Support Systems (OSS) initiative, which aims to provide automated solutions to enhance revenue and reduce costs. Already, increased employee productivity has been reflected in growth from 137 to 149 lines per employee.

"        HIGHLIGHTS   INDIA – ECONOMY   India goes cool on privatisation    India's new government has scrapped key elements of its predecessor's privatisation programme.   The communist-backed coalition, led by the Congress party, said in a policy statement that it would not sell off profitable state-run firms.  Privatisations of loss-making firms would be decided 'case-by-case'.  Last week, Indian share prices posted a near-record slump amid fears that the new coalition would reverse the BJP government's economic reforms.  The prospect of slower progress on reform has also spooked foreign investors, who have sold some $800m worth of Indian shares so far this month.  Privatising some of India's profitable state enterprises in the energy and heavy engineering industries formed a central plank of the BJP government's economic agenda.    Fiscal pressure   The new government's policy document pledged to raise spending on education to 6% of gross domestic product, and to encourage more foreign investment in the oil and energy sector.  It also set a target for annual growth of between 7 and 8%.  Economists said the new coalition's economic blueprint could put India's already overstretched public finances under added pressure.  'How will the increased spending on education be funded?' said Kishlaya Pathak, economist at Standard Chartered Bank.  'This is crucial because our fiscal situation is a matter of concern.'  India's central government deficit stands at about 5% of gross domestic product, prompting warnings that the country must do more to balance its books.  There are fears that without the proceeds of further privatisations, or deep public spending cuts, the budget black hole could widen sharply.  Cutting public spending - much of it in the form of politically sensitive subsidies and non-negotiable interest payments on public debt - has proved an unpalatable option for most Indian governments.    Markets calm   Bombay's leading share index closed half a percentage point lower on Thursday shortly before the new policy agenda was unveiled, but analysts said the market would take the news in its stride when it reopened on Friday.  'The market has already reacted to the likely slowdown in reforms,' said K K Mittal, fund manager at Escorts Mutual Fund in New Delhi.  The economic policy agenda was thrashed out in talks between the Congress party, the senior partner in the new coalition, and its allies, which include two communist parties.   The new coalition, entitled the United Progressive Alliance, won a surprise election victory two weeks ago over the BJP government.  Led by Manmohan Singh, a former Indian finance minister, the United Progressive Alliance won the contest thanks to the support of poor rural voters.  They felt the BJP's economic reforms had enriched an urban elite without delivering tangible improvements to the broad mass of the Indian people.  Analysts said the acid test for the new government's economic policies would come later this year, when it unveils detailed tax and spending plans in its first budget.  But the appointment of Mr Singh - the architect of a highly successful economic overhaul during the mid-1990s - as prime minister has helped soothe investors' nerves.  Mr Singh was named prime minister last week after Congress party leader, Sonia Ghandi, declined to take on the role.

Export, for instance, grew by 14 percent in the Philippines, 7 percent in Malaysia and Indonesia, 5 percent in Singapore, and 22 percent in Thailand. Plus, China and ASEAN countries' related trade negotiations ended ahead of schedule with extensive consensus reached. This shows the '10+1' Free Trade Area jointly advocated by China and ASEAN has made a big way ahead and is full of vigor.  ASEAN countries are China's neighbors and developing countries as well. Developing mutually beneficial cooperation with ASEAN and seeking for long-term stable development in relations with ASEAN is in line with China's interest and beneficial to the overall revitalization of Asia.   In recent years, mutual political trust constantly strengthened, economic exchanges increasingly grew and cooperation turned more and more fruitful. Bilateral trade between China and ASEAN has been growing by 15 percent since 1995. In 2003, it grew by 40 percent to a new high of US$ 78.2 billion, in which China imported US$ 47.3 billion from ASEAN, a 50 percent rise. Presently, ASEAN has become China's fifth largest trade partner, and China the sixth of the ASEAN.   The 'early harvest' plan under the framework of China-ASEAN Free Trade Area implemented in January 2004 further pushed trade growth in Asia. For Thailand alone, Sino-Thai trade heralded in agricultural produce. Since China and Thailand initiated zero tariffs for vegetable and fruit on October 1, 2003, such trade rose rapidly. It has not only greatly promoted bilateral trade, but also provided new commercial opportunities for the enterprises of the two countries with materialized benefit.   Statistics show, in January to March 2004, vegetable trade between the two countries totaled US$ 114 million, in which China exported to Thailand commodities worth of US$ 13.98 million, a year-on-year rise of 87.84 percent, meanwhile China imported from Thailand US$ 99.63 million, a year-on-year growth of 143.42 percent. Official with Thai Ministry of Commerce said that Thailand is actively pushing free trade in other commodities, and is striving to realize zero tariffs in fish and milk products in 2004, and industrial products in 2005. Currently, national economies of China and Thailand have been growing fast, bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation intensified.   China's sustained and fast economic growth maintains a vigorous momentum of interregional trade in Asia. It is predicted at the ASEAN Finance Ministers' Meeting in Singapore on April 7 that the average economic growth rate in ASEAN countries will be 5.05-5.09 percent. Singapore scholar held, for ASEAN countries, to establish China-ASEAN Free Trade Area is conducive to catching up with China's economic high-speed train and to making sure that the ASEAN continue to play the role as an important economic zone. This is agreeable to its own interest.   Negotiations on China-ASEAN Free Trade Area started early 2002. In November 2002, the two sides signed framework agreement on economic cooperation, and decided to realize step-by-step free trade with zero tariffs. According to 'early harvest' plan, over 500 kinds of commodities, mainly agricultural produces, will have reduced duties and to zero by 2006. Till 2010 when China-ASEAN Free Trade Area is established, there will be an economic area with 1.7 billion consumers, a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of two trillion, US$ 120 million economic aggregate. It will be the most populous free trade area, the largest one composed of developing countries.   In spite of a wide gap in economic development, different economic development stages among the ASEAN members, as well as their goals and acceptability, challenges will be conquered and mutual benefit realized as long as the two sides have negotiations with equality, seek common grounds while shelve the differences. Just as Indonesian President Megawati Soekarnoputri put it, ASEAN-China cooperation has growing increasingly mature, and it is hoped that the dialogue partnership in trade, investment, technological cooperation, culture and society can be further enhanced to promote regional stability and prosperity.   Now China-ASEAN cooperation has made a breakthrough with marked harvest: the trade volume between China and Thailand in the first quarter of 2004 alone has exceeded US$ 3.8 billion. Singapore Deputy Prime minister Lee Hsien Loong stressed in his recent visit to China, the agreement on free trade area is a significant step forward and Singapore will have negotiations with China on free trade in 2004 to further push '10+1' Free Trade Area. With regard to the prospect, China-ASEAN Free Trade Area will be sure to maintain a constantly fast pace forward.

The issues supposed to dominate the two-day meeting and show how Nato is finding a role in the post cold war era are turning out to be uncomfortable.  In Afghanistan, the 26-member alliance is hard-pressed to provide a medical corps or a few transport helicopters for the 6,500-strong Nato-led International Security Assistance Force.  Its ambitions to develop its own Greater Middle East Policy have been lowered as Washington dilutes its grand plans for the region. Summit invitations to leaders from north Africa and the Middle East have been dropped. Discussion over Nato's future role in Iraq will also be limited, as world leaders focus on the handover of sovereignty two days later. So it is hardly surprising that the atmosphere at alliance headquarters in Brussels is gloomy.  But Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, 56, the Dutch politician who last January took over the helm of Nato, is not. As secretary-general, he seems determined to make a virtue out of necessity at Istanbul.  'There is no room for gloom,' he says in a Financial Times interview. Indeed, Mr de Hoop Scheffer intends to raise more uncomfortable issues in Turkey, using the example of Afghanistan, Nato's first 'out of area' mission, to spell out his plans for transforming the alliance. One is the military planning for missions, the other is how they are financed.  When Nato agrees on a mission, military planners call for 'a force generation' conference where nations are asked what they can provide. Separately, Nato's overall 'force planning system' has a huge inventory of helicopters, tanks, troops and aircraft. None, however, is immediately available for specific missions.  'It is not easy to generate forces,' says Mr de Hoop Scheffer. 'There is a dis-connect between the force planning system and the way we generate our forces. When we enter into the political commitment, we have to know what forces we can generate to honour that commitment.'  In an ideal world, some Nato military officers would like a nation to commit a fixed set of capabilities, allowing the planners easy access. As a former foreign minister, Mr de Hoop Scheffer knows this is unrealistic.  'Sending out forces to missions is always a decision that involves national sovereignty,' he explains. 'If we can find a solution between the disconnect of force planning and force generation, we will not deny the Dutch, the Poles or anyone else [the right] to make their national decisions.' The secretary-general says a review of how missions are financed might bridge the gap between the big, elusive toolbox and what nations actually contribute for peacekeeping missions.  Missions are financed on the basis of 'costs lie where they fall', with each nation responsible for all equipment and personnel it deploys abroad. 'The 'costs lie where they fall' is a principle that should be fundamentally discussed because it means certain nations that always have the assets will always be asked to deliver,' says Mr de Hoop Scheffer.  He would, for example, like to see more common funding for the essential capabilities Nato needs for most missions: heavy airlift, transport helicopters and medical facilities - exactly the shortfalls in Afghanistan. A dozen or so nations finance Nato's Awacs, the early warning airborne control system. And a handful of European countries are funding the A400m heavy transport aircraft.  'We need to think more about common funding. We have to try to be inventive,' says Mr de Hoop Scheffer. The structure of defence budgets are another problem. 'Some countries have one defence budget from which you have to finance peacekeeping operations and new weapons systems. I think. . Peacekeeping operations should not be charged to the defence budget,' he says. He does not expect Istanbul to deliver such ambitious aims. Instead, with Afghanistan as the catalyst and the big test for Nato's ability to operate out of area, he hopes to get the green light to start debate.

At the same time, participants in the new group openly hope it develops into an opposition vehicle that can mount a challenge President Askar Akayev’s hold on political power.   The group, calling itself the Union for Fair Elections (UFE), came into being May 20. At its core are several prominent opposition parties, including Ar-Namys (Honor), led by jailed Akayev rival Feliks Kulov, and the Social Democrats. Although dominated by the opposition, UFE leaders sought to portray the union as having a middle-of-the-road agenda. People’s Party leader Melis Eshimkanov, for instance, said the union would strive to act as “a third political force between the authorities and the opposition,” according to a report by the KyrgyzInfo news agency.   Perhaps the most surprising UFE participant is Misir Ashirkulov, who had been a member of the president’s inner circle of advisors. Ashirkulov was reputedly a leading centrist in Akayev’s administration, who, during the height of political tension in 2002, reportedly counseled that the president take a conciliatory approach toward the opposition. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. His decision to join UFE suggests that he lost a struggle against hardliners within the administration for control over the administration’s policy agenda. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive].   “Today we are uniting for real action, with good intentions, despite differences in our political views or party platforms,” said a UFE statement issued May 20. “We are ready to cooperate with all citizens who share our thoughts, aspirations and our position.” The appearance of the fair election union creates a headache for Akayev, who has come under fire in recent years for abandoning a democratic reform course. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. A report by the AKIpress news agency on May 25 said that Akayev, during a meeting with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Lynn Pascoe in Bishkek, complained about the US assessment of democratic reforms. The president told Pascoe that “Kyrgyzstan needed more balanced coverage and due assessment by US official structures,” the AKIpress report said.   Akayev’s democratic image was not helped by his May 24 decision to relieve Ashirkulov of his duties as Security Council chief. Presidential aides insisted the move was not related to Ashirkulov’s UFE move. Most local observers, however, believe Ashirkulov’s dismissal was an act of political retribution.  The biggest question surrounding the upcoming presidential election in 2005 is whether or not Akayev will seek a third term. Akayev has repeatedly said he intends to retire, but he has left room to change his mind. [For additional information see the Eurasia Insight archive].   Kyrgyzstan’s presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000 were criticized as flawed by international observers. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. Opposition leaders firmly believe that in a free and fair vote, they could win control of both the executive and legislative branches of government. Some participants say the UFE is designed to promote opposition unity with the specific goal of nominating a single candidate to run in the presidential election.   A variety of factors – including North-South sectional differences -- have helped keep the opposition divided to date. Akayev has often exploited the opposition’s fractious nature in his efforts to defend his political supremacy.   'We should be united to mobilize the electorate,' Emil Aliyev, deputy leader of Ar-Namys, said in an interview with EurasiaNet. 'Right now, there is a search for a leader. Possible candidates and their qualities are being discussed. It is important that the leader should be independent and should not be under pressure from other forces.'  'We count on winning the elections if they are fair,' continued Aliyev. 'But I do not exclude that before the elections and during them unwanted candidates would be removed physically.'   Given the uncertainty surrounding Akayev’s potential candidacy, some UFE members are hoping the opposition can get a jump on the presidential campaign. 'The government does not have a distinguished person who could win the presidential elections in the first round,' said parliamentary deputy Adahan Madumarov. 'Therefore, the opposition is already [working towards] putting forward a common candidate. If we achieve that, we could demonstrate our power to authorities and to the people.'  Many political observers believe the unified opposition’s candidate could turn out to be Ashirkulov. Other possible candidates include parliamentary deputy Kurmanbek Bakiyev, along with Madumarov and Omurbek Tekebaev.   Some observers suggest Bakiyev, a former Prime Minister, could be acceptable to Akayev as a “compromise candidate.' Others doubt that Bakiyev enjoys much support in the presidential administration. One analyst stressed the sectional divide, pointing out that Bakiyev is a southerner while northerners dominate Akayev’s inner circle. A southerner’s rise to the presidency could unleash fresh, clan-driven political conflicts, the expert said. 'They [Akayev’s aides] do not want a stranger entering their garden,' the analyst explained. '[T] Hey would have to share influence, posts and property.”   Source;  Eurasianet, May 04  Write;  by Aigul Rasulova is a freelance writer based in Bishkek.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   NEW ZELAND – SOCIAL AFFAIRS   Government plans to build another 1000 state houses     The Government plans to build another 1054 State homes and make improvements to another 856 with money set aside in today's Budget.   The Budget allocates $128.9 million over the next three years to Housing New Zealand Corporation to acquire new State houses.  This takes the total for next year for the purchase of new State homes to $232m.  The Government said details would be announced next week but the money would be spent buying 1054 homes and making improvements to another 856 houses for State tenants.  In 2003/04, some $320m was available to acquire housing stock and modernise existing homes.  Housing Minister Steve Maharey also today said further funding of $4.8m was being provided in 2004/05 to continue to repair substandard housing in Northland, East Coast and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.  The Ministry of Housing was getting $3.4m to extend the Residential Tenancies Act to boarding houses once legislation currently before Parliament was passed.  The Act defines the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants and sets out disputes resolution processes.  It will be reviewed with $700,000 allocated in the budget.  The ministry will use some of the $3.4m funding allocation to better inform landlords and tenants about trends in the rental market.  A database, costing $1.3m to set up, would allow people to access information about past Tenancy Tribunal decisions.

Pertamina's expenditures currently are surpassing its income due to its obligation to meet domestic fuel oil demand with fuel oil bought on the international market at sharply inflated prices, a spokesman said.   'With a liquidity position below 2 trillion rupiah [US$215 million], the company is already bleeding,' Pertamina's director of finance, Alfred Rohimone, told a hearing on Tuesday with the House of Representatives' commission on mines and energy.   At the end of April, Pertamina had cash reserves of less than $215 million, but the company's costs for importing crude oil and fuel products exceeded $540 million per month. The company's policy of making cash advance payments to purchase crude oil have also added to its loss of cash flow, Rohimone said.   As a result, the company, which imports some 300,000 barrels of crude oil and fuel products a day at international market prices, is on the brink of running a deficit, and has asked the Indonesian government to help it avert a crisis.   The country's current state budget has allocated some Rp14.5 trillion in fuel subsidies to Pertamina, based on an assumption of oil priced at an average of $22 per barrel. Pertamina should receive subsidy compensation for that entire amount, Alfred said, but in practice, with payments being spread over 12 months, the company only receives 70 percent of the total compensation.   At present, crude oil prices are hovering at a record high of more than $40 per barrel, and the government is scheduled to submit a revision to the 2004 state budget to the House of Representatives as early as July. At that level, according to Pertamina, the fuel subsidy could nearly triple to some Rp40 trillion ($4.35 billion), causing a larger deficit.   Pertamina has already had to spend Rp40 billion to buy crude oil at the price of $35 per barrel, Rohimone said. As a further consequence of the price rise, it has used Rp3.6 trillion of its monthly fee to the government to buy oil, he added.   'Pertamina must cover any shortage in payment with its own funds, Rohimone said. 'But under the present unfavorable financial circumstances, the company may no longer be able to do so.'   According to Rohimone, the company's current financial condition is largely linked to the previous management's policy of spending a huge amount of money to pay debts. The company had cash reserves of Rp23 trillion ($2.5 billion) in 2001, but said they were depleted through the repayment of government loans.   'The previous management in 2002 spent a lot of money to pay debts on several long-term projects. As a result, we are now broke,' Rohimone said.   The lack of operating revenue has forced Pertamina to cancel several projects, and the company said it may liquidate three money-losing subsidiaries as part of its program to improve efficiency.   Pertamina has 14 wholly owned subsidiaries in various business areas including non-oil sectors. But based on an evaluation of the 14 companies, three of the subsidiaries will be liquidated and three others merged into other, better performing companies, Pertamina President Ariffi Nawawi said.   Pertamina also has decided to delay planned exploration activity in Iraq's Western Desert field until the United States has handed over legal and sovereign power to an Iraqi authority.  'We heard that the transfer of power will take place in June 2004. We will wait until this has happened,' Pertamina's director of Downstream Industries, Bambang Nugroho, said on the sidelines of the meeting on Tuesday.   Pertamina had planned to begin its exploration activity in the Western Desert field in Iraq in March, but due to increased tensions in Iraq and reports that the US would hand over power to Iraqis, it has decided to postpone the plan's execution.   The company's losses, on top of costs that have exceeded government subsidies, have worsened Pertamina's economic health.   As a result, finance director Rohimone has forwarded several alternatives to the government to help overcome the company's rising deficit. Among them is a request for the government to pay Pertamina its marketing fee on time and to pay Pertamina the fuel oil subsidy compensation funds in advance, based on the actual price and calculations of asset reappraisals.   Rohimone has also asked that the government take over the company's obligation to pay tax and duties on public service operations.   'Short-term measures to cope with the financial crisis in Pertamina would be to release funds from the escrow account, a clear marketing fee [and] on-time payment of subsidy,' Rohimone said. 'A long-term solution would be improving the structure of the fuel oil price.'   In addition, he said the company should review new investment projects, especially those that burden its cash flow.

Higher personal consumption ahead of the May 10 national elections and modest growth in private sector investments also contributed to the better-than-expected expansion in the country’s gross domestic product. Analysts had expected output in the first three months to rise by only 4.7 per cent. From the previous quarter, GDP grew by 2.2 per cent, the highest since the first quarter of 1999, according to the National Statistics Coordination Board, the government agency that compiles the national economic accounts.  President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who is leading in the presidential elections by a slim margin according to unofficial tabulations of the vote, welcomed news that the economy did well in the first quarter.  The strong economic performance 'show that our economic policies and strategies are working,' she said in a statement. But the data failed to cheer stock market investors who were worried that higher gas prices and transport fares might prompt the central bank to raise interest rates during the monetary board’s rate-setting meeting next week. Share prices in the Philippines on Thursday fell by 0.57 per cent. Romulo Virola, the government’s chief statistician, said economic growth in the first quarter was broadly based. Almost half of the 6.4 per cent GDP growth was contributed by services while 1.8 percentage points came from industry and 1.6 percentage points came from agriculture. He said investments in call centres and other business process outsourcing facilities have begun to pay off.  Mr Virola also said that first quarter farm output, which grew at its fastest in 15 years, benefited from good weather as well as recent government programmes to modernise the agriculture and fisheries sectors. He said rice production has been going up because of the introduction of new, higher-yielding hybrid varieties and the rehabilitation of irrigation facilities.

The two national flag carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, were reported to have recently asked the ministry for permission to gradually add $2-$13 in surcharges to international flight fares if oil prices continue to rise.  The ministry said it is difficult to approve the request. But it has recommended the airlines increase market prices of air tickets, which are usually lower than permitted prices.   The airline companies plan to apply for permission again.   In March, the ministry had approved a hike in the ceiling of the ticket prices for international flights flown by the two national flag carriers by up to 7.7 percent.  Domestic flight fares will also increase starting July 16. Adjustment in domestic flight fares is totally up to airline companies, which are only required to notify the ministry of changes 20 days before the implementation.  Korean Air announced it will raise the fares by 8 percent for weekend flights and 13 percent for flights during high-demand seasons. It will also combine discounts for middle school students, high school students, and university students, into a single discount for youth between 13- and 22-years-old.    Asiana Airlines is not considering a raise in flight fares yet.   The fare raise plan has resulted from soaring crude oil prices. The average oil price for aircrafts during January to April has increased by 22 percent to $40.3 per barrel from $33 last year.   The ratio of oil costs among the total expenses of air companies was 18 percent for Korean Air and 21 percent for Asiana Airlines last year. If the oil price increases by $1 per barrel, Korean Air may shoulder an additional $25 million with Asiana Airlines assuming $13 million.  The high-speed train, which started running April 1, is another factor for flight fare increases, as passengers to and from Kimpo Airport to local airports in Kimhae, Taegu, Kwangju, and Mokpo declined by 35.2 percent to 412,000 in April from 635,000 a year ago.  The total number of flights has also decreased, with Asiana Airline reducing the number of flights between Kimpo and Kimhae from 16 to 11 per week, and between Kimpo and Taegu from eight to two.   ``To promote air industry and attract more passengers, we reduced the time for security checks by placing more monitoring machines, and cut the fees for parking lots at Kimpo Airport. We’ll also prepare business rooms in the airports as well as set a special department specifically for services such as cutting the waiting time for baggage,’’ a Korea Airports Corporation official said.

One side is the comfortable middle class.  The other - tucked into alleyways or barren lots - are slums that look like a scene out of Mad Max: low-roofed tin huts; wild-haired children walking naked. For centuries, these two worlds have been symbiotic. Slums provide housecleaners, cooks, and drivers for the middle class. The middle class, meanwhile, tolerates the slums as a source of cheap labor.  But this system is buckling under the pressure of India's burgeoning urban population, particularly over issues of health. Urban slums are the fastest-growing sector of India's population, expanding five times faster than rural areas. How the government deals with this problem could have widespread implications, both for the country's ability to attract foreign investors and to convince upwardly mobile citizens that life is safe enough to remain in India.  'When you analyze the urban slums and the statistics that slums will be growing at faster rates than other [areas], this is a serious concern,' says Prasan Kumar Hota, secretary of family welfare in the Indian Health Ministry. Urbanization is a global phenomenon. In wealthier nations, most citizens already live in major urban areas or suburbs. But for poorer countries, the epic migration of villagers to cities is straining clean water supplies, sewer systems, and hospitals. Of the roughly 2 billion people to be added to the world's population over the next 30 years, more than 90 percent will be living in the cities and towns of poor countries, according to The Challenge of Slums, a recent report by the UN agency Habitat.  In India, there is a cruel twist. Decades of rural programs have brought clinics and healthcare to villagers. But now villagers are often leaving behind better healthcare in search of better jobs. In a recent survey in the state of Gujarat, for example, researchers found that 60 percent of surveyed villages had vaccinated their children, compared with 30 percent of slum dwellers.  A small collection of government bureaucrats, private volunteer groups, and feisty community leaders are starting to address the imbalance, one slum at a time. Here in Indore, an innovative pilot program - funded by USAID and run by private healthcare advocacy groups - is helping slum dwellers improve their own health conditions. With limited funding, this program chose 75 of the most vulnerable slums (out of 543), and focused first on education. 'The most important thing is to deal with the sense of resignation that you find among most Indian slums,' says Siddharth Agarwal, executive director of Environmental Health Project (EHP), a private aid group in New Delhi leading the Indore project. 'These people should be the implementers. We may be wonderful doctors, but we will disappear one day, so if a program is able to train five people in that community, then the effort can be sustained.' Training includes lessons on good nutrition, safer birthing methods, better sanitation, proper disposal of waste products, and proper hygiene, such as washing hands before food preparation. Some slum dwellers are learning how to demand access to drinking water and affordable health clinics.  The irony, says Mr. Hota, is that both politicians and villagers assume that the issue of urban healthcare will just resolve itself. 'Somehow we all expect that urban poor, with higher incomes, higher number of doctors and hospitals, should be able to take care of themselves. But that is not true.'  In fact, says Mr. Agarwal, 71 percent of the slum dwellers in Indore go to private doctors, 'many of whom are not licensed, and all of whom are expensive.' In Professor's Colony here in Indore - a neighborhood of modern concrete homes near the university - a band of women - middle-aged, poor, and barely literate - are educating themselves now on how to prevent health problems. Every few weeks, they meet with tutors from EHP in an effort to prevent illnesses that can devastate a poor family. During hot afternoons, during times that used to be reserved for gossip, the women share what they learn with other women in the area. Tara Bai, a 60-year-old who came to Indore 30 years ago, has learned more about childbirth in the last year than in all her life. Before, improper practices in washing babies after birth meant that more than half would die overnight from hypothermia. Before, mothers didn't use a sterilized string to tie the umbilical cord; many children died of infections.  Today, infant mortality in Tara Bai's slum has dropped dramatically. 'We've had 8 to 10 births so far this year, and no deaths,' she says. Her hut has become a meeting place of sorts for the 100 families of this slum. 'If God gives light to you, you should know how to use that light.' Best of all, Tara Bai says, this education is portable. So if city officials carry out threats to remove this slum, Tara Bai says, 'I know how to go to a new slum and organize it; I can do it again.'  Across town, in a slum at the city's scruffy edges, Shanta Bai (unrelated to Tara) has also been taking courses in healthcare, and improving the lives of her neighbors. (Bai is a common last name for Indian women here; it means wife in Hindi.) Shanta Bai comes from one of the poorest communities in Hindu society, the caste of rag pickers, who collect and sort trash for recycling. She's illiterate, but acts as a community pillar. 'This slum has been moved three times in 15 years,' she says, adding that she was born into an Indore slum 60 years ago. 'But there is a support system here. We look out for each other.'  She says her training has made her better prepared. 'Before the class, I was blind. I would never have realized ... that we could do all this together,' she says.

"        HIGHLIGHTS    INDONESIA – POLITICS   Indonesia: Fragile Democracy   Presidential candidates 2004   Indonesians will head to the polls again on July 5 for the country's first direct presidential election. If no candidate gets the required 50 per cent plus one of the national vote, a second round of elections will be held in September. That round would require only a simple majority for victory.  There are five candidates in the poll: Megawati Sukarnoputri; Wiranto; Hamzah Haz, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; and Amien Rais.    Megawati Sukarnoputri  - Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) The staunchly nationalist Megawati Sukarnoputri rose to the presidency in July 2001, as the vice president who replaced ousted president Abdurrahman Wahid.  The daugher of independence hero Sukarno took power with a promise to bring stability to the country as it emerged from decades of authorcratic rule. However, faced with the task of bringing about reform in the wake of the Suharto era, a struggling economy, ethnic tension and the rise of Islamic extremism, Megawati's presidency has garnered mixed reviews. She has been accused of uncommunicative leadership and insufficient action against graft and a faltering economy. In the April 5 legislative polls, Megawati's Democratic Party of Struggle Indonesia (PDI-P) won only 109 seats, compared with 153 in 1999, and she is trailing her former security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, as favourite for president. Megawati has picked the leader of Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Hasyim Muzadi, as her vice-presidential candidate to broaden her appeal. However, analysts predict she faces a tough fight against both Yudhoyono and Golkar's candidate, Wiranto.   Wiranto  – Golkar Former defence minister and Indonesian military chief, Wiranto, surprised many when he was nominated as the Golkar Party's presidential candidate, ahead of the party's own chairman, Akbar Tanjung. Wiranto, 57, has emerged from retirement to run the presidential race and has promised stability, security and strong leadership for Indonesia. Wiranto, who is renowned for his love of singing, has vowed to serve only one term as president if he wins the election.  The former general is facing an arrest warrant by an East Timor judicial body over charges - which he denies - of crimes against humanity related to violence that erupted during the territory's split from Indonesian rule in 1999. International human rights groups have opposed the selection of Wirtanto as Golkar's candidate. However, foreign governments, including East Timor, say they will respect the democratic process in Indonesia and work with the him if he wins the presidency. Wiranto has chosen a human rights champion, Salahuddin Wahid, as his running mate. Wahid is deputy of Indonesia's human rights commission and the brother of former president Abdurrahman Wahid.   Hamzah Haz  - United Development Party (PPP) Hamzah Haz is Chairman of Indonesia's third largest party, the Muslim-based United Development Party (PPP).  The seasoned politician has been President Megawati Sukarnoputri's deputy since she became leader in 2001, but announced his bid for president in the 2004 poll after Megawati chose another Muslim leader as her running mate. Haz, 64, has at times been a controversial deputy president. He once described the United States as 'the king of terrorists' and expressed support for radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir before Bashir was arrested as a terrorism suspect. He has chosen the transport minister and former army general, Agum Gumelar, as his running mate.   Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  - Democrat Party According to recent pre-election polls, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former Indonesian military chief and chief security minister, is the favourite to win the presidential election.  Yudhoyono, 54, was security minister in President Megawati Sukarnoputri's coalition cabinet until he resigned in March 2004 amid a row with her over his presidential ambitions.  The popular former military chief, commonly known by his initials SBY, is one of the founders of the Democrat Party, established in 2002. The small party gained less than 10 per cent of votes in the April parliamentary poll, placing it fifth, but polls show it is personal popularity that will count most in the presidential race. Yudhoyono has pledged to fight separatism and terrorism and to win back investment if he is elected president.  Yudhoyono has chosen a former Golkar social welfare minister, Jusuf Kalla, as his running mate in the presidential race.   Amien Rais  - National Mandate Party (PAN) Amien Rais was one of the few outspoken critics of harsh government rule under former president Suharto, and was a leader in the nationwide demonstrations that precipitated the standing down of Suharto in 1998. Rais, 60, once led the second largest moderate Muslim group in the country, Muhammadiyah, which has thrown its support behind his presidential bid. In the past five years, the former university lecturer in politics has proved his prowess at the podium as Indonesia's Consultative Assembly Speaker. He has been described as a political opportunist and wildly ambitious, and is known for swinging his ideology from religious right to centre and back. Rais, whose National Mandate Party won less than 7 per cent in the parliamentary elections, has pledged to work safeguard democracy, restore the economy and fight corruption if he is elected president. He has chosen Siswono Yudhohusodo, a nationalist businessman and former minister under Suharto, as his vice presidential candidate.

In its annual report on the region's human rights, Amnesty says authorities are jailing, torturing and possibly even killing people under the guise of cracking down on terrorism.  It also says draconian laws that impinge on human rights are being drafted as part of counterterrorism legislation.  In particular Amnesty has accused China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Thailand of harbouring the belief that human rights can be curtailed under the 'war on terror' umbrella.   It says Hong Kong could have been added to the list had authorities not reacted to a protest by half a million people against security legislation many believed would have eroded civil liberties.    North Korea   The Amnesty report says while the threat of war between the regions newly nuclearised adversaries, India and Pakistan, has eased, thanks to diplomatic efforts, North Korea's resumption of reprocessing activities is a cause for grave concern. North Korea has also been singled out for a litany of offences, including doing little to relieve its population of the famine and starvation that has blighted it for much of the past decade.   Indonesia   Amnesty International says Indonesia resorted to increasingly repressive methods last year in its attempts to crush separatist movements in Aceh and Papua provinces.  The rights group has reported a rise in extrajudicial executions, 'disappearances', arbitrary detention, torture, forced displacement and destruction of property since martial law was declared and a military operation launched in Aceh in May 2003.   It says military operations against both armed and peaceful independence activists in Papua also resulted in human rights violations, including arbitrary detention and torture.   China   The Amnesty report says China's rights record has made little progress in the past year and has worsened in areas such as the treatment of ethnic minorities.   Thailand   Thailand's war on drugs has marred its rights record in 2003.  According to Amnesty International, 2,245 people were killed in the three-month anti-narcotics campaign launched in February, which was aimed at curbing rampant methamphetamine addiction.    Burma   Despite its claims to be pursuing democratic reforms, Amnesty says Burma's ruling junta carried out serious rights abuses in 2003 including a violent attack on Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition. It says some 1,350 political prisoners are languishing in the nation's jails, many of them prisoners of conscience. Among them is democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi herself, who was taken into custody along with other leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) after a May 30 attack on her convoy during a political tour of northern Burma.   Vietnam and Laos   Vietnam and Laos have both been accused of serious violations against freedom of expression. The Amnesty report condemns the Hanoi and Vientiane governments for their arrests and often-lengthy imprisonment of political and religious dissidents.

Officers from the country's central bank recently seized documents from a Port Moresby hotel, targeting yet another pyramid scheme promising fantastic returns for a tiny investment.   Our PNG correspondent, Shane McLeod, reports on the latest in a string of fast money scams, which have taken thousands of people for a ride.  For years fast money schemes have plagued PNG, making promises that are simply too good to be true. Promoters spruik fantastic returns for small investments - hundreds and thousands of per cent for just a few months' use of your money.  Sadly, they rarely deliver, something thousands of Papua New Guineans discover every year. One woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, lost money in a scheme known as Hosava. 'One of them came and talked to me about it and he asked me if I can give him some money, just to invest it somewhere,' the woman says. 'I went there and I gave him $500 and then I did fill out the forms and he told me that after three months I would get the $36,000,' she says. Of course she has never seen the money.    Fooling the public   The country's central bank, the Bank of Papua New Guinea, has wrestled with the schemes for years.  The bank recently targeted another scheme, called Papalain, which is believed to have been operating from a local hotel for months. The bank's deputy governor, Benny Popoitai, describes the people who run these schemes as convincing liars. 'They are normally fast talking people who are able to convince the public to... place money with them, simply because they wanted a fast return,' he says. 'These people, the promoters of money schemes, are liars and they fool the public into placing money with them.'   Scheme promoter on the run   Papalain is just the latest.  The most notorious of recent years was U-Vistract, which promised fabulous wealth to the many thousands who invested in it.  Some of the contributors, usually high profile Papua New Guineans, received their payouts. But most didn't, and were still waiting for their money when the central bank stepped in and closed down the scheme. U-Vistract's promoter, Noah Musingku, is still on the run, facing arrest warrants in PNG and Solomon Islands.  He's now said to be in Bougainville, in the company of reclusive secessionist Francis Ona, and reportedly making more claims about big payouts.  The governor of Bougainville, John Morris, told our reporter, Caroline Tiriman, that Mr Musingku is misleading a lot of people on the island. 'I guess it is convenient for him to hide in the mountains of Panguna and continue to mislead those who are gullible,' Mr Morris says. 'It's taking the focus away from the real issues that the people of Bougainville should be involved in, for example finalising the constitution, working on reconstruction and rehabilitation of life on the ground,' he says.   Anger against bank staff   Mr Popoitai from the Bank of PNG says his officers will continue to pursue the schemes, but concedes not everyone's happy when the schemes are closed down. 'We don't get any more popular. The bank, the staff, and every one of us who do that, we don't get popular at all,' Mr Popoitai says. 'It's not a comfortable thing to do, to go out and tell the public that you just lost your money. So yes, we do not get any popularity out of this exercise. It's not something that we want to do, but we have to do it,' he says. But in an environment where economic challenge is a daily reality, most expect the promise of a quick and fantastic return will continue to attract many.

Australia wants East Timor to honour an agreement signed last year covering the disputed Greater Sunrise field, which would give Australia claim to more than 80 per cent of the gas field. However, East Timor has so far refused. It claims the border should be drawn in the middle of the sea separating the countries, which would place 90 per cent of the oil and gas reserves on East Timor's side.  The argument has heated up in recent weeks, with Dili accusing Australia of stealing its resources and threatening its very future, and Australia vowing to stand by its rights.   The reportage  Four Corners investigates the increasingly rancorous fight between Australia and East Timor over the multi-billion dollar oil and gas bonanza that lies beneath the waters dividing them.  JONATHAN HOLMES, REPORTER: Three weeks ago, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, Dr Mari Alkatiri, swept into the lobby of Dili's best hotel. He'd come to open negotiations to establish a permanent maritime border between his nation, the smallest and poorest in the region, and his richest and most powerful neighbour.   East Timor wants the matter settled within three years. Australia has said it might take 20. It's a David and Goliath contest, and Mari Alkatiri had brought a sling full of verbal stones to hurl at his opponents.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): For us, a 20-year negotiation is not an option. Timor-Leste loses $1 million a day due to Australia's unlawful exploitation of resources in the disputed area. Timor-Leste cannot be deprived of its rights or territory because of a crime.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To open negotiations by publicly accusing your opponents of profiteering from a crime is, by diplomatic standards, like chucking a grenade. The Australian team returned fire with the curtest handshakes in their armoury. Back in Australia, their boss would be even less amused.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: I think they've made a very big mistake thinking that the best way to handle this negotiation is trying to shame Australia, is mounting abuse on our country, um...accusing us of being bullying and rich and so on, when you consider all we've done for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri is unapologetic. He claims his country is being cheated, and he's going to go on saying so - to his own people, to Australia, and to the world.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I'm here to defend the interests of my people. Of course, there are many ways to do it, but I think that, uh, for a small country, a poor country to be listened to, uh...we need to voice loudly our voice, and that's what I'm trying to do.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Meanwhile, the Australian Embassy has been besieged by angry demonstrators.   PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We know we have profitable resources, but we know that you are exploiting our oil and stealing it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, these people hailed Australia as their protector. Now they say that they'll be forced to play the beggar unless Australia stops behaving like a thief.   Just over an hour's flight to the south, the gleaming little city of Darwin dreams of future greatness. Across the harbour, in what was pristine wilderness just a few months ago, they're building a plant to liquefy natural gas for export to Japan.   CLARE MARTIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY CHIEF MINISTER: Four out of nine levels of the LNG tank has been constructed, and, uh, it really...in many ways it could double up a sports stadium. I don't know how it compares with Colonial, but it's big.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The gas will arrive through a seabed pipeline from a giant gas field deep beneath the Timor Sea, 500km north-west of Darwin. The Bayu-Undan field lies substantially closer to East Timor than it does to Australia. But just south of Timor lies the Timor Trough, 3km deep in places. Far easier, the oilmen claim, to run the pipeline across shallow seas to Darwin and its First World infrastructure. And far better for Australia too.  BRUCE FADELLI, PRESIDENT, NT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE: So far there's been a large influx in construction into the Northern Territory. That's about to gear up even further in June with the start of the laying of the pipeline, so it's been a welcome boost to the construction industry.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the potential bonanza for Darwin lies in a vast, still undeveloped gas field called Greater Sunrise - three times the size of Bayu-Undan, and located still closer to East Timor. Territorians are fervently hoping that that gas will be piped to Darwin too.   BRUCE FADELLI: It's got the potential to create 80,000 jobs Australia wide - 20,000 in the Northern Territory - and the tax revenue benefit from all that investment is in the order of $22 billion over the 20-year life of the project.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timor Sea could transform Darwin into an industrial centre, and the Territory into a State. The town of Suai, just across the Timor Sea from Darwin, has no such grand ambitions. This is a different world.   On the whole length of East Timor's south coast, there is not one natural harbour. The fishermen of Suai have to use canoes that are light enough to come in with the surf. These are treacherous waters. The fishermen never travel far from the beach. Their catch is correspondingly modest. Their incomes are tiny, their horizons limited.   You have no thoughts about the oil and the gas out there in the sea there, about who it belongs to?   FISHERMAN (TRANSLATION): I'm sorry, we don't know these things. We don't know who it belongs to. But you can talk to us about fishing.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The women of Suai Loro take a still more modest share of the riches of the Timor Sea. Every morning they walk a kilometre from the village to collect water from the sea. And then, laboriously, they carry it back. Even the fresh water is brackish here. It's hard to eke a living from the salt-laden soil. So the women make their living from salt instead. If you earn a dollar a day in East Timor, you're comparatively rich. These women make much less.   It's taken hours to gather enough firewood for the job. It will take hours more for the water to boil away, leaving a detritus of sea salt. Early next morning in Suai market up on the hill the salt can be sold, or more likely bartered for a handful of rice or a parcel of greens.   KERYN CLARK, OXFAM COMMUNITY AID ABROAD: East Timor is one of the poorest countries in the world. It ranks as the poorest in Asia. Very high levels of maternal mortality, a high level of infant mortality, really poor nutritional practices, very poor food security. So, I think in terms of where I've worked, with often being in-conflict countries, I think really it does compare, unfortunately, with those countries such as Angola, Mozambique.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor, of course, is not in conflict now. But for 24 years it was - until the final paroxysm in September 1999.  This is how the marketplace of Suai looked after the militia and the Indonesian military had finished with it. By the time the INTERFET peacekeepers from Australia and New Zealand arrived in Suai, the culprits had fled into West Timor. The young men who'd been hiding in the hills filtered back into the town to greet their new protectors. Then they went to the ruins of the church, where their wives, their children and their old people had sought the protection of the priests.   Eyewitnesses say the militia used machetes to hack down the priests. The military tossed hand grenades into the church and used machine guns on those who ran out. The fleeing militia trucked corpses and survivors alike over the border to West Timor. Not all have returned. So no-one really knows how many were killed in Suai, but certainly hundreds.   The church has been repaired, the trauma has not and nor has much of the devastation.   KERYN CLARK: Many buildings haven't been rebuilt. There was also massive destruction of people's own assets, so their, um...for example, if they had ploughs or tools that they were working the land with, they've...they've gone. They lost a lot of their animals. They just really lost everything.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But at least East Timor did gain the independence it had fought for so stubbornly for 24 years. With the flags and fireworks two years ago came heartfelt thanks to its neighbour across the Timor Sea.   JOSE RAMOS-HORTA (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): John Howard, you are a friend of East Timor. Your support to our small nation is invaluable and we are delighted to welcome you among us tonight.   JOHN HOWARD (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): This is a very proud day for Australia but, more importantly, I know it is a very proud day for all of the people of East Timor. You deserve every moment of that warmth and pride.   ANGRY PROTESTER (TRANSLATION): We'll scream with all our strength, together as East Timorese. We will never be slaves again. Never again, never again! Long live the people of East Timor!  JONATHAN HOLMES: But now, in many Timorese eyes, Australia has been transformed from saviour to ogre. The argument is ultimately about oil and gas and money. But it's rooted in history and geography and the law of the sea. The Timorese believe it's crucial to their fledgling nation.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): It is a question of life or death, a question of being continually poor, continually begging, or to be self-sufficient.   JONATHAN HOLMES: To find the origins of the dispute, we must go back more than 30 years to when the Portuguese still ruled in Dili. Coup leader, General Suharto, was still consolidating his power in Jakarta. And Australia had become aware that beneath the seabed to its north might lie enormous wealth in oil and gas. In the late '60s, Australia and Indonesia began negotiating a permanent seabed boundary.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: The legal background at that time was that the World Court in the North Sea continental shelf cases had just determined that the continental shelf is the natural prolongation of the land territory and that a state has sovereign rights in relation to the continental shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: If sea levels were 200 metres lower than they are, the continent of Australia would stretch far to the north. Only the narrow width of the Timor Trough would separate Australia from Timor Island. Australia argued that the Trough marked the edge of its continental shelf and the Indonesians essentially agreed.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But that was the law then, you know. That was the existing Indonesian legislation and that was also, uh, the normal international legislation at that moment, so considering that one, I think it's somewhat fair at that time.   JONATHAN HOLMES: In 1972, the two neighbours agreed on a seabed border that followed the southern edge of the Timor Trough, much closer to Timor than to Australia. Opposite Portuguese East Timor, they left what came to be known as the Timor Gap. The Portuguese declined to negotiate with Australia to close the Gap. The law of the sea, they believed, would soon change in their favour.   But by 1974, after a coup in Lisbon, the Portuguese hold on East Timor was faltering. President Suharto's generals were advising him to annexe East Timor, by force, if necessary. Australia was trying to decide its own policy.   In August 1975, Richard Woolcott, Australia's ambassador in Jakarta, sent a secret cable to the Whitlam Government, which contained a now notorious paragraph. Australia, he remarked, had an interest in acquiring as much seabed as possible.   AMBASSADOR RICHARD WOOLCOTT, CABLEGRAM TO CANBERRA, JAKARTA, 17 AUGUST 1975: This could be much more readily negotiated with Indonesia by closing the present gap than with Portugal or independent East Timor. I know I am recommending a pragmatic rather than a principled stand, but that is what national interest and foreign policy is all about.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: And that was Australian policy from that day until 24 years later - at tremendous cost of human life in East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: You can ask Whitlam and Fraser, but I think that is a complete myth. Um, that is, uh, selectively quoting one document. If that were true, then that would be a theme that ran through many documents and many public statements at the time. I don't think that that was something, which would have been significantly in their contemplation. I'd be certain of that.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): The Government of Australia should be ashamed of what they've done.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But if you want proof that oil was the key to Australia's policy, say East Timor's supporters, look no further than the Timor Gap Treaty of 1989.   CHARLES SCHEINER (ADDRESSING PROTEST RALLY): And that treaty was illegal and the whole world knew it was illegal, but Australia and Indonesia wanted to take advantage of the dying and the killing and the suffering and the struggling that was going on East Timor.   ONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty was famously signed by Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas in a plane circling above the Timor Sea. It hadn't proved easy, in the end, to close the Timor Gap. The Indonesians had changed their tune, now arguing that the Timor Trough was a geological irrelevance. For years, neither side would give way.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: But in the end we come to the realisation, despite our disagreement in settling this geological quarrel and dispute, we need to do something, and one way of doing it which is justified under international law is to develop a joint development.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty closed the Timor Gap not by drawing a line, but by carving out a joint development zone. Royalties from oil and gas found within it would be split 50/50. The northern border of the zone followed the edge of the Timor Trough. Its southern border marked the halfway point between Australia and East Timor, the so-called 'Median Line'.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: The Australian Government at that time did strike a compromise with the Indonesians, uh, and the Indonesians with Australia, in creating a joint development area and that was a pretty sensible sort of a compromise.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But to Fretilin's fighters in the mountains and its leaders in exile, the treaty was simply a sell-out. The UN had never recognised Indonesia as the lawful ruler of East Timor, but now Australia clearly did.   DR MARI ALKATARI, PRIME MINISTER OF TIMOR-LESTE: We immediately understood why, uh, at that time, Australia decided to recognise the illegal occupation and they...their reasons are the resources in the Timor Sea.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The treaty gave the green light to serious exploration in the Timor Sea. Quite quickly, the oil companies struck viable deposits. The Corallina and Laminaria fields began production in 1999. Fortunately for Australia, both fields lay just south of its border with Indonesia and just west of the new joint development zone. So the royalties flowed entirely to Australia.   That same year, the East Timorese finally got to decide their own future. Chaos and brutality followed. Australia's leadership of the UN intervention force cost the Australian taxpayer a pretty penny. But the Treasury was already recouping at least some of those costs from the royalties from the Laminaria field, which lay much closer to East Timor than to Australia. Even as its soldiers were winning the gratitude of East Timor by securing its land borders, Australia was pushing hard for the continuation of the Timor Gap Treaty in the Timor Sea. But it found itself then, as it finds itself now, up against a feisty opponent.   PETER GALBRAITH, FORMER UNTAET NEGOTIATOR: It was the desire of the East Timorese and of the United Nations to negotiate about borders and we made that clear.   PETER GALBRAITH (ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE): East Timor is the legal owner of this territory.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Four years ago, Peter Galbraith, at the time an American diplomat, was UN boss Sergio de Mello's choice as the man to take on Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: He smelt a rat in the Timor Gap Treaty. He thought that the 50/50 split was something that Indonesia had agreed to because it had gotten something in return - namely recognition of the annexation of East Timor - but that under international law, that wouldn't be the right deal for East Timor.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Right from the start, claims Galbraith, he made it clear that East Timor claimed total sovereignty over an area much bigger than the joint development zone.   PETER GALBRAITH: It would be wider to the east and to the west, and it would extend down to the midpoint between the two countries. We showed them maps in October 2000 here in Dili at the start of the first formal round of negotiations on the Timor Sea Treaty. We showed them maps as to what we thought was the correct line and we tried hard to get that line.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australian negotiators adamantly refused to discuss permanent borders or anything outside the zone, until there was a sovereign East Timorese government to talk to.   PETER GALBRAITH: And so we had no choice. We had to negotiate about arrangements for this area, which is only part of Timor-Leste's maritime space, to see what kind of deal we could get relating to petroleum in that area alone.   JONATHAN HOLMES: On the face of it, they got a pretty good deal. In July 2001, Mari Alkatiri, representing East Timor's unelected leadership, and Peter Galbraith, for the UN, signed a provisional agreement with Australia, which would later form the basis of a new Timor Sea Treaty. Instead of 50%, East Timor would get 90% of tax revenues from oil and gas in the joint development area. The Australians now claim it was a generous concession, which recognised the gross disparity of wealth between the two sides without entirely surrendering Australia's legal position.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: We obviously had a robust negotiation, but in the end we decided that we'd give them 90% of the government revenue on the basis of generosity. I think when a country is generous to another country, to turn around then and accuse them of bad faith is probably not a brilliant negotiating tactic.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The East Timorese, even then, saw it differently.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We can't understand Mr Downer, Mr John Howard saying they are being generous to us, we can't. According to international experts and international law, if the maritime border is the median line between the two coastlines, we are the one being generous with Australia. We are giving 10% of what belongs to us to Australia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Peter Galbraith, now a private consultant, has been brought back to Dili by Mari Alkatiri, to lead the East Timorese team in its border negotiations. But he's been making the same argument all along, based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which, since 1982, his team maintains, has changed the law entirely.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): Nuno will outline the legal case.   DR NUNO ANTUNES, MARITIME LAW ADVISER, TIMOR-LESTE: Equidistance or very slight variations of equidistance - over 60 cases.   If two states lie less than 400 nautical miles apart, they claim, as Australia and East Timor do, the border should be drawn halfway between them, regardless of the shape of the seabed.   PETER GALBRAITH (ADDRESSING MEETING): How many cases support their argument?   DR NUNO ANTUNES: I only know of one, which is the Australian case.   PETER GALBRAITH: In fact the court, in a number of cases, including one between Libya and Malta, explicitly said that where states are less than 400 nautical miles apart, the underlying features are of no relevance whatsoever.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When Australia assigned 90% of the royalties to East Timor back in 2001, says Peter Galbraith, it was because it knew its legal case was fatally weak.   PETER GALBRAITH: They know full well that under international law a court would put the boundary at the median point between the two countries and that would mean that 100% of the resource in the area that was the subject of the Timor Sea Treaty would come to East Timor.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, he would. I mean, he is the negotiator for East Timor. And, I mean, you couldn't call Mr Galbraith an objective analyst or observer in this case.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: I think Australia has a credible case to put.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Professor Gillian Triggs, who's been a commercial consultant to Timor Sea oil companies and advised regional governments on maritime law, believes Australia's claims still have validity.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: But I think it also has to be understood that the 1982 convention still privileges those states that have a continental shelf. In other words, if you actually have a shelf, then you're entitled to the full extent of that shelf.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Timor Sea Agreement had its advantages for everyone. Crucially, it gave ConocoPhillips and their partners the security to pour billions into the big new gas field at Bayu-Undan, which lies entirely within the joint development area. The LNG plant and the pipeline to Darwin went ahead, bringing jobs and investment in their wake. By 2007, East Timor should be receiving tens of millions of dollars a year in royalties from Bayu-Undan.   But even back in 2001, there were plenty who believed that the secretive negotiations had sold East Timor short. Outsiders were beginning to realise what the negotiators had known all along - that East Timor might well be entitled to total sovereignty, not just over the joint development area, but over tracts of the Timor Sea at either side. The argument is that the lines which define the eastern and western edges of the joint development area are not where they should be. They closely follow lines of equidistance between East Timor and Indonesia. In other words, every point on those lines is an equal distance from the nearest point of land on either side.   But according to Dr Nuno Antunes, a respected maritime law expert who's on East Timor's negotiating team, equidistant lines in this case don't produce a fair result - and international law demands fairness.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: For example, this line here, which is the line to the west of the JPDA, is completely influenced by one single point here, which is on the Indonesian coast, and why? Because if you...if you notice, this point is very close to the boundary and is very prominent, and it has an undue impact that international lawyers identified as, uh, a special circumstance, and that special circumstance should be object of relief - i.e., in a way that would turn the boundary to this side.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Similar though different arguments apply to the eastern border of the joint development area, says Dr Antunes.   DR NUNO ANTUNES: And that would be my opinion why these lines have to be opened to accommodate to a further extent the rights of Timor-Leste.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS, INTERNATIONAL LAW, MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY: On the, um, authorities that I've read, that part of the coastline to the western side of East Timor is a relatively smooth coastline and is one from which an equidistant line can properly be drawn, but there is always another view, and indeed, if so, then that should be discussed and negotiated.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even a small adjustment to the lateral lines could make a dramatic difference to East Timor. If a maritime boundary were agreed only slightly to the west, East Timor would gain all the royalties from the Laminaria oilfields - perhaps another $300 million a year for the next few years. Far more lucrative is the massive Greater Sunrise field to the east. Based on the current line, 20% of the field lies inside the development area, and 80% under the Australian seabed. The Timor Sea Treaty agrees to divide the royalties accordingly. But shift the line just a few kilometres eastward, and those proportions might be reversed - putting billions of extra dollars East Timor's way over the next 30 years.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: We don't take the view that these resources belong to us in this generation. These resources belong to future generations of Timorese. We are committed to sustainable development of this country. We are committed to a permanent petroleum fund that will utilise these resources in a sustainable manner, not just for us, but for our children, our grandchildren, our grandchildren's children. That's what it's all about.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor's total budget today - for education, for health care, for infrastructure, for security - is around $100 million - that's a good bit less than the Australian Sports Commission's. But even that much money is hard to find. From people as poor as this, there's precious little tax to be raised. International donors' funds are already drying up. The revenue from Bayu-Undan will enable East Timor to subsist for the next 20 years. But $8 or $10 billion extra, wisely used, could theoretically provide financial security and real development for the long term.   XANANA GUSMAO, PRESIDENT OF TIMOR-LESTE (TRANSLATION): We know we can develop this land, give our people a better life, and we feel that this opportunity is being taken away from us. And on top of that, it's something that belongs to us.   ALEXANDER DOWNER, FOREIGN MINISTER: If there is an issue of economic disparity between Australia and East Timor, that should be addressed through aid programs, which it is, um...and other mechanisms. That should not be addressed through shifting boundaries and changing international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: That professed regard for international law rings somewhat hollow in some ears, because in March 2002, just weeks before East Timor gained its independence, Australia announced it would no longer accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice on matters relating to its maritime borders.   CHARLES SCHEINER, INSTITUTE FOR RECONSTRUCTION MONITORING ANALYSIS: Australia claims to be a democratic country. It claims to be a law-abiding member of the world community. Uh, they've...Australia has withdrawn from the courts. Can I commit a crime, then withdraw from the court and say, 'No, the court had no jurisdiction'? My neighbours wouldn't be very happy about that.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We have said that we would rather negotiate all of our arrangements with other countries, not just with East Timor, but with Indonesia. And remember, we have to think about our other relationships when we think about this relationship. We will determine all of those on a bilateral basis. Not having courts and arbiters and, you know, people over there in the Hague deciding on our relationship.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: Australia's decision to withdraw from the International Court of Justice reduced East Timor's opportunities to get a fair maritime boundary in accordance with international law. There's no question about it.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The eve of Independence, in May 2002. Behind the scenes, the new nation's leaders are under huge pressure. The oil companies and the international donors, as well as Australia, were insistent that their first action must be to sign and then ratify the Timor Sea Treaty.   A chorus of voices at home and abroad had been urging the new Prime Minister not to trust Australia, not to sign, to hold out. But he ignored them. A rival oil company has even filed suit in the USA recently, alleging that ConocoPhillips, the operator of Bayu-Undan, paid millions of dollars to Mari Alkatiri for his signature.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I never received any single coin from anybody.   PETER GALBRAITH: Those kinds of allegations are, um...crap.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Alkatiri says his country desperately needed the money from Bayu-Undan and he believed the Treaty would give him the leverage to pressure Australia into negotiating new permanent borders. When Alexander Downer next came to Dili a year later, it looked as though Alkatiri had succeeded.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): It's formally recognised already that there are overlapping claims in the zone. That's why we're going to initiate a new process of negotiation on maritime boundaries. We will do it.   ALEXANDER DOWNER (ADDRESSING PRESS CONFERENCE): We have lively negotiations, Australia and East Timor, because we're lively and interesting and entertaining people. So, um...we'll look forward to that. (Laughs)   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Australia's been in no hurry. Two years after independence, the first substantive negotiating session's just been held. At Australia's insistence, six months will pass before the next one. In East Timor, they plant and harvest a rice crop in less time than that. From the paddy fields of Suai to the government in Dili, a sense of impatience and even betrayal has been growing.   MARIA AMARAL (TRANSLATION): That's why I'm asking the Australian Government to resolve the oil issue quickly - so that our young ones will be able to work and look after their younger siblings and we will be able to send our children overseas to study.   JOSE TEIXEIRA, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INVESTMENT, TIMOR-LESTE: It's become quite clearly evident, particularly in the latter part of last year, that in fact what was always intended to be an interim provisional treaty was in fact going to be used to extract a permanent benefit.   JONATHAN HOLMES: East Timor claims Australia is in flagrant breach of international law by continuing to take the revenue from the oilfields of Laminaria. They're in an area, they say, which even Australia has recognised is in dispute. Yet in a few years, there'll be no oil left.   PETER GALBRAITH: I don't expect the Australians to come to some quick conclusion. I don't expect them to change their position, but I think they should be in the same position as East Timor - that is, nobody gets the resource until we can agree who gets the resource, and that's exactly what has been required under international law.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Even Professor Triggs acknowledges that there's a case for putting the royalties from Laminaria into a trust account until the matter's resolved.   PROFESSOR GILLIAN TRIGGS: It's not for me to tell the Government what to do, but I think that if there is any credibility to the East Timorese argument on shifting that line further to the west, and if that were to be determined on any objective assessment of the law and of the geographical features that you mention, then there's a very good argument for putting the funds in escrow for a period.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But the Government doesn't appear to accept that East Timor's claims have sufficient credibility to justify any such action.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Well, our response is that we're there in the Australian area, in the Australian maritime area, and that we will treat them - those areas - as such. I do make this point. I don't think that the tactic of strident rhetoric and denunciation of Australia - accusations of greed and ill faith and so on - I don't think that tactic in the end, which is a big surprise to us after all we've done for East Timor, I don't think that is going to prove to be very successful.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's true that East Timor has been blatantly playing to the gallery. It claims it has no other choice.   DR MARI ALKATARI (ADDRESSING CONFERENCE): In addition to blocking a judicial resolution of our maritime dispute, Australia is unilaterally taking the resources from the disputed area.   RADIO ANNOUNCER (TRANSLATION): Australia should respect the people and help us for the future. It shouldn't exploit a small, poor country. We are poor because our resources are in the sea. We are not able to exploit them.  JONATHAN HOLMES: But Mari Alkatiri does have one more card, and he's played that too. Investment in the all-important Greater Sunrise field can't go ahead until the East Timorese Parliament ratifies yet another complex treaty governing how it's to be taxed and the revenue divided. Dr Alkatiri's government signed the so-called Unitisation Agreement last year. But in the current sour climate, he claims, even his own party, Fretilin, would vote against ratification.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think their idea here is that they think that they'll get more concessions out of us by delaying ratification of the Unitisation Agreement and, um...  JONATHAN HOLMES: Will they?   ALEXANDER DOWNER: I think, um... I think not, no. We've reached agreement on unitisation. The best strategy for them is to build good will.   JONATHAN HOLMES: But Sunrise can't go ahead, can it, unless that's ratified?  ALEXANDER DOWNER: It won't go ahead, no.   JONATHAN HOLMES: When the border negotiations finally began three weeks ago - months later than East Timor would have liked - the diplomatic niceties were observed. But only just. The talks themselves, from East Timor's point of view, were little short of a disaster.   PETER GALBRAITH, LEAD NEGOTIATOR, TIMOR-LESTE: I don't think these negotiations are going any place at all because the Australian side has refused to talk about the key issue, which is - where are the lateral lines? And why is that the key issue? Because that's where the money is. The location of those lines means the difference between $4 billion for East Timor and $12 billion for East Timor. The Australian position is that that is not on the table. That's not a matter that's subject to negotiation.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will talk about anything, but we have our own claims, remember? I mean, I know they have their claims. I know they have their claims and I know they have their arguments, and I've seen in the media the fairly strident things that they've had to say, including denouncing my country. I've seen all that and I know all that. But, remember, we have our claims. And we want to stick with our international legal principles, principles that have served us in relation to negotiations with Indonesia, with Papua New Guinea, with New Zealand.   JONATHAN HOLMES: It's Indonesia, as always, that really matters to Australia. The next government in Jakarta may be still harder to deal with than the current one. Australia is determined that East Timor's border claims should not provide another source of friction with its biggest neighbour or, worse still, call into question its longest maritime border.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: Some of the claims they're making in relation to the lateral boundaries will make those lateral boundaries closer to Indonesia than to East Timor. Well, that, of course, isn't a proposition...that isn't a legal proposition that is going to stack up. And that's going to get them into a lot of difficulties with Indonesia.   JONATHAN HOLMES: Indonesia will argue that its seabed boundaries with East Timor should follow the lines of equidistance. Any concession by Australia on lateral boundaries would involve concessions by the Indonesians too. They're unlikely to be cooperative.   DR HASJIM DJALAL, FORMER INDONESIAN AMBASSADOR FOR MARITIME AFFAIRS: I cannot see the reason on what basis that line north-south on this side should be changed. I don't find any justification, and I think East Timor would have difficulty in arguing it.   PETER GALBRAITH: That is a matter to be negotiated both with Indonesia and with Australia, and, of course, East Timor wants to negotiate with both countries. But there's real urgency to the negotiations with Australia and there is no urgency with negotiations with Indonesia. Why is there urgency to the negotiations with Australia? Because, as we speak, Australia is pumping petroleum out of the area that is under dispute, the Government is getting $1 million a day, and so that already, since 1999, $1.5 billion is gone. Every day that we delay is $1 million less for this country.   DR MARI ALKATARI: I think that it is time for the Australian Government to listen to its own people. The people is voicing loudly on this issue and it's better to listen to their own people.   JONATHAN HOLMES: The Timorese seem to believe that the Australian public will be as sympathetic to their cause this time around as it was four years ago. But their loyal supporters in Australia are finding the going tough.   MAN (ADDRESSING RALLY): Today is the formation of the Timor Sea Justice Coalition in Darwin, and this is our first action. Ironically, the enemy has changed from being Indonesia to Australia...   JONATHAN HOLMES: Massacres are one thing, maritime borders quite another. So far, the issue has hardly set Australia alight. The Howard Government seems confident that most Australians will applaud it for hanging tough.   ALEXANDER DOWNER: We will do what we believe to be right, but, of course, in our interests, we are on Australia's side. I'm the Australian Foreign Minister. The obligation on me is to negotiate for the 20 million people in Australia.   PETER GALBRAITH: All we ask is that Australia stop taking the resource until we have an agreement, or that Australia negotiate seriously and rapidly about all the issues, including the lateral boundaries, or that Australia agree to an impartial decision by an international court of Australia's choosing. Any one of those three.   JONATHAN HOLMES: A rapid resolution seems unlikely. There have been harsh words and bitter feelings on both sides. There's no mood at present for pragmatic compromise. It's undeniable that the relationship has soured. Most Australians still feel proud of what their nation did to help its tiny neighbour. But for an Australian in East Timor these days, gratitude is hard to find.

The move could see the country driving down the worldwide price for the medicine. But international experts caution that quality must be assured. In response to a mushrooming HIV/Aids epidemic that has seen many poor farmers affected, the Chinese government in December 2002 gave approval to several domestic pharmaceutical firms to make generic versions of Western drugs whose patents had run out, to try to lower the cost of treatment.  So far, four Chinese companies are producing the anti-Aids medicine.  Shanghai-based Desano Biopharma Corp is exporting seven kinds of raw materials to India, Thailand and Brazil, the Xinhua news agency said.  According to Desano, its partner in South Africa reduced the annual medicine fee for an Aids patient from more than US$10,000 (S$17,000) to US$3,000 after using its materials.  However, international experts said China's Aids drugs have not passed standards set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).  'Lots of efforts are needed for the improvement of quality,' said Mr Zhao Pengfei, the WHO's HIV/Aids coordinator in China.  Currently, some 7,000 Aids patients in China are taking the Chinese anti-retroviral cocktail treatment under a pilot programme, but health officials have said about 20 per cent of them stopped due to severe side effects. Health experts said they supported having more Aids drug producers if the quality could be controlled.

The surplus with Asia, the largest export market for Japan, expanded in a year to Y667.2 billion ($8.5 billion), to post a 10th consecutive monthly gain.  Asia-bound exports rose 19.6 per cent to Y2.49 trillion, with shipments of cameras and other optical equipment jumping 42.2 per cent, and electronic parts up 13.4 per cent.  Exports of steel products to Asia rose 25.7 per cent due to a shipbuilding boom in South Korea, a ministry official said.  Japan's exports to China rose 18.8 per cent while imports from China grew 12.9 per cent.  'The pace of growth in exports to China somewhat slowed as exports to China have until recently been rising 30-40 per cent year on year,' the official noted.  He said it was uncertain whether the slowdown might have been caused by anti-inflation measures by the Chinese banking regulators, such as reducing money in circulation.  Shuji Shirota, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Tokyo, said: 'Japan's deficit with China has been shrinking due to increased exports but the latest data showed export volume was falling slightly.'  Imports from Asia climbed 9.1 per cent to Y1.83 trillion as purchases of electronics parts, such as semiconductors, increased 29.2 per cent.  Imports of office equipment, such as computers, rose 20.8 per cent and audio-video devices were up 27.0 per cent.  'The basic picture of pretty strong growth of exports is unchanged and I think that's still the main positive news for the economy going forward,' said Peter Morgan, chief economist at HSBC Securities.  Japan's overall trade surplus in April rose 30.3 per cent to Y1.08 trillion. The surplus with the US fell 2.4 per cent to Y553.5 billion.  The surplus with the European Union expanded 1.6 per cent to Y275.2 billion.  'The figures confirm Japan's economy is still dependent on external demand. And it's becoming clear that its reliance is shifting towards China and other Asian economies from the United States,' said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities.  Although gross domestic product data last week showed that exports were no longer the biggest contributor to Japan's economic recovery, economists said they remained a key factor underpinning the domestic turnaround.  The GDP data showed that the economy grew a real 1.4 per cent in the first three months of this year, with external demand accounting for just 0.2-percentage point of the expansion.

Officers from the two sides sat together at 10 a.m. at the resort of Mount Kumgang, on the northern side of the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that bisects the Korean peninsula and separates some 1.8 million troops, South Korean defence ministry officials said.   Five-member delegations headed by South Korean Commodore Park Jung-hwa and North Korean Brigadier General An Ik-san were expected to hold about two hours of talks focusing on avoiding naval clashes in the Yellow Sea west of the Korean peninsula.  In recent years, the rich fishing grounds have been the scene of naval clashes during the crab-fishing season in May and June that have killed or wounded scores of sailors on both sides.   The two Koreas technically remain at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. The defence ministers of the rival Koreas met once in 2000 and more junior officers have worked together successfully in the building of rail and road links through the DMZ.

"        HIGHLIGHTS   CHINA – LEGAL AFFAIRS   China's middle class rebels   Doves coo in their cages overlooking the stone courtyard, and the shouts of a man collecting goods for recycling reverberate along the narrow alleyways.   On the surface, this maze of enclosed courtyards, one-storey houses and narrow stone passageways seems to be a picture of traditional Chinese life.  But against this peaceful backdrop a drama is being played out, pitting tradition against modernity, and individuals against the power of the state.   Beijing's old city is being swallowed by the urban sprawl of shopping malls and six-lane highways. Whole blocks are being razed as China moves to create a city of the future to host the 2008 Olympics.   In one area undergoing redevelopment, I met 47-year-old Liu Changshan by chance. He invited me to visit his house, which is facing demolition. It stands alone in a wasteland of broken bricks, the only remaining structure in the entire block.   He described his emotional ties to his property.  'My mother and father got married here,' he said. 'They bought this place before 1949. We're six children and we all grew up here.  'Now my mother and father have both passed away. I can't bear the thought that this house will be destroyed.'  But Mr Liu is refusing to go for financial reasons. He said the compensation offered was not enough to buy a new place, even in the suburbs.  He will get $1,000 per square metre, less than half the market value of the site. And the personal cost is enormous - he has already sacrificed his 20-year-long marriage.   'My wife is someone who works hard, she couldn't live in these conditions. We really felt strongly for each other but every day we argued about our situation. I knew we couldn't go on, so we had to separate, then we divorced.'   Mr Liu is among those paying the price for the city's facelift. One Swiss non-governmental organisation estimates 300,000 people have been evicted in Beijing to make way for Olympic projects.   But officials have argued that figure is too high, and they insist those relocated benefit by having an average of 40 sq m more space per family.  Officials turned down my requests for an interview.    'Benefits'   Lawyer Lester Ross often represents developers. He believes that many residents are happy to take the compensation and move.  'In many instances, people are going to benefit because a great deal of the housing in Beijing, as well as other cities and rural areas, is very substandard,' he said.   In the past, he has had to tackle problems caused by forced evictions by subcontractors working for the city government. But he believes the attitude is changing.  'One of the reasons why construction proceeded so fast is because they have been able to disregard what are considered to be basic rights of people who are residents or who maintain small businesses.  'If you just bulldoze them out of the way, then of course new construction can go on much faster. Beijing, in particular, is concerned now with the greater attention that's coming with the Olympics. Beijing doesn't want the great construction that's under way to be tarnished by public protests,' he said.    'Damage done'   Recently the government announced it will demolish fewer buildings in a bid to tackle growing discontent.  But if Ye Guozhu is anything to go by, the damage may already have been done. His family's house was knocked down with their possessions still inside.  Unhappy with the compensation offered, his brother appealed to the authorities but got nowhere. Desperate, he tried to commit suicide in Tiananmen Square and was given a two-year jail term.    Mr Ye is deeply embittered by the experience.   'This unchecked demolition over the past few years has changed the way that people think about the party and the government. Now people think our government isn't governing for us. They're bandits and hooligans. It's a very deep problem. People have already lost confidence in the government,' he said.   He now liaises with others who have lost their homes. His movements are monitored by the authorities and I was detained when I visited him, an indication of just how nervous the government is.   And he is not the only one who has turned against a government he once supported.  'These demolitions aren't being carried out properly. They're not taking account of people's rights. Everybody thinks that,' said Liu Changshan, the man whose house faces demolition.  Then he pulls back some blue plastic sheeting to show me six huge containers of petrol lined along the walls.  'I'm prepared to take this fuel and pour it over my body. If they knock my house down forcibly, I'll set myself on fire,' he said.   It is a sign this urban renewal is spawning a new generation of revolutionaries. It is ironic that in a communist country that has jettisoned so much of its ideological baggage, homeowners are now being thrust into the position of rebels, defying their government to defend their own property.

The government's pension reform package was based on a more optimistic fertility rate of 1.32 for the year, forecasting it to eventually recover to around 1.39. A figure above 2.08 is needed to sustain the population.   Opposition lawmakers had demanded that the latest figure for 2003 be disclosed before the government-sponsored pension bills were passed.  Some have speculated that the ministry intentionally delayed the announcement of the figure because the government's pension reform plan was based on a more optimistic scenario.  The revelation that the government had already estimated the actual figure to be lower than that used in its pension reform package could fuel further public distrust of the system.  Responding to a written request from Takashi Yamamoto, a House of Councilors member of the Democratic Party of Japan, the welfare ministry said the head of the division in charge of demographic statistics reported an interim result of the latest data to the head of the ministry's statistics and information department on May 24.   But the ministry only released the data on the afternoon of June 10, after major newspapers reported the figure in front page stories that day.  The total fertility rate is a calculation of the average number of children that a woman will bear during her lifetime.  A senior official of the ministry's statistics division said Tuesday the interim figure was 'around 1.29.' He claimed the figure was tentative and not ready for official release.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda meanwhile defended the ministry.  'You need to analyze various factors even after figures are obtained,' he told a regular news conference. 'Usually it takes several days before publication.'  The government's fertility rate forecasts have been consistently overoptimistic for more than two decades, forcing it to repeatedly revise down pension premium revenue assumptions.  A higher birthrate prediction is politically favorable for the government, which has been trying to bathe its social security plan in a rosy glow.  Pension reform will be one of the key topics in the July 11 Upper House election. Welfare minister Chikara Sakaguchi declined to say whether the ministry intentionally delayed the release of the figure.

According to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lee Wen-chung, Wolfowitz said that if Taiwan does not treat its national defense seriously, then the Americans won't either.  Wolfowitz said that if Taiwan did not take action as soon as possible to strengthen its defenses, China would be encouraged to invest more on military equipment, Lee told the Taipei Times after he and a multi-party legislative delegation headed by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) spent a day in Washington discussing Taiwan's arms procurement budget with top defense and State Department officials.  The 15-member delegation was briefed by 25 US military and civilian officials during a breakfast meeting on the first day of a three-day visit on Monday morning, and then went off to separate meetings at the Pentagon and the State Department.  Although Wang is from the pan-blue camp, he still showed support for the purchase.  'The balance of military power on the two sides [of the Taiwan Strait] is necessary to the area's peace, stability and prosperity,' Wang said.  The delegation was to attend a congressional meeting yesterday to discuss the prospects for a measure before the US Congress to enhance military relations between the US and Taiwan through greater joint activities and mutual visits by top officials who are currently barred from such visits by long-term US policy.  That measure, proposed by Senator Sam Brownback, is expected to come up for a vote this week. The House recently approved a parallel bill.  On Monday, American officials were 'vague' about the US' commitment to help Taiwan fend off an attack from China, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Sun Kuo-hua told the Taipei Times.  After the US officials insisted that it would be in Taiwan's best interests to buy the weapons stipulated in the special budget package - diesel submarines, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot anti-missile systems - the legislators received somewhat unsatisfactory answers to their questions, Sun said.  When asked if the US would come to Taiwan's defense against China if it were to buy all the weapons, the US side was 'vague,' Sun said, 'because they couldn't say they wouldn't come to our defense, because if they said that, Beijing would say, `Okay, let's attack.''  'I think the United States is keeping that deliberately vague,' he said.  Washington has long been pressuring Taiwan to buy the robust weapons package US President George W. Bush promised in April 2001.  Meanwhile, Pentagon officials were still unable to provide details on the design and cost of the eight diesel submarines included in the package, Sun said.  'We didn't even see a configuration for the submarines ... there's a lot of uncertainties in the cost estimates,' he said. 'The United States Navy doesn't know.'  Sun indicated that Washington was still looking toward various European countries to provide the designs.   But the US officials 'gave no indication where the subs will come from' and could not provide a price estimate, Sun said.  'They could only give a rough estimate. We want them to be more accurate,' he said.  'How can we approve the cost in the budget if we don't know?' he said.  US shipbuilding companies, 'cannot build diesel submarines,' because they have not manufactured any for more than 40 years, Sun said.

China-Tokyo is expressing concern about a potentially lucrative natural gas field being developed by China near the border of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the East China Sea.  Japanese officials say the project may infringe on Japanese sovereignty, while China says it seeks joint development with Japan.  On Monday, Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi met her Chinese counterpart, Li Zhaoxing, here and expressed her concern.  Kawaguchi, who is visiting China for a regional ministerial conference, asked Li for information on the Chunxiao project because officials in Tokyo believe the area being drilled by China may cross over to Japan's EEZ, Japanese government officials said.  ``There is a possibility the area marked off by China for drilling could be on Japan's side of the border dividing the two countries' EEZs,'' Kawaguchi said, according to officials.  She said it was possible the underwater gas field extends beneath the sea floor into what Japan considers its side of the boundary, and that Japanese natural resources could be tapped by China.  The Chinese foreign minister did not address Kawaguchi's requests for details. Instead, Li said the two sides should continue to stay in touch on the issue.  Li suggested that Japan and China ``shelve their differences'' and jointly develop the gas field.  In Tokyo, Shoichi Nakagawa, minister of economy, trade and industry, said Tuesday in a regular news conference that the government has no plans to jointly develop the natural gas field near Japan's claimed EEZ.  Nakagawa said he plans to inspect the site from a Japan Coast Guard aircraft.  Tokyo and Beijing dispute the boundary of the EEZ in the East China Sea. Tokyo contends that it is drawn at equal distances from the shores of the two countries. But China maintains the border is where the continental shelf ends.  The rig used in the Chunxiao project sits on the Chinese side of the line that Tokyo insists is part of its own EEZ.  Li's suggestion for a joint venture may be interpreted as an attempt to offset criticism from Tokyo, analysts said.  Officials noted that Japan could not join the project anyway, as it is almost finished. Western companies have been helping China.  ``China has not given a direct answer to Japan (over its concerns). They just want to buy time,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official.

A second front, however, opened at once over an issue where Congress finds it harder to take the moral high ground. Several ministers in the coalition government are tainted by criminal charges filed against them.  The new Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, is revered both as a successful former finance minister and as an incorruptible public servant. But he has never won a direct election. Many elected politicians have far dirtier hands. Under rules that came into force last year, candidates in Indian elections now have to reveal their criminal past. According to a tally by Outlook, a weekly magazine, no fewer than 100 of the 542 present members of the lower house face criminal charges.  They include ten of the 25 MPs from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party, Congress's biggest coalition partner. The RJD's fief is Bihar, which, with more than 80m people, is India's third most populous state, and the one where crime and politics are most inextricably linked. A notorious gangster, Mohammad Shahabuddin, was re-elected to parliament last month for the RJD. The fact that he is notionally in prison - in practice, in a comfortable hospital - and was described in a police report last year as a “cold-blooded murderer and hard-core criminal” was, apparently, not an insurmountable obstacle.  The RJD's leader, Laloo Prasad Yadav, stood down as Bihar's chief minister in 1997, when he was arrested on corruption charges, but installed his wife as his proxy. He still faces charges related to one of the biggest frauds on the Indian state ever uncovered, involving the “purchase” by the Bihar government of billions of rupees-worth of non-existent fodder. Mr Yadav, who, rather bizarrely, has become the new railway minister, claims the charges against him are all concocted by his political opponents. Similar claims are made on behalf of his party colleague, Mohammad Taslimuddin, the minister of heavy industries, accused of crimes including attempted murder, intimidation and extortion.   Privately, senior Congress figures say how much it pains the prime minister to welcome such people into his government. In public, Mr Singh points out that they have never been convicted of any crime, and Congress accuses the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party of hypocrisy. Its government, whose six-year tenure ended last month, included a number of politicians facing criminal prosecution for involvement in a riot in 1992 when a mosque was demolished at Ayodhya, triggering widespread communal violence. Bihar is only the most egregious example of a national phenomenon. Criminals bribe and intimidate their way into office for the protection it affords and the opportunities it offers for recouping their investments. Jayaprakash Narayan of Lok Satta, an electoral-reform lobby group, quotes an estimate of 20m rupees ($440,000) as the cost of standing for election in Bihar.  There is some hope that if the new government carries out its promise to introduce the state funding of elections, politics may attract a nicer class of person. Mr Narayan also argues for a system of proportional representation to break the link between constituency and candidate. Perhaps more pressing is the need for an overhaul of the criminal-justice system, which at present seems to produce fewer convictions than ministers.

Dr Amien Rais has been a daily fixture, making appearances on talk shows expounding on themes ranging from politics and the economy to football. But incumbent President Megawati Sukarnoputri has so far shunned TV debates, agreeing only to appear on taped interviews. So far, Dr Amien's polished style - mixing humour with serious remarks - shows him to be the best communicator among the five candidates. While some observers argue that he benefits from such exposure, others doubt the appearances will win him more votes. Viewers who prefer the stern mien of a military man might be more inclined towards retired generals Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Wiranto. Mr Bambang, another regular of presidential debates, has faced Dr Amien in at least three debates when other candidates have failed to show up at the last minute. While Mr Wiranto gladly appears on talk shows or dialogues, he is reluctant to show up alongside other candidates in a debate. However, while media exposure might boost their bids, some candidates have chosen to stage no-shows, citing reasons like illness or fatigue. But commitments to take part in televised debates are no guarantees that they will turn up eventually, Mr Riza Permadi, news director of new TV network Trans TV, told The Straits Times. Last week, the more established SCTV also cancelled a debate between Mr Wiranto and Dr Amien when the former pulled out at the last minute, citing fatigue from constant travelling. Mr Hamzah Haz also called in sick an hour before a debate on Trans TV that was to set him and his running mate against the Wiranto- Salahuddin Wahid pair. But Ms Megawati is by far the most media shy. Trans TV has so far failed to get Ms Megawati to appear on its weekly presidential debates because it refused to concede to her demand to replace a team of panelists comprising analysts and human rights activists with journalists. Ms Megawati is the only candidate who has not agreed to participate in Trans TV's fourth - and last - presidential debate next Monday. Analysts attribute the president's coolness to live appearances to her lack of media savvy. Said University of Indonesia political communication expert Deddy Hidayat: 'Ms Megawati's communication skill is among the worst of the five candidates. 'From the interviews we have seen so far, she appeared authoritarian and temperamental, especially when she is being asked critical questions.'  Regardless of candidates' desire for air time, however, analysts doubt whether the debates have any significant effect in winning voters over. For one, the TV debates have been criticised for being too 'clinically clean' - candidates are not allowed to confront each other as they field questions from teams of panellists or members of the audience. Often, the debates also get fairly pedestrian, with candidates saying similar things. And their answers could also exhibit more style than substance. Said media analyst Hinca Panjaitan: 'Both the panellists and the candidates like to use big words and show off their sophistication. This may backfire on them by alienating uneducated viewers.'

Days ago the Civil Union Bill had been expected to comfortably clear its first reading tomorrow and go to a select committee for public scrutiny.  But last night, numbers in favour of the bill had dropped, as some Labour and National MPs indicated they had major reservations.  The bill offers civil unions as an alternative to marriage, for gay and straight couples.  A second new law, the Relationships Bill, would end discrimination against same-sex and de facto couples but is not expected to be voted on until next week.  An indication that numbers are tighter than expected has come with Prime Minister Helen Clark's clear support for civil unions.  And yesterday Labour's first openly gay MP, Chris Carter, argued passionately for the two bills.  If they were voted down, he said, New Zealand risked its reputation as a society tolerant of diversity.  He also reminded fellow Labour MPs that introducing civil unions and ending discrimination against gays was party policy.  At least 60 of Parliament's 119 MPs will have to back the bill for it to be sent to a select committee.  Last week, the bill was thought to have support from 70 to 73 MPs. That may now be down to 63 or 64 votes.  Up to 10 Labour MPs oppose the bill. Their votes will be critical, as will any move by MPs to abstain.  Those in Labour thought to oppose civil unions include critics of the law decriminalising prostitution last year, such as Taito Phillip Field, Dover Samuels, Clayton Cosgrove, Damien O'Connor and possibly Harry Duynhoven and Janet Mackey.  Two who backed prostitution laws, but are against civil unions, are Cabinet ministers Paul Swain and John Tamihere.  Most of those MPs also form a conservative cabal within Labour, and were unhappy at Helen Clark's February Cabinet reshuffle, which saw David Benson-Pope inherit the Civil Union Bill from his sacked predecessor Lianne Dalziel.  Complicating the debate is the civil unions' companion legislation, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill, which would end discrimination against couples who are not married, both straight and gay, and in de facto or civil union relationships.  NZ First yesterday said two of its 13 MPs had indicated their support of the Civil Union Bill to a select committee. Only a handful of National MPs are expected to do the same.  United Future's eight MPs oppose the bill. The nine Green MPs and two Progressive MPs support it.  Act's eight MPs are split, and independent Donna Awatere Huata remains undecided.

Investors may not provide the support it needs to become an independent entity.    The so-called second board at the Shenzhen stock exchange is opening with a roster of eight companies. Their six-digit tickers begin with 002, setting them apart from Shenzhen's 000 series and the 600 used in Shanghai, the bigger of mainland China's two exchanges. The stocks will trade on the same electronic system and be subject to the same regulations as stocks on Shenzhen's main board.   Ophelia Tong won't be a buyer. The investment director of Hong Kong-based HT Capital Management said she did not pay attention to smaller exchanges such as Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market or even Shenzhen's main board. 'What's the point?' she said. 'It's insignificant.'   Without commitment from investors, the new forum may not draw enough money or listings to avoid the fate of similar initiatives. Nasdaq Stock Market pulled out of its Nasdaq Japan venture in 2002 after two years of losses, and turnover on Hong Kong's GEM, which opened in 1999, has slumped.   Some investors say creating the second board may detract from China's efforts to stamp out financial scandals at companies such as Guangxia (Yinchuan) Industry, fined last year for the nation's biggest securities fraud.   'The primary concern for fund managers is corporate governance and the quality of the assets,' said Ho Kok Hua, a fund manager at APS Asset Management in Singapore.   Securities scandals helped make Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks the world's worst performers last year even as China had the fastest economic growth among major nations. Shanghai's composite index rose 10.3 percent while its Shenzhen counterpart fell 2.6 percent.   This year, the Shanghai index has fallen 4.3 percent and Shenzhen is down 2.8 percent. The benchmarks are among the 10 worst performers this quarter out of 60 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg.   Shenzhen's second board adds another pool of stocks to China's array of Class A and B shares, Hong Kong-traded H shares and listings in Singapore and New York.   The first batch of companies, which raised 2.3 billion yuan, or $278 million, in share sales, include Zhejiang NHU, a producer of food additives and health care products, and Zhejiang Jinggong Science Technology, a maker of construction and textile machinery.   Initially, their shares will trade through existing main-board platforms and will be included in the Shenzhen Composite index, according to the exchange's Web site.   The new market will evolve into an independent entity 'when the time is ripe,' the Web site says.   Companies will be subject to the same regulations, including rules on earnings reports, as main-board stocks. Like other Class A shares, they will be denominated in yuan and open only to domestic investors and a few overseas fund managers approved by China's government.   Li Mingzhong, a spokesman for the Shenzhen exchange, said a second-board index would be created when there were more listed companies.   The board is aimed at companies with a technology focus, the exchange said in a statement on its Web site.   None of the share sales by the first eight companies and 10 more that plan to join them in coming weeks has exceeded 30 million shares. Li, the exchange spokesman, said that was not an explicit limit.

The employees were taken from a state-run cement works in Udaipur district on Tuesday and a search by security forces has brought no clues.  There has been no word from the rebels, who are fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist republic.  In the past, rebels have made abductees attend political and cultural programmes before freeing them.  Thousands of people, including students and teachers across the kingdom, have been taken to remote rebel hideouts and later released after a few days.  About 9,000 people have died in the eight-year struggle between the Maoists and Nepal's security forces.

That's quite a feat for someone who is supposed to have retired.    Controversy number one arose after President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said in an interview in May that the Malaysian and Chinese governments had provided partial funding for his US$5 million oriental-design, 25-bedroom mansion near the capital, Harare. He did not make it clear whether the supply of rare timber for paneling in the mansion, under construction for more than five years, represented the full extent of Malaysia's involvement.   Mugabe's comments sparked a public outcry in Malaysia, and it took Mahathir 15 days to shed some light on the issue, which appeared to have caught the Malaysian government and cabinet unaware.   'Yes, I think we did' supply timber for the mansion, Mahathir finally told reporters on June 10, but added that this was the 'usual practice' in promoting Malaysian timber abroad. Mugabe has often said he regards Mahathir as a close friend, and the two men share many similarities, including a strong anti-Western rhetoric that has been undermined by autocratic rule at home.   After Mahathir's admission, Malaysia's opposition parties and public interest groups responded by calling for an immediate probe into the gift of timber.   'Mahathir is also accountable to the public for his action,' said P Ramakrishnan, president of the social reform group, Aliran. 'He must come clean by providing facts and figures to justify why a guy like Mugabe, who is regarded as a tyrant and a despotic dictator, deserves this 'gift' from Malaysians.'    No sen in sight  Barely had the dust settled when Mahathir caught media attention again on June 17. This time, he was widely reported as saying he was 'not getting even one sen' from serving as adviser to national petroleum corporation Petronas and national car maker Proton, as well as to the development authorities of two resort islands - Langkawi, off Mahathir's home state of Kedah, and Tioman, off the peninsula's east coast.   He said he was only receiving the pension for serving as prime minister for more than 22 years. This amounted to half of his last-drawn monthly salary of RM20,000 ($5,260), he was reported as saying in the pro-establishment Star, the country's top-selling English-language newspaper.   'I don't get a single sen at all,' he said. 'I am provided an office by Petronas.' Mahathir said he needed to explain this matter because there had been talk that he was receiving huge allowances from these particular firms and agencies, the Star reported.   A day later, Mahathir was forced to 'clarify'. In a report by Utusan Malaysia, a paper linked to his former party, the ruling United Malays National Organization, Mahathir said he did receive taxable monthly allowances from Petronas after all. 'However, the amount he received was totally far off from the hundreds of thousands of ringgit he was alleged to have received,' said the report. It was not known who made those allegations and what prompted the about-turn.    Protection payment takes a hit  As if that was not enough, Mahathir stirred up a third hornet's nest when he called for a review of the honorarium of the annual RM10,000 ($2,600) paid by the northern state of Penang to neighboring Kedah for the historical acquisition of Penang Island and the accompanying strip of land on mainland Penang known as Seberang Perai, formerly province Wellesley.   In the late 18th century, Kedah, under the rule of Sultan Abdullah, offered to lease Penang to England's East India Company in return for protection against possible attacks from Siam (now Thailand) and Burma (Myanmar) and future uprisings by his own relatives. English country trader Captain Francis Light representing the East India Company formally took possession of Penang Island in 1786. Seberang Perai was leased to the English in 1800. However, Sultan Abdullah discovered too late that the compensation and the 'protection' Kedah was to receive was much less than he had expected.   In calling for a review of the payment, also on June 17, Mahathir said the amount was no longer realistic. 'Kedah should ask Penang for a review of the payment,' he said. 'We must make a demand because with RM10,000, now you can't even buy a house, or else we ask that Penang and Seberang Perai be returned to us,' Mahathir said.   Those with longer memories were left puzzled as to why Mahathir was raising this issue now after stepping down last October after 22 years in power. They point out that when a request was made in 1994 for the payment to be increased to RM10 million, Mahathir himself had dismissed it. 'The royalty payment is only a condition ... it is history, and we are only continuing with what is history. It has become meaningless,' he said then. These critics also point out that subsequent historical events - Kedah becoming part of independent Malaya in 1957 and of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 - had superseded the earlier agreement with the British.    Water under the bridge  In another salvo, Mahathir also said Kedah should think about charging Penang for the raw water it had received for free over the years. He pointed out that Singapore and Malacca state had to pay their neighbor Johor for water 'but Kedah, a poor state at that, supplies raw water for free to a rich state like Penang.'   In a way, Mahathir's admission of Kedah being poor is an admission of his administration's failure to raise socio-economic conditions in the state, which remains among the poorest in the country. Penang, by contrast, is one of the most developed states, and its Penang Water Authority (PBA) is widely regarded as one of the most efficient, supplying the public with water at a price that is among the cheapest in the country.   It would not have escaped Mahathir's attention that the PBA's exemplary track record has cast other water authorities in the country in an unfavorable light.   'Water has become a commodity and every state government wants to make money from the sale of water,' says economist Charles Santiago, who noted that Kedah was also in the midst of privatizing its water resources. Penang, he said, has been profitable in water and 'what Mahathir was saying is that since you are profitable you pay for your water.'   But Santiago pointed out that the government had played a clear role in providing access to water as an important component of development, resulting in 95% of the Malaysian population having access to affordable, piped water.   Though both Kedah and Penang are governed by the ruling coalition, United Malays National Organization holds the reins in Kedah while its coalition partner, the multi-ethnic but Chinese-dominated Gerakan, leads the Penang government. Gerakan President Datuk Seri Dr Lim Keng Yaik holds the water portfolio in the federal cabinet, which was previously held by a staunch Mahathir loyalist, Samy Vellu, president of the Malaysian Indian Congress.   These unnecessary controversies are the last things current Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi needs as he seeks to distance himself from his predecessor. It only goes to show that, even in retirement, the former premier has a knack for ruffling feathers, whether international or domestic, and stirring emotions over the lack of transparency and accountability that characterized his administration. Perhaps after more than two decades in power, it was too much to expect Mahathir to lie low and confine himself to sailing, carpentry or horseback riding.   Source;  Asia Times Online Ltd.

"        HIGHLIGHTS    SOUTH KOREA – DEFENSE   S Korea cautious on US troop cuts    South Korean officials have responded cautiously to a US proposal to cut by a third its troops based in the country.    Officials said more negotiations were needed, and South Korea needed time to prepare 'countermeasures'.  China indicated that it welcomed the plan, saying it hoped it would contribute to regional stability. But South Korean opposition, civic groups and analysts said the relatively quick timescale for the pull-out could jeopardise security.   The US has proposed withdrawing 12,500 of its 37,000 troops by 2006.   The US has said it needs to modernise its forces, but the move may leave some South Koreans feeling vulnerable to North Korea.   'There still need to be negotiations,' Defence Minister Cho Young-kil said on Tuesday.  'In response to the US-presented broad idea, our idea is also going to prepare a countermeasure in a broad framework,' a government official said on condition of anonymity.  'I think the direction of our response will be decided this week after concluding a careful review of the US proposal and collecting various opinions,' he said.  The main opposition Grand National Party was less sanguine, calling the US plan 'shocking and surprising'.  'The number of troops Washington wants to cut came as no surprise, but the timing is rather faster than expected,' Professor Kim Tae-hyo at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security told The Korea Herald.   The Pentagon says its commitment to defend the South will not be affected and the use of longer-range weapons and better technology will compensate for the reduction in numbers.  But the South does not want big changes until the resolution of the dispute over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons, says the BBC's correspondent in Seoul, Charles Scanlon. It would prefer the pull-out to happen gradually over 10 years.   Plans are already under way to redeploy the US troops, which will remain in South Korea, and the two sides held a second day of Future of the Alliance talks on that issue in Seoul on Tuesday.   At present nearly half the 37,000 US troops in South Korea are stationed north of Seoul, a throwback to the 1950-53 Korean War.   Their forward position puts them in range of North Korean artillery and US officials have said that pulling troops back south of the capital would strengthen the military's hand.  The US also wants to move the main US army headquarters from its current location in central Seoul to free up money for better military technology and infrastructure.

The figures confirm police reports that demonstrations within China are growing in size and number, and becoming better organised.  The report, in Outlook magazine, blames dissatisfaction with government policy.  The main problems, it says, are wage disputes, social welfare problems, the restructuring of state-owned enterprises, and evictions.  These problems amount to a list of the fallout from China's reform process.  Many protests in China happen far from the public eye, but these figures show they are on the rise.   The Ministry of Public Security says last year there were more than 58,000 'mass incidents' -the term they use to describe public protests - involving three million people: that is an increase of almost 15% over the year before.   Western experts say that as protests increase, Chinese police are trying different strategies to contain them, sometimes even making economic concessions to demonstrators - moves that may even encourage others to stage protests.  And one Western academic has warned that, when it comes to the growing unrest, China's leaders will face riskier dilemmas than at any time since the massive protests in 1989.

The move comes after the communist country sentenced several dissidents to long prison terms over the past two years for using the Internet to criticize the government and promote democracy.  The Ministry of Culture and Information last week instructed the People's Committees in all 64 city and provincial governments to closely monitor all online information, a ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Under the new regulations, part of government policy announced in March, Internet cafe owners can be fined or jailed for allowing clients to download or send 'bad information' on the Internet, the official said.  That includes allowing access to sites ranging from those deemed pornographic to those accused of disseminating state secrets. Internet cafe owners must also document what Web sites their clients visit and for how long, and all users must present identification cards before logging on. There are an estimated 5,000 Internet cafes in Vietnam. About 4 million people out of Vietnam's population of 81 million regularly use the Internet.

Labour Regains Voter Support After Budget, TV3 Poll Shows    June 6 (New Zealand's governing Labour party, buoyed by a big-spending budget, regained its lead over the main opposition National party, according to a poll conducted for TV3 News in Auckland.   Voter support for Labour rose to 43 percent from 42 percent in March. National fell to 40 percent from 42 percent, according to the poll results, which were e-mailed to Bloomberg News.   Labour last month pledged NZ$14.1 billion ($8.8 billion) of new spending the next three years aimed at boosting the income of families and encouraging more people into work. The government hasn't led in the TV3 poll since January.  In February, National took the lead in the poll for the first time since October 1996 after leader Don Brash attacked the government for policies he said favor native Maoris over other New Zealanders.   Clark remains most preferred prime minister with 35 percent support from Brash with 26 percent support, according to the TV3 poll of 1,000 voters. The poll was carried out from May 27 to June 3 by Auckland-based TNS and has a margin of error of 3.1 percent.  Separately, consumer confidence was unchanged after falling in March to its lowest since April last year, according to the poll. The proportion of people expecting the economy to improve the next three months was steady at 40 percent. Still, 30 percent expect the economy to deteriorate from 28 percent in March.

The ANZ job ads series, which counts the number of ads in metropolitan newspapers, fell 2.8 per cent in May.  But the drop followed an exceptional year of employment growth and also masked a rise in the use of internet advertising, where ad numbers have risen 51 per cent since May last year. ANZ measured a monthly rise of 3.4 per cent if newspaper and internet ads were measured together. The rival Olivier internet job ads survey recorded a monthly rise of 4.7 per cent. Scott Haslem, an economist with UBS, said forward indicators such as the job ads surveys suggested unemployment would soon fall to its lowest rate since 1981.  Tony Meer, an economist with Deutsche Bank, said Australia, Britain and New Zealand were on the cusp of a historic demographic shift that would create a labour shortage over the next 10 years.   'By the end of this year, or early next year, we'll have an unemployment rate in the low 5s or high 4s,' he said. 'You have to go back well over three decades ago to find a sustainable unemployment rate below that.' Unemployment was last at 5.6 per cent in 1989, before the 1990 recession, but has not fallen consistently below that mark since the mid-1970s. In 1981 the unemployment rate dipped briefly to 5.4 per cent.  Robert Olivier, a director of the Olivier Group recruitment firm, said the labour market was looking increasingly like a sellers' market. 'Employers are finding it increasingly difficult to attract top candidates,' he said. 'It also means there will be pressure on organisations to raise salaries in their June reviews.'  Ninety per cent of jobs created in the 12 months to April were full-time, said the federal Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews. He was responding to a report in yesterday's Herald that said more than half of all jobs created in the past 16 years had gone to casual workers, and more than a quarter of workers were employed on a casual basis.  Casuals were 'an essential and legitimate part of a flexible labour market', he said, adding that they received loadings of up to 30 per cent above normal wages to compensate for the lack of entitlements. Mr Andrews warned that if a Labor government was elected it would force employers to pay casual workers for sick leave, holidays and redundancies - a move that would force businesses to lay off staff.  Labor's workplace relations spokesman, Craig Emerson, described Mr Andrews's claims as 'another Liberal lie'.  'Labor policy is to give regular, long-term casuals the choice to request a conversion to permanent employment with employers being able to say no if it's reasonable to do so,' he said. Mr Emerson said the ABS definition of full-time work included casual and permanent full-time employees. The most recent ABS survey of casual employment showed almost 45 per cent of new jobs created between August 2002 and August 2003 were casual.

'Yields can rise when the economy is getting better and they can also rise when the credibility of JGBs [Japanese government bonds] is deteriorating,' he told journalists. 'I do not see the yield rise as negative at all. Rather I see it as a positive sign.' On Tuesday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB rose three basis points to 1.7 per cent, its highest since early 2001 when the Bank of Japan began its current ultra-loose monetary policy.  Mr Takenaka was reacting to investor concern about the danger a sharp rise in long-term interest rates could pose as the economy recovers and as inflationary expectations gradually take hold.  Pessimists worry that rising interest rates could cause problems on a number of fronts, making it harder for the government to service its debt, raising private borrowing costs, and reducing the value of bond holdings held by commercial banks. Hajime Takata, chief strategist of Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, said there was a possibility that long-term interest rates would overshoot, damaging the economy and causing big losses for institutions holding government bonds.  Mr Takata, who has long warned of the dangers of a collapse in the government bond market, said the risks of bond market turbulence became more acute as the economy pulled out of its long deflationary phase.  'This is like a prisoner dilemma situation,' he said. 'With 97 per cent of government bonds held by Japanese, Japanese people have no way of escaping from the interest rate risk.' He said the government should adopt a policy to minimise the risks, issuing more floating-rate bonds and, perhaps, getting the Bank of Japan to buy more long-term JGBs. Peter Tasker, consultant economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said such fears were exaggerated. Bond yields were rising, he said, because the prospects for nominal growth and inflation were improving, precisely what Japan had long been waiting for. Any negative impact caused by falling bond prices, Mr Tasker said, would be more than compensated for by stronger growth and rising equity prices.  Economists said that, even if banks, which have been big purchasers of government bonds, suffered losses on their fixed-income portfolios, they would be able to compensate by gaining wider spreads on lending. Regional banks' balance sheets are more skewed to bonds than the big city banks, which are still big holders of equity.  Economists were also not unduly alarmed at the higher interest rate payment that the government might face on refinancing public debt, now about 140 per cent of gross domestic product. As bond yields rose, so would the tax take, they said. Nonetheless, the government said it remained vigilant against excessive interest rate rises. Sadakazu Tanigaki, finance minister, said: 'We need to watch movements in long-term interest rates closely.'  Mr Tanigaki also said the ministry would continue to diversify its bond issuance. The government has held two auctions of inflation-linked bonds, both of them heavily oversubscribed.

From the burial sites the walls, oracles and advanced buildings and graves are discovered and the oracles reading 'Duke of Zhou (Zhou Gong)' appeared many times there.  After a number of on-site investigations, researches and discussions carried out by many famous archeologists the Western Zhou large burial site has received wide attention and was regarded as belonging quite likely to the family of the Duke of Zhou. This greatest archeological discovery as such ever since the founding of new China proves immeasurably precious to the research on China's civilization and for carrying on and developing China's excellent traditional culture.   The large Western Zhou burial site is located in the ruins of the Duke Zhou Temple in Qishan County of Shaanxi Province. Archeological team composed of Shaanxi Archeology Institute and Peking University, has discovered 19 large graves: nine with four grave tunnels, four with three and two respectively and two with one grave tunnel. There are another 13 funerary pits. Over 700 oracle bone pieces were discovered outside the graves, 420-word oracle identified, four slates with characters reading 'Duke of Zhou' ever found, over 1500-meter-long wall and sites of foundations of six large buildings of rammed earth.   After three days of careful investigation Professor Zou Heng from Peking University said, it is the only large community of Zhou people, in which the Western Zhou walls, oracles, advanced buildings were all discovered ever since the archeological activities on the Western Zhou Dynasty were started over 70 years ago. That referring to the Duke of Zhou appeared many times on oracle bones indicates that the site is the feud of Duke Zhou and the burial site belongs to his family. The 78-year-old Zou, dubbed 'No.1 archeologist on China's Shang and Zhou dynasties', is the discoverer of the capital ruins of the States of Yan and Jin of the Western Zhou Dynasty and instructor for exploring and excavating Lord Jin's grave of the Western Zhou Dynasty.   Yin Shengping, former curator of Shaanxi History Museum, a noted expert in Western Zhou history, said, king-level graves discovered previously only had one or two tunnels, and it is the first time for us to discover four-grave-tunnel graves in the feud of the Duke Zhou. Duke Zhou was a person honored as King of Zhou and is fully qualified to use the funeral treatment of the highest level. It is no wonder that graves with four tunnels were discovered in his family burial site.   Named Dan and surnamed Ji, Duke Zhou is the founder of Zhou Dynasty, and once assisted King Zhou Wu and afterwards serving as regent for seven years, he gave the power back to King Zhou Cheng. He initiated feudalistic system, and formulated the rites and composed music, thus laid the political and cultural foundation of the Chinese nation. Confucius turned his thought more humanized and worldly, and on the basis he formed the Confucianism, which has been passed on for thousands of years, becoming the most fundamental cultural tradition in Chinese society. 'Dreaming of Duke Zhou' still remains a catchword nowadays.   Doctor Zhang Tian'en, director of Shang and Zhou Office of Shaanxi Archeology Institute who devoted for years to seeking tombs for kings of the Western Zhou, held that the title of Duke Zhou is hereditary and lasted for five to six hundred years. Although Zhou Gongdan's eldest son was given the State of Lu in the east but Western Zhou practiced the system of returned burial, i.e. one must be buried in the mother town when he died. As descendents of Duke Zhou given provincial enfeoffment must also be buried in the family graveyards, therefore, many graves appeared with four tomb-tunnels.   Researcher Yuan Zhongyi, former curator of Qinshihuang Terracotta and Horses Museum, said, the size of the four-tunnel graves are generally a bit small, so they are not likely to be of the graves for kings but more likely to be graves of the family of Duke Zhou. As to whom they actually belong, that depends on the final determination after excavation.

The Unicef says as many as 70,000 Indonesian children have been sold across the country's borders as sex commodities. They are employed in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Similarly, nearly half of the 400,000 estimated sex workers in Indonesia are children under 18 years old.  This grim reality has mostly been ignored, buried deep in local newspapers. In this instance, it is the lack of discussion about the problem that is disturbing. That is, until unique cases like the most recent arrest of a 'madam' emerged. Twenty-seven-year-old Arum was arrested last month for operating a network of prostitutes from her humble food stall in a densely populated neighbourhood in South Jakarta. Reports said she had recruited girls, mostly students between the ages of 14 and 16, to work for her by first luring them to buy items from her, on credit. These included mobile phones, clothes and shoes.  When the girls ended up with huge debts, she then made them escort older men. The girls would meet their customers in the daytime, after school, before going home. Arum's case was special, as she did not operate in a typical 'lokalisasi' or red-light district area.  A report by the Jakarta office of the International Labour Organisation-International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (ILO-Ipec) said a large number of children in the country are trapped in the worst forms of child labour, mainly prostitution. These children come from both urban and rural areas. Poverty is the trigger in most cases. Government reports say between three million and six million children had been left, without parental care, to eke out a living after the 1997 economic crisis.  In some rural areas, parents are also known to sell their children for money to recruits for the sex industry.  Yet it is the large cross-border syndicates, which recruit girls through deceptive means, that are running a lucrative business of prostitution and people trafficking in an industry that generates millions of rupiah a year in the country. With the authorities, such as some police and immigration officials, on their payroll, the syndicates target Indonesia as a place for recruitment as well as a destination for sex tourists. Activists point out the government's glaring lack of effort to tackle this problem. The government last year came up with a national plan to combat the trafficking of women and children.  But with a lack of capacity and resources, the plan was criticised as just 'lip service'. For instance, there is no budget to implement the plan.  'If we want to fight organised crime groups that are making a lot of money, we have to be willing to spend some money,' said Mr Aris Merdeka Sirait, the secretary-general of the National Commission on Children Protection, in Jakarta recently. The government has drafted a law that mandates severe punishment for exploiters of children. But the enforcers, either out of lack of knowledge or collusion with the suspects, often ignore the law and prosecute the cases using the regular criminal code. For activists like Mr Aris, nothing is more frustrating than seeing the stacks of cases they submit to the police receive little follow-up.  'We get hundreds of cases and data on child prostitution, but if you'd ask me a year later how many of those have been successfully prosecuted, you'd be disappointed to hear the answer,' he said.  The government only started to act when people began talking about the country's corruption problem. So, until more people start talking about it, this problem of teen prostitutes will see little change.

Yet opinions vary considerably as to how this Divine Will should be actualized.    Cut off from centuries of classical Islamic and legal scholarship, which requires one to understand not just Arabic but the context and evolution of Islamic history in the first place to be able to render a sound juristic verdict, the legal sensibility of Muslims has been severely compromised.   Muslims in Malaysia, not unlike those in the Middle East, have resorted to appreciating Islam through the narrow prism of al Halal wal Haram fil Islam - which means abiding by the 'lawful and prohibited acts in Islam', and which is detailed in a book of the same name by Yusuf Qaradawi.   In this philosophy, submission to God is reduced to a series of dos and don'ts - a binary moral code. This approach was systematized by Qaradawi, dean of Islamic law at Qatar University, and the methodology gained currency in the Middle East, and subsequently in Southeast Asia.   Since 1960, when Qaradawi wrote his book in Arabic, his narrow approach toward Islam has predominated. In Malaysia, his influence is deep, even among the governing Muslim elites. When former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim was the president of the International Islamic University, Malaysia, he spent considerable time with Qaradawi, expressing his support for the latter's fiqh al aliyyah (introducing Islamic law according to priorities).   In his governmental post of deputy to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Anwar was able to bring some of Qaradawi's ideas into public policy. Eventually Anwar was dumped from the government and jailed on charges of sodomy and corruption; however, the thoughts and practice of Qaradawi have not been totally excluded from government policy, including the reductionist elements.   Islamic scholars and thinkers in Malaysia continue to look to Qaradawi for various Islamic interpretations and verdicts, such as on the legality of suicide terrorism. More important, the inspiration of Qaradawi is integral to the conceptual blueprint for an Islamic state as held by the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS), which controls the Kelantan state government.  PAS's Islamic state is based on the permissible and the prohibited as outlined by Qaradawi. Observe the 'Islamic state document' produced by PAS last year, the first of its kind in the history of the party, after much demand from Malaysians as to what a PAS-style Islamic state would actually represent.   In this document, it was clearly stated that PAS would implement 'the Shariah [Islamic law] to achieve the five imperatives of the Shariah; therein to protect a Muslim's beliefs, life, intellect, dignity and property'.   In seeking to fulfill these five imperatives, the document read: 'In implementing the Shariah all vices and crimes that pertain to the above stated aspects would be controlled. Man-made laws have been [proved] a failure in securing the security and dignity of the human race.'   From this line of reasoning, it is clear that punitive logic is not far from the implementation of Shariah as envisaged by PAS.   In fact, despite promising to keep true to the five objectives, what is known as Maqasid al-Shariah, PAS is totally silent on the jurisprudential methodology and tradition that would be employed on how these objectives can be fulfilled.   Yet anyone who is vaguely informed on Shariah is aware that the recourse to different methods or schools of thought on Shariah - whether it be mazhab Shafii (as is customary in Malaysia and Indonesia) or mazhab Maliki (as is common in Northern Africa) - can produce variations to each law.   PAS stated that the reason for the creation of an Islamic state is a Fardhu Ain (necessary Islamic obligation). To justify the creation of an Islamic state, PAS quoted the Islamic maxim: 'Something becomes obligatory if an obligatory injunction fails to be fulfilled without it.'   Going by the above assertion, Islamic law, in the words of M B Hooker, an Islamic-law specialist based in Australian National University, is a creature of 'executive institution', something that the Islamic state must create.   Hence, rather than based on Islamic scholasticism, where religious scholars debate on each point of law before it is deployed or introduced, it is now the Islamic state that will decide how Islamic laws are best made.   It is in this context that Parvez Manzoor, a Muslim scholar based in Stockholm University, argues that the Islamic state can become an 'all-watchful Hegelian state'. This is because it carries within it the administrative, theological and bureaucratic reach, to sanction and approve every mode of behavior.   How one practices Islam in Malaysia, according to PAS, should boil down to observing the prescriptions (the dos) and proscriptions (the don'ts) of the Islamic state, and the kind of restrictive Shariah conceived by it. Therefore, the intermingling of men and women is banned, as are art events deemed offensive.   Although Islamists inspired by the clarity of Qaradawi's work often point to the validity of his approach, since there is a phrase in the Koran that encourages Muslims 'to advocate virtue and forbid vice', they fail to note that even Qaradawi himself openly acknowledged the difficult and unprecedented nature of reducing Islam to a set of positive and negative deeds.   That this warning is not heeded is largely due to a shallow understanding of Islamic history, combined with even poorer understanding of Islamic law, and the methods with which laws are derived.   In seeking to create an Islamic state to police and punish, the very position of Islam itself is made controversial, especially in a modern and multiracial society such as Malaysia, where up to half of the population are non-Muslims.   Due to the tendency to assume that a punitive Islamic state is the norm, when Islamists in Malaysia do propose a legislative agenda, they are often predisposed to an approach that rarely questions the spirit and ethics laden in Shariah to satisfy the five imperatives.   Rather, the jurisprudence is based on sanctions and injunctions of the Islamic faith, which in fact is the most simplistic, if not crudest, rendition of Islam into contemporary context.   Herein lies the irony in Malaysia: Despite the clarion call of PAS to create an Islamic society guided by moral awareness, the current approach dilutes it. Instead, it is heavily tilted toward creating an all-powerful Islamic state rather than one fostered on ethical precepts.  Nevertheless, it remains PAS's contention that an Islamic state must come into existence first before an ethical Islamic society could come to be. Morality, in other words, comes after power.   Although the ruling party of Malaysia, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), is arguably 'softer' on the importance of Islamic state, even its Islamization program is not without punitive elements, in some cases even on par with PAS. Islamic laws passed by states ruled by UMNO have been just as strong and harsh.   The only way out for Malaysia is for scholars and students of Islam to be more sensitive to the context of Islamic history, rather than to adopt it wholesale, as is the preferred approach in Islamic institutes and universities thus far. Unless Islamists in Malaysia combine a perceptive reading of Islamic history and Islamic jurisprudence, the reliance on a punitive approach will continue to predominate.

"       TIMOR LOROSAE – INTERNAL AFFAIRS   Former E. Timor governor to start jail term Friday over 1999 atrocities    A former East Timor governor who was convicted of human rights abuses during the territory's bloody 1999 breakaway from Indonesia will begin serving a three-year sentence later this week, his lawyer said Wednesday.   Prosecutors were expected to take Abilio Soares to a special prison cell at Jakarta's Cipinang prison on Friday, said lawyer Otto Cornelis Kaligis.  Soares, an ethnic Timorese appointed by Jakarta, will be the first to go to prison out of six people who were ordered jailed by an Indonesian human rights court last year.  Three army officers, a former Dili police chief and a militia leader remain free pending appeals. The Supreme Court recently rejected Soares' appeal.  The rights court acquitted 11 security force members and one civilian over the Indonesian army-backed militia violence against independence supporters which cost at least 1,400 lives.  Soares has complained he is a scapegoat.  'Prosecutors told the human rights court on Monday about their plan to put him to jail. Abilio then said 'Why don't you shoot me to death instead?'' Kaligis said, quoting his client Soares.  Kaligis said Soares believed he had been made a scapegoat for the military and police since 'not a single prosecuted police officer is serving a jail term' for the 1999 attacks.

Mr Karzai enjoys most support among the predominantly ethnic Pashtun population in eastern Afghanistan, where 92 per cent of people approved of his performance. But the president's approval rating dropped to 20 per cent in the north-west and 35 per cent among southern Pashtuns. The results of the survey of 804 people, sponsored by the Asia Foundation and conducted in the spring, came days after the Afghan electoral commission announced presidential elections on October 9. Eight out of 10 Afghans surveyed said they wanted to vote in elections, but 87 per cent said women would need their husband's permission and 18 per cent of men said they would not allow their wives to vote. Security was what most worried 40 per cent of the people polled, followed by the economy, which 29 per cent of interviewees said topped their list of concerns.

Correspondents say this is an important step forward in ending the long-running crisis which has left Cambodia without a proper government for nearly a year.  Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP) won last year's general election, but without enough seats to rule alone.   After long months of negotiations, the CPP finally struck a deal with the royalist Funcinpec party last month.   The widely-revered king is in self-imposed exile in North Korea, after being sidelined throughout the 11-month political deadlock.  He had earlier refused to sign the bill to allow Hun Sen's reappointment, and analysts say his change of heart could be a sign that he is willing to support the political process again.  '(I) appoint Hun Sen as the Prime Minister of the royal government of Cambodia,' the king wrote in a document signed on Wednesday.   'The Prime Minister has the duty to propose forming of government and seek the approval from the National Assembly.'   The appointment gives Hun Sen his third elected term. He has already been prime minister for almost 20 years, making him one of the world's longest serving leaders.  The move should also clear the way for a new government to be formed.    Stalled schedule   The lengthy political wrangling has already prevented Cambodia from taking some important actions, including preparation to join the World Trade Organization and concluding plans for a genocide trial to try former Khmer Rouge leaders.   But despite Wednesday's announcement, the political skirmishes seem far from over.  On Tuesday Cambodia's acting head of state, Chea Sim - who is also head of the CPP - left the country for what was officially termed 'health reasons'.  But he is thought to have refused to sign the bill to endorse Hun Sen as prime minister, and opposition groups say that troops and police had surrounded Chea Sim's house to force him to leave.

During a lively question-and-answer session, Tung made it clear that despite the July 1 protests he still believes China knows best when it comes to democracy.  ``I identify with the central government that its arrangement [on universal suffrage] is for the good of the long-term interests of Hong Kong,'' he said in response to sharp questioning from The Frontier's Emily Lau. She was demanding to know why Tung would not serve as an advocate for Hong Kong people who want to see full democracy here in time for the 2007-08 electoral cycle. Hong Kong, Tung said, has to see things from Beijing's standpoint. ``How will Hong Kong's development affect the interests of our country and the safety and well-being of our mainland compatriots?   ``We have to take into account our country's point of view. This is the basic principle,'' he said. While the policy gulf between Tung and the political opposition remains as great as ever, yesterday's session lacked the vitriol of past exchanges. Tung, in a deep blue suit and a crimson tie, appeared relaxed and even cracked the odd joke with lawmakers. Addressing this group of legislators for the last time, he expressed thanks for their work.   ``Everyone says that I am nostalgic. I am indeed nostalgic. I sincerely hope that I will be able to see most of you here again in October.'' Elections in September will return a new council, with 30 of the 60 seats filled by direct election and the remainder from more conservative functional constituencies.  Pro-democrat parties are hoping to gain a majority in the next Legco and to use the body to push a reform agenda on Beijing. In April, the National People's Congress Standing Committee ruled that universal suffrage could not be granted in Hong Kong by 2007-08 and gave no timetable for further changes in the political structure.  In yesterday's session, democrats called on Tung to fight for democracy, but he said that under the Basic Law, he was accountable to the central government.  ``After the NPC Standing Committee makes a decision, the chief executive has a statutory duty to implement the decision and be accountable to the central government,'' he said. Tung said he had no power to demand that Beijing overturn its decision.  ``If you continue to take this attitude, aren't you worried that you are planting a time bomb for your administration?'' democrat Andrew Cheng asked. ``Mr Tung, how many people do you want to see marching in the streets before you line up with them and urge the central government to give us democracy?''  Tung said he had relayed Hong Kong people's aspirations to the central government, but that was all he could do. Liberal Party leader James Tien lowered the heat of the debate when he asked Tung to help democrats obtain home-return permits to visit the mainland. Tien joked that he would especially like his opponents in the hotly contested New Territories East constituency - Andrew Cheng and Emily Lau - get permits that would allow them to stay away the entire campaign period. ``Allow them to visit the mainland until September 13 [the day after the Legco elections], that will be very good,'' he joked.  ``You all have to be careful. The Liberal Party and the chief executive are conspiring together,'' Tung answered, causing loud laughter in the chamber.

US state department spokesman Richard Boucher said Uzbekistan had made some encouraging progress over the past year on human rights, but Washington was disappointed by a lack of progress towards democracy.  Mr Boucher added that the US still wanted to co-operate with the country.  Uzbekistan has received tens of millions of dollars in US aid since 2001, when, after the September 11 attacks, it allowed American forces to use an airbase near the Afghan border.  Last month US officials said Uzbekistan's overall human rights record remained very poor, referring to what it described as serious abuses and deaths under detention.

Consumer sentiment rising to a 10-year high and a report yesterday showing business confidence rebounded in June, have increased the likelihood the Reserve Bank of Australia will lift rates for the first time this year, boosting the appeal of local assets.   ``The jump in consumer confidence has increased the possibility of a rate hike this year,'' said Lawrie Dryden, head of currency and asset allocation in Sydney at State Street Global Advisors, which manages $33 billion. ``It's added to reasons'' to buy ``the Australian dollar.''   Australia's dollar bought 72.53 U.S. cents at 5:00 p.m. in Sydney, from 72.45 cents late in Asia yesterday, when the currency rose as high as 72.85, the strongest since May 7.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has kept its target cash rate at 5.25 percent this year amid signs spending and borrowing had slowed, following two rate increases late in 2003.   Futures traders increased bets the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates later this year. The implied yield on the December 90-day bank bill futures rose to 5.59 percent from 5.56 percent yesterday. The December contract traded at an average yield of 55 basis points above the central bank's overnight cash rate in the past year.   The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 23 economists is for a quarter-percentage point rate rise by March next year. Nine economists forecast an increase this year.    Consumers   The consumer confidence index rose 4.5 percent from June to 119.5, the highest since July 1994, according to a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey released in Sydney. A reading above 100 shows optimists outnumber pessimists. From a year earlier, sentiment gained 2.9 percent.   ``This can be good for the Australian dollar,'' as it ``means more spending and a healthier economy,'' said Stephen Koukoulas, chief strategist at TD Securities Ltd. in Sydney.   A report yesterday showed business confidence rebounded last month from a one-year low, spurred by extra consumer spending after the government paid out a total of A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) to some families in June as a tax benefit.   Australian government bonds were lower across all maturities. The 6.25 percent bond maturing in April 2015 fell 0.189, or A$1.89 per A$1,000 face amount, to 103.963, pushing the yield 2 basis points higher to 5.75 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.   ``With consumer sentiment at a record high the bond market is concerned this tips the balance toward a rate hike at some stage,'' said Warren Hogan, chief economist and head of bond strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston in Sydney.    Retail Sales   Australia's dollar, also known as the Aussie, will extend gains should U.S. retail sales meet expectations later today, said Robert Rennie, currency strategist in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. The currency will rise to 73 to 73.5 cents this week, he said.   Any signs of a slowing economy may encourage the Federal Reserve to raise its interest-rate target for overnight loans between banks at a ``measured'' pace. The gap between Australian and U.S. interest rates narrowed to 4 percent last month.  U.S. retail sales dropped 0.8 percent in June following a rise of 1.2 percent in May, according to the median estimate of 68 economist surveyed by Bloomberg News. Excluding vehicles, sales probably rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.7 percent the previous month.   ``Our economist sees the ex-auto component of retail sales falling 0.2 percent,'' said Rennie.   ``We therefore expect more U.S. dollar weakness and arguably this will be supportive for the Aussie as well.''

The agency, the Korea Development Institute, lowered its 2004 growth forecast to 5.2 percent from an April estimate of 5.5 percent, it said in a quarterly report released in Seoul. Morgan Stanley cut its projection to 4.6 percent from 4.9 percent. The central bank and investment banks including Citigroup, ING Groep and UBS have also trimmed growth forecasts in recent weeks. Growth more than halved to 3.1 percent last year as South Koreans were forced to cut spending after a credit binge left many unable to meet their debt payments. One in 13 of the nation's 48 million people were three months or more behind on interest payments at the end of May.  'Korea's domestic demand is weaker than we previously thought and is likely to stage a weaker recovery in 2005,' Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a report. 'The high level of household debt continues to weigh down consumption, while strong exports have not translated into domestic demand.'  The government predicts that the economy will expand about 5 percent in 2004, less than the 6 percent target it set itself at the start of the year, and the Bank of Korea is forecasting 5.2 percent growth. The bank last week cut its second-half estimate to 5 percent from 5.6 percent.  The state agency said it expected consumer spending, which makes up more than half of South Korea's economy, to rise 0.7 percent this year, less than its April prediction for a 3.3 percent increase. Corporate investment in plant and machinery is expected to climb 6.1 percent, compared with 8.5 percent previously, it said.  The Korea Development Institute lowered its second-quarter economic growth estimate to 5.7 percent from 6.1 percent, its quarterly report showed.

Victims were drowned or trapped under landslides, which covered their homes in Niigata prefecture, according to local officials.  More than 400mm (16 inches) of rain have fallen in the region since Monday night, and more is feared.   Local authorities have requested military help in the rescue operation.  Residents have been seen shovelling mud out of their homes, and many roads remain blocked. Some were said to be choked by falling telephone poles and trees.  Japan's Meteorological Agency said more heavy rain was likely. Parts of Niigata are forecast to receive another 160mm of rainfall by Thursday morning.  The rain has already broken records for the Niigata region.  Many elderly people have been affected by the floods, with some forced to await rescue on upper storeys of buildings or rooftops.   The five who died were said to be aged between 72 and 83:   - In Sanjo, one man died when his house flooded   - Two women were found dead in the same town, one in a flooded field and the other near local government offices   - A farmer died after a mudslide destroyed his house in Tochio   - A woman was found dead in Izumozaki after her house was destroyed by a landslide.  On Tuesday, military helicopters reportedly rescued 66 children from their nursery school in Nakanoshima.  'I was scared,' a little girl told Reuters news agency. 'When I looked out of the window, it looked like a river out there.'  About 1,000 children were forced to spend the night inside their schools.

Microsoft said it would contest the decision.   Toshihiro Hara, an official with the Fair Trade Commission, said the warning was the first in the world against the clause, which he said in effect prevented Japanese computer makers from demanding damages or royalty fees even when rivals violated patents for important technology.   Such concerns have increased over the past several years as Japanese manufacturers add consumer-electronics features to Windows-installed computers, Hara said.   'There are concerns the clause may discourage motivation to develop audiovisual technology and may hinder fair competition in that technological field in our nation,' he added.  . Although the commission is not certain patents have been violated, it said several major Japanese makers suspected such violations and have objected to the provision since December 2000. Hara refused to give the makers' names.   Microsoft said it had omitted the conditions from new contracts. The Redmond, Washington based company also maintained that the disputed provisions were legal under Japanese, U.S. and European Union law.   'We have also been offering a different type of contract that does not include the provision and we are not forcing the provision to PC makers,' said Takashi Hirano, an executive officer at Microsoft's Japan unit. 'It is regrettable that the FTC did not recognize these points.'   Microsoft is willing to go to court if it does not get a satisfactory result at the FTC hearing, Hirano said.   Analysts said Japanese authorities were trying to curb possibly monopolistic behavior in an effort to give more opportunities to alternatives such as the open-source Linux software system.   The European Commission found in March that Microsoft abused its 'near monopoly' with Windows software.   In the United States, an appeals court last month approved a landmark antitrust settlement that Microsoft negotiated with the Justice Department.   Source;  AP, Reuters.

The world's second most populous country has one of the highest infection rates - and more than five million HIV/Aids cases.  To counteract the spread of the virus, the government recently launched its biggest anti-Aids initiative to date. But efforts are hampered by the fact that most Indians still find sex and Aids taboo subjects.    Stigma   In a corner of the St Katherine's Home in Bombay (Mumbai) a group of children are enjoying their playtime. But despite their singing and laughter these are not typical five-year-olds - all of them are HIV positive.  They were infected by their parents before they were born and were brought here sick and, in some cases, close to death. In a society where families are the main source of support, they are looked after by nurses and nuns.  Sister Shanti has 30 children in her care at this orphanage.  She says the hardest part for her is when people turn their back on children as young as these.  'It disturbs me when people discriminate against them.  'They have this disease through no fault of their own. They too have a right to live,' she says.    Ignorance   For years many in India ignored the growing threat of Aids. Many simply could not imagine it was something that could affect them.  Down a crowded street in the heart of Bombay is the Unison clinic, one of the few in the city that deals with HIV patients.  Ram Kewar is on one of his regular visits - he is among 20 HIV-infected people who come here every day.  He was infected by the virus a few years ago and since then has passed it on to members of his family.  He says he had never even heard of the disease, far less about how it can be transmitted.  'I thought it was just my fate to have got it. It was only much later that I found out why it had happened to me.'  The new Indian government has identified Aids as one of its priorities.  But the biggest problem is combating ignorance - and that includes people who are very influential.  Sanjay Nirupam is a politician belonging to the right-wing Shiv Sena party, an ally of the former Indian government and the main opposition party in Bombay.  He believes the issue is being overplayed.  'One always hears about Aids and how it's this big problem. But I have personally never come across anyone with Aids or seen anyone dying of the disease,' he says.  'I think it's just hype.'    Taboo topic   But it's a problem, which is not just confined to the poor or uneducated, or even the conservative.  It spreads across Indian society.  In a trendy Bombay cafe young men and women draw on cigarettes and sip long cocktails.  They are part of cosmopolitan Bombay's elite - upwardly mobile, liberal and well-informed.  This is one section of Indians who are more open to talking about Aids - but they would never think of doing so at home.  'It has to do with sex and that's something which is an absolute taboo,' says twenty-something Rocky Bhatia.  'Most families simply will not bring it up.'    Sign of hope   But there's hope at the other end of the social divide. Falkland Road right in the heart of the city is Bombay's red light district. For years activists have worked closely with the sex workers operating out of tiny rooms and filthy alleyways off this busy street. It's a move that is now paying dividends. Monica is a sex-worker who has seen many of her colleagues die.  In the past decade, Aids has claimed the lives of thousands of sex workers. Now they are learning to be more careful. Volunteers regularly visit every brothel handing out boxes of condoms and carrying out regular medical tests.  'If a customer refuses to use a condom we return his money and turn him away,' says Monica.  'It doesn't matter how much money he offers us. Our lives are more important.'  It is a small sign of success for a problem that needs to be tackled on a much larger scale.  Otherwise, it is estimated that in the next 10 years India could have more Aids cases than all of Africa.

Not very, as another PM is sworn in, for the interim.  It can now be said unequivocally: Pakistan has a revolving-door democracy; PMs come and go, the President calls the shots. Just glance at last week's events in Islamabad. Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned (read: was sacked), Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain was appointed his successor. This is for an interim period during which the military establishment will find a safe seat from where to get 'miracle man' and finance minister Shaukat Aziz elected to the National Assembly. Then Hussain will resign to let Aziz replace him. But rumour is that even this revolving door will be closed permanently, and a presidential form of government ushered in.   Musharraf's choice of Aziz symbolises his deep distrust of the political class. As a technocrat who served the Saudi royal family and princes of the uae, and also worked with the World Bank in Washington, Aziz is expected to be indifferent to the country's democratic aspirations. But already the members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q have started to ask: can Aziz find a safe seat from where he can get elected to the National Assembly?  The speculation has been sparked because PML-Q president Hussain did not mention Aziz in his speech of thanks after he was elected leader of the National Assembly (that is, in effect, the PM). He subsequently made amends at a party meeting after the presidency called reminding him of the script he, Jamali and Musharraf had agreed upon. Hussain has also been requesting the media not to refer to him as 'interim PM'. Reason: the Constitution does not recognise such a post.  The whisper campaign against Aziz has a sharp edge: his detractors say he belongs to the Ahmadi sect, declared non-Muslim here, and consequently can't be PM. Urdu dailies even headlined this rumour, goading Aziz into publicly denying it. His proximity to Washington has riled the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), an alliance of right-wing Islamist parties. With Musharraf already toeing Washington's line, Pakistan, MMA leaders say, will now have a PM whose thinking is anything but 'home-grown'.  MMA leader Qazi Hussain fired the first salvo saying, 'The nomination of Aziz is a contempt of not only Parliament but the whole nation.' MMA leaders say they are wary of Aziz because he will do Washington's bidding and roll back Pakistan's nuclear programme. Worse, Aziz's antecedents have prompted the Lahore High Court Bar Association to resolve that it will oppose him as PM due to his propensity to promote the US economic agenda.  Musharraf can sell Aziz to Washington and London as the man of 'western values' who is largely credited with having pulled Pakistan out of an economic quagmire. In reality, though, he is a 'non-political face' of Jamali, appointed to defend the President in the National Assembly. Indeed, Jamali was ousted because he would rarely intervene in the National Assembly debates, which routinely ripped apart every policy of the army headquarters.  As rumours about Jamali's imminent ouster gathered force in the last three weeks, Musharraf retaliated against the PM's 'betrayal' through complete silence. Jamali was reduced to pathetically appealing to the media to desist from such speculation. The loss of face was decidedly his, but it also devalued Pakistani democracy.  Democracy here will continue to be undermined as long as no systemic measures are taken to balance the trinity of forces in Pakistan. As Senator Aitizaz Ahsan explains, 'Our constitutional history is the story of conflict between three elements - the civil and military bureaucracy, the judiciary and the fundamentalists. Only those politicians prepared to display abject subservience to this trinity can survive. Those who choose to challenge or even to question the trinity, there's death, imprisonment or exile.Unless the political and civil society address this distortion in our political-constitutional structure, there is little hope.'  Most have already given up hope. They fear once Aziz is anointed as PM, he'll call for a snap poll. Musharraf will help him engineer a two-third majority. The Constitution will be amended to usher in the presidential form of government. That's been the denouement to all democracy dramas army generals have scripted in Pakistan.

Yasuko Imatomi feels like she has heard this song before, and she's not singing along anymore. The 41-year-old Tokyo homemaker has been a longtime supporter of Japan's dominant Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and until fairly recently she counted herself as a fan of its silver-maned, silver-tongued leader, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. But here in the city's Shibuya neighborhood, as Koizumi and other party members begin campaigning for the July 11 Upper House election, Imatomi is a lot more cynical than she was three years ago when Koizumi first took office. As 'Jun-chan' and company promise, yet again, to enact broad structural reforms that will overhaul Japan's calcified political and social systems, Imatomi says Koizumi has been making the same pledges for years and has far too little to show for it. 'I'm having doubts about just how far he is willing to push his promises,' she says. 'I'm planning on voting for a different party this time.'   In the past few weeks, people like Imatomi have turned into a big, unforeseen headache for the Prime Minister. As little as a month ago, Koizumi was flying high and seemingly unassailable. In rapid succession this spring, he made a bold dash to North Korea to fetch family members of repatriated Japanese citizens abducted by the Hermit Kingdom in the 1970s; deftly sidestepped a pension scandal that had crippled the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the nation's primary opposition party, by taking down its two most senior members; and headed off to the G-8 summit on Sea Island in the U.S. state of Georgia, where he was lavishly fêted at a private breakfast with American President George W. Bush. His burst of statesmanlike coups led many pundits in the Japanese media to declare that this week's election was over before the campaigning had even begun. The polling, they opined, would be just another formality as Koizumi, alone atop the Japanese political landscape, would lead his LDP to a runaway victory and begin his final two years in office with a clear mandate to pursue his most important initiatives and secure his place in history.   But something happened on the way to the landslide. Once boasting an approval rating of 87%, Koizumi's power base has always been his overwhelming public mandate. But popular support has suddenly dissipated at a crucial juncture in his career. Due to two critical missteps, Koizumi's approval rating has fallen from 54% to 40% (one of his lowest scores ever) in the past five weeks. According to recent opinion polls, voters have taken a dim view of his surprising declaration at the G-8 summit that he had decided without consulting (or even informing) the Diet to keep Japanese troops in Iraq indefinitely. They are likewise annoyed by the way the LDP rammed through a pension-reform bill last month that raised citizens' premiums and lowered their payouts while doing little to solve the system's fundamental flaws. Many see the pension bill as an underhanded and secretive move reminiscent of Japan's behind-closed-doors political tradition, one not in keeping with Koizumi's new era of openness and transparency. And others have called the Iraq decision slavish toadying to American dictates that puts Japanese lives at unwarranted risk. 'These things have made people lose confidence in Koizumi fast,' says Takao Toshikawa, a veteran political commentator and the editor in chief of the newsletter Tokyo Insideline.   The election that was supposed to be a Koizumi walkover has thus become a hotly contested battle, one that has breathed signs of life into the DPJ, which most commentators had declared all but dead. Rather than a rubber stamp for a Koizumi mandate, July 11 has now become a key measure of public confidence (or lack thereof) in the Prime Minister's performance and an important indicator of how the final years of his term may play out. With 121 seats up for grabs, the LDP's declared goal is to capture at least 51. While outright control of the government is not at stake even if it falls well short of that objective (the LDP-led coalition still retains a handsome majority in the far larger and more powerful Lower House), a disappointing performance could embolden some of Koizumi's bitterest enemies from within the LDP to call for a change of leadership. There is a precedent for this, if not a tradition: after four out of five of the most recent Upper House elections, the Prime Minister has been forced out within 54 weeks. As campaigning heats up, most politicians and observers say the chances of a catastrophic LDP drubbing followed by Koizumi's ouster are remote. But there is no doubt now that the LDP's performance will set the tone for the duration of Koizumi's tenure.   Unfinished business: it's the cloud that continues to hang over Koizumi's government. While he is already one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers since 1945, there can be little doubt that a man who has repeatedly vowed to 'change Japan' - even if it requires destroying his own party - aspires to be remembered as a pivotal figure in Japanese history. And while Koizumi has made significant strides in areas such as banking reform and foreign affairs, if his administration were to end tomorrow, he would be remembered mostly for his charisma - and for a litany of promises unfulfilled. Will Koizumi go down in history as a leader who, like Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher, invigorated and modernized the government and, for better or worse, reoriented the attitudes and expectations of its citizens about the role the state plays in their lives? Koizumi has a daunting task ahead of him in the next two years if he is to secure that kind of stature. Most experts point to three primary areas - Japan's political structure, long overdue economic structural reforms, and the country's dysfunctional relationship with China - where he must devote his efforts if he is to be noted not just as one of the longest-serving Prime Ministers but as one of the best.    Executive Power  From the very beginning of his term in office, Koizumi has been Japan's most independent and 'presidential' Prime Minister. Conducting himself as if he were an opposition leader, he routinely rails against his own party, which has held a virtually unbroken monopoly on power for almost 50 years. Thanks to his overwhelming popularity, Koizumi has been able to work outside the LDP's famous, and famously arthritic, faction system, neutralizing it in significant ways. Early on, for example, he broke with tradition and rankled the Old Guard by picking Cabinet members he thought were most qualified for their jobs, rather than filling the posts by quota with members from each faction. Over the past three years, he has similarly built an administration that introduces far more legislation into the Diet than most Prime Ministers before him have. He routinely and unapologetically makes unilateral decisions, whether it's to open a dialogue with North Korea without consulting Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs or deciding to keep troops in Iraq without checking with anyone at all. In a country where a secretive ruling élite brokered deals behind closed doors, Koizumi has made the government more open and the executive branch more accountable. The citizenry may be upset that Japanese troops are still in Iraq, but no one doubts where the buck stops.  Unfortunately, it is unclear whether the government will revert to politics as usual as soon as Koizumi leaves office. Sheila Smith, a Japan specialist at Hawaii's East-West Center, gives Koizumi credit for introducing 'a whole new vocabulary for the LDP, one that includes responsiveness and transparency. The next person will not be able to retreat from that.' At the same time, Smith readily admits that the next PM might not be up to the job. 'There aren't many Koizumis out there,' she says.   Curiously, this is a situation that Koizumi seems uninterested in remedying. Not only is there no leader with Koizumi's panache waiting in the wings, but virtually every political expert in Japan agrees that Koizumi has made no attempt to groom a generation of young politicians capable of carrying on his good works. 'Koizumi may have cut through LDP factional politics,' says former LDP lawmaker Raizo Matsuno, 'but he's not interested in creating a successor.' Take 49-year-old LDP secretary-general Shinzo Abe, Koizumi's heir apparent. Abe is a young, good-looking, impeccably credentialed reformer handpicked by Koizumi to be the party's No. 2 man. He appears on many of the LDP's election posters and has been delegated to take the lead on certain issues, such as the North Korea abductees. But those who know both men say he is far from Koizumi's tight-knit inner circle and could hardly be called a protégé. Many commentators, such as newsletter editor Toshikawa, say that Koizumi brought Abe into the fold not so much to nurture him as to keep him on a short leash. While Abe will doubtless be a powerful force in Japanese politics in the future, it is unclear whether his style will approach anything that could be called Koizumiesque. And though Koizumi has put the LDP faction machine in idle, its engine continues to hum.    Economy  One of the apparently unqualified successes of Koizumi's time in office has been Japan's surprisingly robust economic rebound. After fading in and out of recession for more than a decade, the country has posted two consecutive quarters of annualized GDP growth in excess of 6% (making it the world's fastest-growing mature economy), and results for the quarter ended June 30 are expected to be equally impressive. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock-market index, meanwhile, has surged 56% since its 20-year lows reached last April, corporate profits and confidence are stronger than they have been in a decade, and household spending, consumer confidence and employee bonuses are all on the rise.   Koizumi has garnered the most praise for filling high economic and policymaking posts with effective leaders. Financial Services Minister Heizo Takenaka, for example, has forced ailing Japanese banks—once seen as the single greatest threat to the nation's financial stability—to radically overhaul their balance sheets. Thanks to Takenaka's get-tough measures, nonperforming loans at major Japanese banks have fallen from 8% in 2001 to 5.2% at the end of March 2004; debt-rating agency Standard & Poor's has just lifted its assessment of several Japanese banks for the first time in 21 years. Meanwhile, Toshihiko Fukui, who was appointed Bank of Japan governor in March 2003, has been much more successful than his predecessor in stifling Japan's pernicious, decade-long bout of deflation through unconventionally loose monetary policies.   Even with such savvy appointments, many critics maintain that Koizumi has still mostly been lucky - that the economy has been buoyed primarily by forces beyond his control. While Koizumi has not attempted to kick-start growth via wasteful public-spending projects the way many of his predecessors did, much of Japan's economic revival is the result of self-initiated restructuring by many of the country's world-class multinational businesses. (Meanwhile, Japan's highly inefficient domestic industries, such as mom-and-pop retailing and food production, bumble along as unprofitably as ever.) And the voracious appetite of Chinese industries for basic materials, not to mention that country's growing consumer demand, has proved to be a surprising and welcome salvation to a broad swath of Japanese manufacturers and exporters that only recently had been sounding the alarms about China's ability to 'export deflation' or 'hollow out Japanese industry' by taking over factory jobs once handled by domestic workers.   Regardless of the immediate causes of Japan's recovery, questions remain about its sustainability. Koizumi came to power as an economic reformer. Yet his three pet reform initiatives - privatizing the postal system, reforming the quasi-governmental highway-development companies, and overhauling the pension system - have barely left the drawing board since he made some of them central campaign planks as far back as 2001. In interviews with the Japanese press last month, Koizumi said that privatizing the postal system - an oddball governmental institution that not only delivers mail but also acts as the country's largest savings bank and as an insurance company - was his highest priority. An increasingly skeptical populace has been hearing that same promise for more than three years, and few believe he has enough political capital left to force unwilling LDP members to make the radical legislative changes necessary. Editor Toshikawa says, 'He simply doesn't have the clout to carry out these privatization schemes. And if the LDP doesn't get 51 seats [in the Upper House election], he might abandon postal reform altogether.'   Even those who are sanguine about Japan's recent economic performance warn that as long as structural reforms and a pension overhaul remain uncompleted, the country's fundamentals will continue to decay. The soaring stock market, they say, has papered over lingering inefficiencies at many companies, giving a much-needed (though potentially short-lived) boost to their asset levels. Similarly, Japan faces the worst demographic time bomb in the industrialized world - a problem that Koizumi and the LDP's pension reforms have done little to address. Many say Koizumi has lost any taste he may have had for the battles necessary to effect change. 'The whole pension system needs to be taken apart and rebuilt,' says Kazuhiko Nishizawa, an analyst at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, 'but the administration isn't thinking that far ahead.'    China  While Koizumi came to power as a domestic reformer, his greatest successes have so far been in foreign affairs. He boldly dispatched troops to Iraq (the first shipment of Japanese troops to a foreign land without the United Nations' blessing since World War II), and has maneuvered to be a major participant in the multinational engagement with North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. For all his aplomb on the geopolitical scene, however, Koizumi has allowed Japan's crucial relationship with China to languish. 'While pursuing closer ties with the U.S. and attempting to normalize relations with North Korea, Koizumi has abandoned China,' says Jun Iio, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. Since taking office, Koizumi has lived up to his promise to visit Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's military war dead, at least once a year - meaning the Prime Minister, regularly like clockwork, offends China, whose citizens were brutalized by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Beijing has declared that Koizumi is unwelcome as long as the visits continue. So while trade between China and Japan has been booming, diplomatic relations are stalled.   Fixing that may mean making compromises about Yasukuni Shrine and more fully addressing other aspects of Japan's past war conduct, such as the Nanjing Massacre. Any admission of wrongdoing would be very unpopular with many of Koizumi's most conservative supporters, but political experts maintain that such compromises are the only way to get more fruitful dialogues with China rolling. 'China is strengthening its presence throughout East Asia, but Japan and China have so many unresolved, complicated issues,' says Terumasa Nakanishi, professor of international politics at Kyoto University.   From the day he burst onto the political scene, Koizumi was the outsider in his own party, relying on charm and public support to push his often-maverick agenda. But as his popularity rating now hovers near an all-time low, his antagonistic relationship with many of his colleagues may have boxed him in on everything from structural reforms to international relations. While Koizumi's tenure has already been an unqualified, if modest, success on a number of fronts, he has an exceedingly tough climb ahead of him if he is to achieve all of his goals before leaving office. According to Glen Fukushima, ex-president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, what was once a river of goodwill that allowed Koizumi to float, almost miraculously, above the politics-as-usual fray, has begun to evaporate. That has created a vicious circle that threatens to snuff out his attempts to salvage a lasting political legacy. 'His failure to implement what he has said he would do,' Fukushima says, 'has led to a decline in his popularity - which makes it difficult for him to do what he needs to.' Back in 2001, as Japan's Prime Minister came to power on a wave of confidence and public optimism, he declared himself 'Junichiro Koizumi, the lionhearted.' As he heads into a tight election and perhaps his toughest season of policy battles, Koizumi has an opportunity to prove whether he deserves that nickname not just because of his leonine mane, but because of the power of his convictions and the tenacity of his fight.

"              HIGHLIGHTS   RETAIL – PRICE STRATEGIES   Asda to cut petrol prices again    Supermarket chain Asda has unveiled a fresh round of petrol price reductions - cutting the cost of a litre by 1p.  Asda said that from Wednesday the price of unleaded petrol and diesel at its UK forecourts would be 78.9p a litre.  Britain's second biggest grocer cut petrol prices by 2p a litre last Thursday, prompting a wave of similar reductions by rivals.  Asda said its decision had been made possible by the falling cost of oil on the world market.  Petrol pledge Paul Mancey, Asda's trading director, said: 'We all had to pay higher prices when costs went up and we should all be paying less now. Our customers, quite rightly, expect nothing less.'  The company operates 150 petrol stations across the UK.  Responding to Asda's announcement, supermarket rival Sainsbury's said it would also be looking to cut prices.  A spokeswoman for the firm said: 'In line with our policy of selling the cheapest petrol where we trade, we will be undercutting Asda again.'

Its marketing is slick and Coke is the best-selling soft drink in the world.  Few would have predicted that Coke's attempt to launch its Dasani bottled water brand in the UK would prove to be a disaster for such an experienced company.   Yet, in March this year, only five weeks after its multi million pound UK launch, red-faced Coke executives were forced to take Dasani off the shelves in the UK.  What went wrong?  Dasani was launched in the USA in 1999 as a bottled, purified water, and had become a huge success there. Taking that same formula and repeating it for the UK market must have looked like a breeze, but that wasn't quite how it turned out.  Unlike most of the bottled water sold in British petrol stations and supermarkets Dasani hadn't come from alpine glaciers or trickled out of a precious natural spring - it had come out of the local tap. True, the company put it through a purification process and added mineral salts, but the source was still tap water.  At its launch on 10 February, some people in the drinks industry already knew Dasani's big 'secret'. Simon Mowbray of The Grocer magazine had mentioned the source of the water in an article, but didn't think anyone else would pick up on it. Now, he sees it more graphically. 'It was a bomb waiting to go off,' he says.    The Real Sting   At first, the launch seemed to have go well, and Coke executives thought the public would respond to their new product with its distinctive blue packaging. But everything changed when the Press Association reporter Graham Hiscott saw the reference in the Grocer magazine to the real source of Dasani.  The following day, the story was splashed across the daily papers. Headlines like 'The Real Sting' a play on Coke's 'The Real Thing' slogan and the more obvious 'Coke sells tap water for 95p' could hardly have been worse for Coke and their new baby.  The tabloids drew on the uncanny parallel with the episode in the BBC sitcom 'Only Fools and Horses', in which Del Boy and Rodney take ordinary tap water from their Peckham flat and bottle it up to sell as Peckham Spring. The irony couldn't have been worse. Dasani was sourced and bottled in a factory in Sidcup, just a few miles down the road from Peckham! The tabloids continued their onslaught. 'Are they taking us for plonkers!' yelled the Daily Star.    Contaminated   Despite the pages of negative press coverage, Coke persisted with Dasani. Executives protested that they had been misunderstood and that the drink was not just tap water but in fact the result of a highly sophisticated process to create the purest drinking water you can get. As far as Coke were concerned, Dasani was a lifestyle drink, a drink you would want to be seen with, the source was all but irrelevant.  Then on Thursday 18 March there was even worse news.  Something had gone wrong at the Dasani factory and a bad batch of minerals had contaminated the water production with a potentially carcinogenic bromate. Coke admitted defeat. Immediately they withdrew all 500,000 bottles of Dasani in circulation. In just five weeks, Dasani had come and gone, arguably providing more in terms of entertainment than refreshment.  The cost to Coke is thought to run into the millions, but behind the financial loss is the possibility of an even more serious problem. After years of heady growth, sales of Coca-Cola are beginning to flatten out. Bottled water, by contrast, is now the fastest-growing of the soft drinks and Coke still need a successful bottled water for the UK and the European market.  An organisation the size of Coke, with the marketing strength that has made it the biggest drinks company in the world, is unlikely to give up easily. Astonishingly, Dasani could make a comeback one day. Asked whether the company has any plans to bring Dasani back, Patricia McNamara, New Beverages Director at coca cola GB says coyly, 'we like to think it's a definite maybe'.

One market source said Woolworths was 'hurting' because of the slow rollout of its petrol offer and that sales were 'soft' because of competition from the fully realised Coles-Shell petrol alliance. The speculation follows a 4.9% rise in third-quarter supermarket sales.   After that result in April, chief executive Roger Corbett said improvements would come in the fourth quarter when the Caltex petrol agreement was finalised. The final agreement was signed two weeks later and the more than 90 Caltex sites were expected to be converted 'immediately'. At the time, Caltex had converted 41 of more than 130 sites slated for the alliance. A spokesman declined to comment on the sales figures. But he said that since the agreement was finalised, Woolworths had co-branded about 40 of its 310 Petrol Plus sites to Caltex, and was aiming to convert between 10 and 12 Petrol Plus sites a week.

The world has no comparable period of failure anywhere else in at least the last century, including the Great Depression. From 1960 to 1979, these economies grew at a decent rate, chalking up an 80% gain in income per person. In spite of Latin America having the world's worst inequality in income distribution, this was enough to substantially improve living standards for the vast majority of the population, including most of the poor.  But then something went wrong, and it has as much to do with policies advocated by the 'Washington consensus.' From 1980 to 1999, per-capita income grew by only 11%. The 1980s were known as Latin America's 'lost decade,' when the region's income per person actually fell. The 1990s produced only modest growth, and the first decade of the 21st century is now looking like it might also count itself among the missing. Using the International Monetary Fund's [IMF] projections for 2004, the first half of the new decade [2000-04] shows a gain of about 1% for the whole five years.    Mexico’s malaise;  Amazing, isn't it? One would think that after 25 years of reforms - opening up to international trade and investment, privatization of state-owned enterprises, enforcing budget and monetary discipline, and other measures that have caused quite a bit of pain and dislocation to the region's citizens - these countries would have something to show for it.  The fact that this problem has received so little attention is even more astounding. Remember, 2004 is also NAFTA's 10th anniversary. And while a number of press reports have hailed the huge increase in trade and foreign direct investment that Mexico has experienced over the last decade, few mentioned how low the growth rate has been.  This is comparable to evaluating a professional baseball player without including his batting average. He may be a great fielder and a good team player, but if he bats .125, can he make it in the major leagues? That's a fair analogy to Mexico's economic performance during the NAFTA decade: less then 1% annual growth in gross domestic product [GDP] per person - not even a quarter of what was achieved in the decades prior to 1980.    Economic growth  - not tariff reduction or a balanced budget - is what determines whether people have a higher standard of living than that of their parents or grandparents. And when the economy grows, it's at least possible to direct a larger share of the new income and wealth to people who are less well off. When the economy doesn't grow, it means that any gains at the bottom must come at the expense of someone else.    Lackluster at best;  When pressed, defenders of the 'Washington consensus' reforms say we really shouldn't count the 1980s, since there was a lot of hangover from over-borrowing during the 1970s. They also say the growth in prior decades was unsustainable. But Latin America had decent growth for 30 years, going back to the 1950s, so the idea that it isn't sustainable is hard to fathom. South Korea maintained a per-capita growth rate averaging more than 6% annually - much higher than Latin America at its best - for four decades. And whatever Latin policy mistakes were made in the 1970s, it's a bit of a reach to keep blaming them for economic failure into the 21st century.  And it's fair to use 1980 as a dividing line for looking at Latin America's economic performance, because 1979 was a business-cycle peak for the U.S., which is the destination for about two-thirds of Latin America's exports. But even if we restrict our focus to the 1990s, the region's growth performance was lackluster: just 14% for the decade. If this is the best that can be done while the U.S. is enjoying its longest-running economic expansion in history, something is very wrong.  It's not hard to see what that might be. Look at Brazil, which once had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. From 1960-79, its per-capita income grew by 160%. If that growth had continued, the country would today have living standards approaching those of Western Europe. But it has grown at about one-eighth that rate since 1980. And in 2003, the Brazilian economy shrank.    Wrong prescription;  Yet Brazil's central bank is currently keeping short-term interest rates at 16%. With inflation running at about 6%, this means a real interest rate of more than 10%. That's terribly high for an economy struggling to come out of a recession. For comparison, the U.S. Federal Reserve has kept short-term rates at 1% more than two years into an economic recovery. Imagine if it had chosen 11% or 12% instead. There wouldn't have been much of a market for home mortgages or much chance of an economic recovery.  Brazil has also upped its primary budget surplus to 4.25% of GDP. Again, this is the opposite of what the U.S. does in response to a slow economy. America went from a budget surplus of 2% of GDP to a deficit of more than 4% - a stimulus of more than $6 trillion dollars - since the economy slowed down in 2001.   These kinds of procyclical economic policies are often promoted by the IMF, which is dominated by the Treasury Dept., and its partner, the World Bank. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz likes to joke that the IMF made a mathematical 'sign error' on the blackboard back in the 1950s - writing a minus instead of a plus - and hasn't corrected it yet.  More independence and departures from the 'Washington consensus' will be needed if Latin America is to resume a normal growth path. And they probably will be forthcoming. But it would help if more policymakers north of the Rio Grande were at least willing to recognize that they may not know what's best for their Southern neighbors.

Yet pricing remains misunderstood and poorly managed, according to The Price Advantage, a new book by three consultants at McKinsey & Company. Even executives at highly successful companies may not fully appreciate how small changes in price can lead to large changes in profitability.    Several software programs have been developed in recent years to help companies strengthen their pricing capabilities. But the authors – Michael V. Marn, Eric V. Roegner and Craig C. Zawada – argue that companies can truly achieve the price advantage only by making deep and lasting changes in their organizations. Such a major shift takes time, they say, but the effort can pay big dividends. Wharton marketing professor David J. Reibstein recently spoke to Marn, a partner in McKinsey’s Cleveland office, about the major themes that he and his co-authors discuss in the book. Over the years, Marn has developed some of the most widely used analytics for identifying pricing opportunities.    Reibstein:  Mike, a good place for us to start is with you defining what you mean by the price advantage.    Marn:  When we talk about the price advantage what we mean is not that a company has a product with a low price relative to competition.  We’ve got a much more holistic definition.  We think of price advantage as a superior capability to use price as a source of real competitive advantage that at the end of the day makes your company more successful. You’ll often hear companies talk about their other advantages. They’ll talk about a purchasing advantage or a cost advantage or an innovation advantage or a distribution advantage or a service advantage.  You never hear them talking about having a price advantage - that they price better than their competitors do.   What we’ve observed over the years, and one reason we wrote the book, is that we had so many clients that worked so very hard to create advantages in other areas only to give them away because they didn’t have the price advantage, because they didn’t know how to price to make sure that the advantages they created really delivered benefit.  Why bother to work so very hard to cut your costs if you’re just going to pass it on to your customers without taking anything for yourself? Why bother to work as hard to innovate if you’re just going to charge the same price for the old product that you’re replacing? Why bother working so hard to be a high-service provider if you’re going to match the price of a low-service provider in the marketplace? In a lot of ways, the price advantage is more than just an advantage unto itself. It’s an advantage that enables companies to realize the benefits of the other advantages they work so hard to create.    Reibstein:  My understanding of a cost advantage is that I have lower costs. My understanding of a distribution advantage is that I have easier access to distribution. But you’re not talking about a higher price or being able to command a higher price or charge a lower price than the competition.    Marn:  No. We're talking about having the capability to come up with the right price more consistently. I would insist that the mistake most companies make, if you look at it over time, is they typically price too low. They have real benefits for which they don’t charge appropriately. The error bias is much more toward companies under-pricing. But at the same time, having the price advantage would let you know when you are indeed pricing too high and appropriately adjusting downward when that makes sense. It’s not about always being too high or too low. It’s about understanding the power of having the right price for as many transactions in the market as you can.    Reibstein: You make a strong point in the book about how you can leverage a small price change into big profit changes, and I think you articulate that pretty well. I’m curious how you see the tradeoff between price and market share, where the price advantage happens to lead to more of a short-term profit advantage versus going for market share, which might gain you a longer-term advantage in terms of distribution or, ultimately, lower costs.    Marn:  That’s a good question. I think you have to read The Price Advantage in the context of overall strategy. In other words, what we’re talking about in most cases is, against the backdrop of the strategic decisions you make, how can you manage pricing? If indeed a management team says, ‘We need to have 35% market share or more in this particular market to survive, to support our infrastructure, to run our plants at adequate capacity,’ then we would suggest that even if you pursue that 35% market share, there are things you can do to maximize your price that will likely improve your profitability.    Reibstein:  Is the issue of price critical across all industries? Let me tell you why I’m asking that question. I was looking at the numbers that you threw out for where a company gets leverage on price and it’s more the case for companies that have very high variable costs. I was wondering about industries where the variable costs are quite low, such as the airline industry or software. I was wondering how critical you think the pricing component is in those contexts?         Marn:  I would make the case that the pricing lever is crucially important in all situations. What you often see happening in high fixed-cost, low variable-cost businesses is that, despite the fact that gross margins are very high, it’s not uncommon for actual operating profits, or earnings before interest and taxes, to be relatively thin. So the leverage of improving pricing is just as high on the bottom line. The way it trades off versus volume might be a bit different. But, that said, the upside of improving pricing is still equally powerful. Quite frankly, I think the one time I would take care about backing away from a strategy driven by understanding very carefully the tradeoff between price and volume and margin, would be a situation where you think your market is growing very, very quickly -- in other words, situations where early penetration into a market or development of markets is crucially important. But any market that has grown to maturity where growth rates aren’t wild and where competitors have settled in – the payoff of doing this well, whether you have a heavy fixed cost or heavy variable cost structure, is extremely high.    Reibstein:  What readership do you envision for the book?    Marn:  We wrote this book for individuals in businesses who have a role in pricing. We believe there’s a role for the general manager, the CEO. There’s a role for the VP of marketing. There’s a role for the product manager. There’s a role for the sales manager. There’s a role for the salespeople. We wrote this book for the whole range of individuals up and down the hierarchy of most organizations who play a role in pricing decision-making.    Reibstein:  What was your motivation for writing the book?    Marn:  At McKinsey we’ve been doing pricing work as a major part of our marketing efforts for the better part of 20 years. It’s one of the largest single function areas of marketing in which we help clients. The thing that’s amazing is, you would think that after 20 years there would be a bit of a collective awareness of the pricing opportunity and of the basic frameworks and tools to create price advantage in organizations. It continued to amaze us that we would go into some business units of very good companies, Fortune 1000 companies, companies all around the world, and start talking about pricing as if we just turned on the light bulb for the first time. Our thought was by writing this book we could give managers a practical way of understanding and capturing this still-elusive opportunity for so many companies. Twenty years ago, I would have thought, golly, there wouldn’t be a need for a book like this because everyone had signed on to the powerful ideas around pricing. But we’re sitting here in 2004 with 50% of companies not being good at this. It’s one of the biggest surprises of my professional life.    Reibstein:  Actually, I share in that amazement and, frankly, some disappointment that industry is not moving along a lot faster.    Marn:  When you find a company that is really good at pricing, it goes beyond doing the Excel spreadsheets. Courage is required to really nail this. A lot of companies don’t do a very good job of creating the institutional courage to price right. It’s easier not to price well. It’s easier to cave in when customers ask for low prices, or competitors lob a low price into a situation. It takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to do it well. I’m wondering out loud if that behavior has prevented this from catching on like other more cut-and-dried management function improvement processes over the years.    Reibstein:  Are there some industries where you think achieving price advantage is more developed than others?    Marn:  I cannot point to one industry and say 80% do this well. It comes down more to individual players in a variety of industries.    Reibstein:  I’ve been surprised to see how well the chemical industry does it.    Marn:  I think a few chemical companies have really stepped up their game in pricing in the last five years or so. But I cannot point to a single industry where the top five players all do pricing well. Typically, you find zero or one in an industry that do it really, really well. Or maybe two. And that, to me, is what’s so exciting about pursuit of the price advantage.  It’s not something everyone has already. It is still an advantage that can really cause you to stand out in terms of your performance. This is not about playing catch-up. This is about getting out ahead and investing in creating an advantage that most others in your industry probably don’t have already.   Even industries that invest tens of millions of dollars in pricing processes and systems don’t do it all that well. Look at the airlines. For all the sophistication they have in how they price, the performance of airlines today is not that great. You wouldn’t put a big part of your investment portfolio into airlines. In the specialty chemical industry a couple of players do it really well.  In consumer packaged goods there are a couple that do it well and a bunch that don’t. You look at service industry and there are a minority that do it well and most don’t. You go right down the list and there’s no one industry you can point to and say across the board this is one industry that’s got it really nailed.    Reibstein:   I want to pick up on something you said earlier - that there’s always a temptation to cave in. Where do prices really end up being set in a company? You talk in the book about how pricing departments have sprung up in companies in the last 10 years. But it’s one thing to have the price set at corporate and another thing when you get down to the front line where the salesperson is talking to the customer. First of all, how much of whatever ends up happening concerning pricing really happens on the front line rather than at corporate? And, second, how much leeway should you give the sales force in determining prices?    Marn:  That’s a very rich question, and it’s one that I think is misunderstood by a lot of companies. I have seen companies price exceedingly well with very centralized pricing processes and very decentralized pricing processes. By centralized, I mean all price decisions are made at headquarters. By decentralized, I mean there is considerable discretionary authority to discount price out in the field. Now, I think the mistake a lot of companies make is they say, ‘You know, my sales people have no price discretion. Any price discount that they want to grant customers, they need to get approval from the “pricing desk.’” One would think with that control, or lack of field discretion, that they would have the pricing process under control and that nothing bad is going to happen. But that’s exactly the wrong point of view.   No matter whether your pricing authority is centralized or decentralized, something very crucial happens at the salesperson/customer interface.  Even without pricing authority, what you’ll find is the best salespeople, the ones who really understand customers well and know how to sell value, will actually end up charging higher prices. And their customers end up, even if the pricing is centralized, going back to the central pricing desk with fewer price-discount requests. So I would suggest that whether the salesperson has field pricing authority at a high or low level, it doesn’t matter. He or she is always going to be a crucial cog in the creation of a price advantage in an organization.  That would be point number one.  Point number two builds on the idea that companies can be successful at very centralized and very decentralized pricing. The connection to make is this: The more decentralized your pricing process - that is, the more pricing authority you push out to the field, be it to regional managers, district managers or salespeople - the higher level of pricing skill you need to build in those people. You also need a higher level of monitoring of their performance. And you need a higher level of incentives tied to pricing in their compensation plans. A lot of companies push pricing authority out to the field, but they’ll fail to create those three conditions for success.    Reibstein:  I think that’s an excellent point. I’m particularly intrigued by your observations on technology’s role in pricing. Do you want to talk a little bit about what you see as the role of technology today and where you see it going?    Marn:  What you’re seeing now is a number of software companies filling that gap that existed maybe 10 years ago or so when companies were trying to get their pricing processes supported by systems. It turns out that a fair number of viable software alternatives out there today support the pricing process. We have felt for years that investing in this kind of software for most companies usually does make great sense.    Reibstein:  Which software systems are you thinking about?    Marn:  Some 30 or so are decent. But if I mention one, I risk endorsing it. There are several that are very good alternatives.  The point is that the payoff for doing even a little better in pricing, even a half a percentage point or a percentage point, is so high that it makes sense to have systems that let you deal with the issue at that level of precision. By the way, we’re not taking about rocket-science software. It’s simple software that makes very visible to salespeople and sales managers and market managers and product managers just what the real economics of a customer and a transaction are.    Reibstein:  Rather than mention any companies, can you talk about the class of software you’re referring to?    Marn:  There’s a class of software called administrative software that helps you figure out what the so-called price waterfall looks like for a customer or a transaction.  So when it’s time for you to make a decision when a customer is negotiating with you on next year’s contract, you can at the press of a button see where my discounts are but not the waterfall. What’s the bottom line, pocket price, and pocket margin? Was that realized for that account during the last year? What changed? Are they taking more cash discounts? Are they taking longer to pay? A system that adds it up together for you properly on a real-time basis can be hugely beneficial at times when you’re negotiating with customers.   [ Editor’s Note:  Many companies use an incomplete metric for transaction pricing, such as the list price or invoice price.  Pocket priceis simply invoice price minus all the off-invoice discounts that occur after invoice price, including items like cash discounts, volume bonuses, freight allowances, promotional allowances and cooperative advertising. Pocket price represents the real dollars and cents that are left in a business’ pocket as the result of a transaction.  A business does put list price or invoice price in its pocket, but it puts pocket price in its pocket to cover costs and ultimately contribute to margin and profitability.  The pocket price waterfall is simply the graphical representation of pocket price. The format is a set of vertical bars, the left-most one being list price and the following bars being the discounts subtracted from list price to get down to invoice price.  From the invoice price bar, all of the off-invoice items mentioned earlier are subtracted to get down to pocket price.  The picture ends up looking like a waterfall with dollars and cents 'leaking away' with every bar down to pocket price.  When a product is custom-made to individual customers -- for example, not a standard packaged product for each consumer -- or if there exist important cost-to-serve items that vary widely by customer or transaction, then pocket price itself can be an inadequate representation of the attractiveness of a transaction.  In such situations, Marn and his co-authors often suggest the extension of pocket price down to pocket margin.  Hence, pocket margin is pocket price minus standard costs and minus any special costs-to-serve that a company might incur.  The pocket margin metrics allows the comparison of transactions where the product is not standard or the cost-to-serve is highly variable.  The pocket margin waterfall is the graphical representation of pocket margin.]   The second class is what I call optimizing software, which tries to provide some intelligence on how to price. This software looks up past transactions and tries to judge at what price level you’ll get an optimal price/benefit tradeoff for a certain category of products.   There’s a third category of price-testing software that I find very exciting. These products let companies that either sell online or sell through call centers on a real-time basis test price levels. If you are a computer company selling personal computers online, for every 20th PC that you sell in a certain class you might bump the price up 3% or bump it down 5% when you quote it. If you do this on a regular basis, if you have enough of a high-volume transaction stream, you can get a sense, with this real-time testing, how sensitivity to price is changing over time.    Reibstein:  I’m a big believer in that.    Marn:  That’s some of the most exciting software that’s come out in recent years, and I think companies are just beginning now to reap the benefit of that real-time understanding. The idea is that you always have a price test going on. You always have your thumb on the pulse of how price sensitivity is changing for products all the time.    Reibstein:  Mike, is there something I haven’t asked you yet that you’d like to mention?    Marn:  I’d like to say that all too many well-intentioned companies approach price improvement as a project, as something you can knock off in six months or a year and then go on to the next thing you need to fix. When you look at companies that have really created the price advantage, it’s not that way at all. This is at least a medium- to long-term journey. To get it right in most companies, you have to potentially touch hundreds, even thousands, of people. You have to change their day-to-day behavior, change the tools they use, change the way they think about price versus volume versus market share. It’s more work than you think. It’s a larger investment than you think. But the good news is that it’s worth it.   We’ve seen clients that have stuck with this over the years and they keep accumulating benefits over time, in terms of stretching out their margins on a year-over-year basis. But there’s almost a change in the feel of the culture of the company. If you go into a company that has created the price advantage, you see a couple of things. You see people who really are customer focused. They understand that they can’t create the price advantage unless they create value for their customers. And, you see workers at all levels who understand, ‘If I work hard to create an advantage for my customer or an advantage for my company, I know we’re going to get a payoff for it. My hard work at a company where the price advantage exists always has a payoff. It’s not going to be given away to the market. It’s not going to be frittered away in a temporary volume increase.’ There’s a certain spirit in companies that achieve the price advantage. It’s a long-term cultural change.

While other Washington-area jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on 'big box' stores, legislation sponsored by Montgomery County Executive Douglas M. Duncan is aimed more narrowly at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The measure would impose tough new zoning restrictions on stores that are larger than 120,000 square feet and devote at least 10 percent of their floor space to groceries. It would exempt stores that do not sell food, such as most Target stores and Home Depot, and it would exempt club membership stores such as Costco.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has one standard-size store in Montgomery County, in Germantown, and no plans to expand in the county, said Mia Masten, Wal-Mart's community affairs manager for the eastern region.  Still, Wal-Mart opposes the measure. 'We think it's anti-competitive and anti-consumer,' said Masten. 'It not only affects us, but other competitors who want to come into Montgomery County and offer consumers one-stop shopping, which is what consumers say they want.'  The alliance against Wal-Mart reflects the shared interests of supermarkets and Commercial Workers Local 400, which recently reached a four-year labor contract after weeks of preparations for a strike.  Across the country, the nonunion discount stores have been a serious competitive threat to established supermarkets and their unionized work forces.  During the contract talks between the chains and the union, supermarket executives noted increasing competition from Wal-Mart and other nonunion retailers as the impetus for proposed benefit cuts.  'We have spoken to coordinate lobbying the bill,' said Barry F. Scher, Giant vice president of public affairs.  'We are supportive of the concept,' said Safeway spokesman Greg TenEyck, although he said his chain has not taken an active role in lobbying for the measure.  A Local 400 official confirmed that the union is working with Giant to push the bill. 'We are communicating about it,' the official said.  The pre-emptive move in Montgomery County did not surprise industry experts.  'A grocery store cannot compete against a supercenter,' said Jason Whitmer, an analyst at FTN Midwest Research Securities. 'The logic is to fight Wal-Mart before they come, rather than when they come.'  FTN Midwest found that within a year of opening, a Wal-Mart supercenter takes 11 percent of grocery store business within three miles.  It's not clear whether the proposed ordinance will win approval from the Montgomery County Council. Uncertainty remains about whether singling out combination retail stores - those that sell food and general merchandise - would survive a court challenge.  'I don't think we've been provided with enough information to draw a circle around something called a combination retail store and have it pass legal muster,' said council President Steven A. Silverman.

Its stock is still paying the price for that widely publicized miscalculation. Now, the Anglo-Dutch outfit that manufactures Slim-Fast diet products has got the low-carb religion, replacing the head of that division and preparing to roll out a slew of low-carb products.   Meantime, while Unilever's performance continues to lag, peers like France's Danone and Switzerland's Nestlé have seen revenues and stocks rise nicely this year. Unilever squeezed only a 1.3% revenue gain from its leading brands - a key sales measurement - in the first quarter of 2004 amid a variety of challenges, including increasing competition.   Analysts had forecast at least a 2% boost, and the figure was a far cry from Unilever's 3% to 5% long-term growth target for leading brands such as Knorr soups and Surf detergent. Its stable of leading brands, which make up nearly 95% of sales, rose 2.5% in 2003.    Star-studded cupboard.  When the latest results were announced on Apr. 28, Unilever's American depositary receipts (ADRs), which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped more than 7%. (Each Unilever ADR represents one share of Rotterdam-based parent Unilever NV. Although Unilever operates as a single company, a separate London-based parent company, Unilever PLC, trades on the London stock exchange.)   Since then, the shares have recovered some. Trading around $66 as of June 14, the stock is up about 3% so far this year, vs. a 2% gain for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, of which Unilever ADRs are not a component.   Unilever shares have been resilient because many of its brands, including Vaseline and Ben & Jerry's, to tick off a few more, are recognized around the world. Unilever is also highly profitable, boasting some of the fattest margins vs. its European rivals. First-quarter operating margins were a rich 14.9% before exceptional items and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets (BEIA).    Faltering strategy?  In fiscal 2004, Unilever is expected to have 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in net income (BEIA), 3% higher than in 2003, on revenue of 42.3 billion euros ($51.2 billion), according to Michael Steib, executive director with Morgan Stanley in London. Steib's revenue forecast is about 1.4% lower than last year's number, mainly because of currency translations.   'They have strong brands, and they have strong value,' Steib says. 'Bottom-line growth and margin improvement have been impressive.' Still, Steib remains neutral on Unilver, rating it equal weight. And his 58 euro price target for shares trading on the Amsterdam exchange suggests only 5% or so price appreciation in the next 12 months. 'They need to demonstrate through innovation and change in brands that they intend to have a pickup in top-line growth.'   Unilever management has its work cut out, analysts and company watchers say. 'Growth strategy appears to have sort of faltered,' says Lex Werkheim, a partner at Eureffect, an Amsterdam asset-management firm which owns Unilever shares.    Slim-fast’s slow switch.  Unilever says it's nearing the end of a five-year 'Path to Growth' launched in 1999. It's on track to trim brands to the most profitable 400 from a once dizzying 1,600 worldwide, it says. It also has cut more than the expected 3.9 billion euros ($4.7 billion) from manufacturing and other operations as part of the growth initiative.   And Unilever PLC has had a change at the top. Chairman Niall FitzGerald, 58, is leaving to become chairman of British news and information company Reuters. In keeping with tradition, Unilever PLC has picked an insider to fill the spot. Patrick Cescau, a 55-year-old director of the firm's global foods division, takes the helm later this year.   But analysts want to see more progress before becoming more upbeat about the stock. First, Unilever needs to do a better job of managing its brands, analysts say, especially Slim-Fast. 'In early June of last year, Unilever was still saying low-carb diets were a fad that was going to go away,' says London-based J.P. Morgan analysts Arnaud Langlois, who has an underweight rating on the stock and believes the price could actually decline. Slim-Fast products traditionally have included foods such as shakes and meal bars that serve as low-calorie - but not necessarily low-carbohydrate - alternatives to regular food.    On the scent.  Someone finally got the message. At the end of last year, Unilever rolled out five low-carb Slim-Fast products. And in its Apr. 28 earnings release, the big news was that the low-carb newcomers are already accounting for about 20% of Slim-Fast revenues.   But it also said in the same note that Slim-Fast's low-carb debut 'has not yet compensated for the decline in share of the traditional products.' Seventeen more low-carb products are going to be launched, the company said. And on June 4, Unilever said the president of the Slim-Fast unit would be leaving, to be replaced by a food-division exec.   Slim-Fast isn't Unilever's only struggling brand. There's also the Prestige fragrance division, which sells Calvin Klein Obsession, Eternity, cK, and other designer names. 'Other companies have been quicker to launch more products,' Steib says. 'With fragrances, consumers are on to new things very quickly.' Those twin problems with Slim-Fast and fragrances have hit Unilever particularly hard in North America, which represented 23% of revenues in 2003, and where first-quarter sales fell 4%.   In an e-mail response to BusinessWeek Online, company spokesman Trevor Gorin said consumers have not had any 'significant change in taste' when it comes to Unilever fragrances. Rather, marketing the scents became tougher, as consumers became more selective in their discretionary spending. The division, Gorin says, is under new leadership and expects to see the benefits from a restructuring plan in the second half of 2004. As for Slim-Fast, Gorin says Unilever forecasts 'a return to modest growth as we rebuild consumer loyalty' in 2004.    New focus.  Unilever also has more work to do in getting rid of underperforming brands, analysts say. As the prime target, most investing pros singled out the frozen-food business in Europe. Increased competition from discounters and others is making pricing tough there, analysts say.   Unilever has already identified 10% to 15% more frozen-food products as noncore, according to Gorin. 'Actions are being taken to rationalize the portfolio and focus on higher growth segments,' he says.   The company has also been criticized for not returning more of its cash on hand to shareholders, says Julian Lakin, an analyst with brokerage firm Pereire Tod in London, who rates Unilever accumulate. Cash flow in the first quarter grew 18%, to an impressive 970 million euros ($1.2 billion). Proceeding with special dividends to shareholders or stock buybacks are two methods of increasing investor interest, Lakin says.    Check-out line.  For now, Gorin says Unilever is focused on trimming debt to 10 billion euro ($12.1 billion) from the current 12.5 billion euros ($15.1 billion). After that, he says surplus cash generation 'will be used to enhance shareholder return.'   Since Unilever's founding in 1930, it has posted average annual earnings per share growth of 8%, Gorin adds. Over the same period, that bests the Dow Jones index of industrial companies by 20%, he says. And few doubt that Unilever is a formidable company. Even Langlois, who is negative on the stock, says 'management needs to be given more time' to improve the situation.  It's also true that Unilever faces multiple challenges, including growing competition in its traditionally high-margin and high-profit emerging markets. Still, investors hoping to see quick returns may want to consider giving Unilever more time before putting its shares in their shopping carts.

But with this week's almost simultaneous launch of Coca-Cola C2 and Pepsi Edge, both containing 50 percent less calories, carbohydrates, and sugar than regular sodas, the two soft-drink manufacturers will once again heat up their decades-old rivalry.  The difference is that the stakes are much higher and the competitive landscape much different since the debuts of Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi during the 1980s. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been desperately searching for ways to jump-start stagnant soft-drink sales as consumers buy more energy drinks and bottled water.  As obesity becomes a more serious health concern in the United States, critics are lumping Coca-Cola and Pepsi with the likes of Big Macs and Oreo cookies. Foodmakers ranging from General Mills Inc. to Kraft are scrambling to jump aboard the low-carb bandwagon before the phenomenon runs out of steam.  Whether C2 or Edge succeeds or simply fizzles out is anybody's guess, analysts say. For years, the companies have tried unsuccessfully to bridge the gap between diet and regular sodas (remember Pepsi One?). Soft-drink manufacturers also are not known for their innovation skills (remember New Coke?). But Gary Hemphill, senior vice president of Beverage Marketing Corp., a consulting firm in New York, credits Coca-Cola and Pepsi for trying to shake things up. Until now, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been content to develop flavor extensions such as Vanilla Coke or Mountain Dew Code Red, a less risky strategy that generates more sales 'but does not create heightened demand for carbonated soft drinks.' C2 and Edge 'are significant departures from the flavor innovations that the industry has pursued the past several years,' Hemphill said. 'It makes a lot of sense to focus on more functional [health] needs,' Hemphill said. 'There's greater potential here for longer term growth.' The industry could use a boost. Carbonated soft drinks sales increased only 0.4 percent last year, according to Beverage Marketing Corp. figures. Per-capita consumption dipped to 53.8 gallons from 54.2 gallons in 2002, the fifth consecutive year of such a decline. Flagship brands Coca-Cola Classic and Pepsi both lost market share. Only diet sodas showed strong growth. To fight what industry observers call 'cola fatigue,' both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are heavily hyping C2 and Edge. Coca-Cola spent an estimated $30 million to $50 million to promote C2, its biggest product launch since Diet Coke in 1982. In addition to television and Internet ads, Coca-Cola gave a million cases of C2 to employees, a new initiative called 'Ambassador Sampling.' With consumers interested in health and wellness products, C2 hits retailers at the right moment, said Jeffrey Laschen, vice president and general manager of Midwest Coca-Cola Bottling Co. in Eagan, whose territory includes the Twin Cities. 'Timing is everything and the timing is right now,' Laschen said. C2 'is a great platform to bring back people who left carbonated soft drinks for one reason or another. ... There are a whole segment of consumers looking for a diet beverage but don't like the taste.' Laschen thinks C2 could create a new category of soft drinks, similar to the way Anheuser-Busch positioned Michelob Ultra as a premium low-carb beer. C2 could play particularly well in the Twin Cities, Coca-Cola's largest market for diet sodas, he said. The question is whether C2 will attract new customers or siphon existing sales from Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Classic. 'Although C2 will cannibalize Coke and Diet Coke, the company is reasonable ... in expecting the brand to draw from noncarbs, as noncarbs, including water, have benefited from consumers' search for lower-calorie alternatives to regular soft drinks,' Mark Swartzberg, an analyst with Legg Mason, wrote in a recent research note. For Pepsi, Edge represents its latest attempt to fill the gap between diet and regular soda drinkers. The company estimates 60 million Americans are dual users -- they drink both regular and diet sodas. In 1998, Pepsi rolled out Pepsi One, which contains only one calorie, but it never caught on. 'Maybe it was ahead of its time,' said David DeCecco, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola North America. Pepsi One 'never found the scale nor the following we would have liked it to have.' With 20 grams of sugar, 20 grams of carbs, and 70 calories, Edge will appeal to consumers who want to make only gradual changes to their diets and lifestyles, DeCecco said.  'This isn't about just one product,' he said, 'but a fundamental change in how people drink soft drinks. ... People are paying more attention to what they eat and drink. We hope Edge helps people rediscover the soft drink aisle.' Not everyone is convinced. Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark, a consulting firm in Santa Barbara, Calif., said Coca-Cola and Pepsi are looking for a market that doesn't exist. 'To be honest, they are really wasting their time,' Pirko said. 'Consumers want either a full-flavor soda or they want to lose weight. C2 and Edge don't solve obesity issues at all. This piddling, little bit of this, little bit of that approach only confuses consumers. Pepsi One was a much more full-flavored soda, but it didn't work.' And by releasing C2 and Edge at the same time, Coca-Cola and Pepsi will only cancel each other out, he said. Harry Balzer, vice president and food analyst with NPD Group Inc., thinks the market is large enough for C2 and Edge to make their case. The brands will get consumers' attention because soft drinks are 'a high-interest category,' he said. 'I'm sure people will try them,' Balzer said. 'But will they have staying power?'

"             FOOD SECTOR - M&A   Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Acquires Silhouette Brands    Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Holdings Inc. has added firepower to its low-carbohydrate arsenal by acquiring Silhouette Brands, Inc. for $65.2 million in cash.   Based in New York and founded in 1994 by Marc Wexler and Sam Pugliese, Silhouette, whose brands feature low-fat and low-carb ice cream snacks marketed under the Skinny Cow and Skinny Carb labels, said in February it was seeking to be acquired.  For Dreyer's, the acquisition marks the next chapter in the company's ice cream-buying binge, which in February found the country's top-selling ice cream parent gobbling up the U.S. rights to Haagen-Dazs, including ownership of 236 stores.  Prior to the acquisition, Dreyer's acted as the national distributor for Silhouette Brands. Following this acquisition, Dreyer's anticipates significant administrative, selling, and management synergies; reduced costs; and raw material sourcing improvements.  As one of the fastest-growing partners in Dreyer's distribution portfolio in recent years, company officials said Silhouette Brands adds significant breadth to the ice cream assortment that Dreyer's offers consumers and retailers across the country. Silhouette Brands' executives, meanwhile, praised Dreyer's as an essential partner in its growth by providing direct-store distribution for many years.  Dreyer's paid Silhouette stockholders $4.76 for each common stock share and $6.56 for each preferred stock share held. The common stock price represented a 15 percent premium over Silhouette's closing stock price of $4.15 Friday.

That's according to new '5 A Day Foodservice Opportunity Gap' research and analysis presented by the Produce for Better Health Foundation (PBH) at a special 5 A Day Foodservice Summit held late last week in Monterey, Calif.  Hosted by PBH and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA), the invitation-only summit revealed a wide gap in fruit and vegetable offerings in quick-service, quick casual, family, and casual dining restaurants, 'which presents an opportunity for everyone to get what they want - customers, operators, and fruit and vegetable suppliers,' PBH foodservice director Brenda Humphreys told summit attendees.  Opening the conference by offering PBH's 'State of the Country' address, Humphreys noted that public health, public policy, and consumer health awareness are converging to create an environment conducive to change among foodservice operators, especially in these dining formats.  'The foodservice industry has been taking a lot of the heat for the obesity epidemic,' she said, adding that healthier menu options like fruits and vegetables offer chains a way to get out of the kitchen, or at least the kitchen of public opinion. Likewise, while the foodservice sector offers significant opportunity, it has largely been untapped by fruit and vegetable suppliers, Humphreys said, adding that with almost half of every American food dollar now being spent on food prepared away from home, 'the industry can't afford to overlook the market potential that exists in foodservice.'

Reflecting the positive mood of many logistics businesses, the company has put in a strong performance so far this year. Net revenues increased by 20% to CHF 4,246.9m (€2,759.9m) compared with the same period last year. Operating profit (EBITA) increased by 36.9% to CHF 181.6m  (€118m).  The good results were largely due to the performance of its air and sea forwarding division. Sea freight volumes grew by 25% with container traffic to and from Asia increasing by over 40%. Even volumes on the relatively weaker transatlantic trade lanes grew strongly with traffic up 12%. Operating profits improved by 16.3% in comparison with the same period in 2003.  The results were also buoyed by the integration of Pracht Spedition in Germany. The acquisition was a key driver of revenues in the company’s Road & Rail unit, with particularly strong demand for international and intermodal services. Meanwhile its Contract Logistics division doubled its operating profits to CHF20.2m (€13m) on a 5% increase of turnover to CHF581.1m (€377.6m). The unit has experienced problems over the past few years especially in the US, but a re-structuring combined with strong warehouse utilization in Europe has brought about a turnaround in fortunes.

'The growth is due to the introduction of a new hoarding campaign. At the beginning of the year we launched a two-week system replacing the previous monthly campaigns. This led to an increase in supply of billboards and cut display costs for customers,' said company president Janusz Malinowski. The price of a two-week campaign is cheaper by around 30% than a monthly campaign. According to company forecasts Stroer Polska will post profits of zł.3 million on revenues of zł.100 million this year. In 2005 the company plans to invest around zł.10 million on further development of its services.

The approval was given after Brazil's federal audit court cleared Petrobras's plans. The company has asked for permission to study and drill the fields in the next two to three years to study their commercial feasibility.  The authorization includes the Mexilhão field, in the Santos basin, where 419 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves have been found, the Golfinho field in the Espírito Santo basin where the company has found signs of light crude and the Baleia Franca field in the Campos basin, the news service reported.  The development of the Espírito Santo basin includes a US$500mn investment plan to build gas pipelines to shore and a liquefaction plant. The basin is seen to reach production of 100,000 barrels of oil a day (b/d), from the current 40,000b/d, and 1.1 million cubic meters of gas a day, Estrella told O Globo.   Petrobras should speed up production plans for most profitable fields, including light crude production, which should help the country be self-sufficient in oil by 2005, bringing forward self-sufficiency target from 2006, O Globo reported.   Petrobras currently produces 1.6mb/d in Brazil, accounting for about 80% of the country's oil needs.  Estrella declined to say how much would be invested in the development program but said the company invested US$500mn in the initial exploratory activities.    Mature fields   Separately, the development of Petrobras's mature fields by small and medium size companies will depend on talks between those companies and Petrobras, ANP board member Newton Monteiro told local press.  Petrobras has operation licenses for 40 mature fields that have low levels of productivity.  Monteiro, who was sworn in last week for a second four-year term as ANP board member, said small and medium size companies would have to seek partnerships with Petrobras to develop the fields.  It is part of ANP's policy to use the cheaper development of mature fields in Brazil as an incentive for the creation of small and medium sized oil and gas companies and development of local technology.  The 913 blocks that ANP plans to auction on August 17-19 in the sixth round of oil and gas exploration licenses include several mature fields.

The three countries announced the launch of the East Asia ICT (CJK) Summit in Tokyo on July 26, with all countries agreeing to exchange information on markets, technology trends and standardization activities while encouraging business partnerships and strategic alliances in both the public and private sectors.  The working group will run through December 2009 and include officials from governments, research institutes and private companies. The agreement resulted from a meeting of information and communication technology ministers from each country.   Korea, China and Japan had been cooperating in expanding broadband Internet coverage and developing new IT industry growth engines over the past few years. The East Asian region has put itself in a position to become the trendsetter in the global IT industry. The three countries have agreed to set up an advanced framework to cooperate on mobile communication, next generation Internet and open-source solutions among other sectors. We believe private companies to benefit greatly from this agreement.  Under the agreement, the three countries will continue recent efforts to develop open-source software, setting up the tentatively named 'Northeast Asia open-source software promotion forum,' comprised of working-level officials from industries, research institutes and other related organizations to promote open-source applications.   In other issues, the three countries decided to cooperate in developing third-generation mobile telephony and other wireless solutions, encouraging joint efforts in research and development of communication technologies and their standardization.   The working group will jointly develop solutions for the next-generation Internet, most notably Internet protocol version 6, and radio frequency identification technology. The sides will cooperate in the development and promotion of IPv6 application services, while leading the experiments in setting up an interoperable regional network for RFID.

Internet companies would love to see them.  As digital cameras continue their sales boom, Web sites have found an increasingly attractive business helping consumers share their photos with friends and family.  This month, two online photo-sharing services were bought within a 24-hour period. The technology publisher CNET Networks will pay $70 million for a longtime market leader, Webshots, and Google paid an undisclosed amount for a relative newcomer, Picasa.  The announcements came on the heels of a series of improvements from Yahoo Photos that have helped it leapfrog Webshots as the Internet leader in photo sharing.  Why all the activity? Analysts said a resurgence in the online advertising market had helped, along with a seemingly insatiable consumer appetite for digital photography.  'The digital camera adoption rate continues to defy expectations,' said Chris Chute, an analyst with the research and consulting firm IDC, who predicted that digital camera sales would reach 25 million this year. Including the 27 million camera phones that are expected to sell this year, at least one-third of American households will be able to take digital photos by year's end.  Chute said that 28 percent of digital-camera owners shared their pictures over the Internet and that cellphones and devices connected to home networks, for instance, would facilitate photo sharing.  Some online photo sites have had a surge in visitors in the past year, according to comScore Media Metrix, an Internet measurement firm, while others have leveled off. Yahoo and Webshots have had marginal declines in visitors, while Kodak's Ofoto.com, District Photo's Snapfish.com and Shutterfly.com attracted 25 percent to 30 percent more visitors. What is more, the value of those visitors has increased as the demand for online advertising has intensified.  Executives said those audience sizes were enticing enough for marketers to open their checkbooks. Narendra Rocherolle, co-chief executive of Webshots, said one reason Webshots chose CNET over other suitors was that it could help the company reach more well-known advertisers, because it already had long-term relationships with advertisers like Canon and Sony.  Webshots said it was profitable and expected to generate $12 million to $13 million in revenue this year, half from advertising and the remainder from selling premium online services and photo prints. CNET said it expected overall revenue for Webshots to grow by at least one-third next year.  Webshots, like several other photo-sharing sites, lets consumers upload their digital photos to a Web page on the site, free of charge. From there, users create albums, then e-mail invitations for others to look.  Webshots has faced increasing competition from Yahoo, which has in recent months added a number of features to enable users to share their photos more easily and decreased the number of places where advertisements appear.  Late last year, Yahoo began a service that allows users to view their photos on wireless phones. 'So instead of Dad pulling out his wallet for pictures, you can do it all electronically,' Jeff Stoddard, director of Yahoo Photos, said.  Even so, the smaller competitors have some advantages. Ofoto.com and Sony's Imagestation.com, for instance, have considerable muscle behind them, while Snapfish.com can rely on marketing support from District Photo, one of the biggest mail-order film processors.  Ofoto, Snapfish and Shutterfly.com have for years helped customers convert conventional photos into digital images they could e-mail to others. Now they, too, enable digital camera users to swap photos, or print them professionally for less than 20 cents an image.  Raj Kapoor, president of Snapfish, said the company had recently allowed camera phone users to e-mail images directly to their albums on the Snapfish site. This week the company will vastly expand the merchandise people can order decorated with their photos. The new items include dog leashes, baby bibs and neckties.  In this competitive market, Google's purchase of Picasa is particularly intriguing. Unlike most other services, Picasa is a peer-to-peer sharing application. Users open a window similar to that of instant messaging applications to swap photos.  Google declined to comment on its acquisition, citing the required 'quiet period' for companies that are about to sell shares to the public.

Both the German chains have been expanding in France especially and Western Europe, while Lidl is planning an assault on Central and Eastern Europe. The markets Lidl is targeting include Denmark, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia and Slovenia, where Aldi has no presence. Both retailers also want to expand in Switzerland and Norway, but Aldi is focused on growth in Canada and New Zealand, which could allow Lidl to push ahead in Europe. At present, Aldi is almost double the size of Lidl in Germany. Aldi has a German market share of 9.4% and 4,050 stores, while Lidl has 4.9% and 2,522 shops. Excluding Germany, Lidl already generates greater European sales than Aldi - E9bn sales, compared with E8bn - and looks likely to beat Aldi to the Continent's number one slot.

The company attributed the reduction in net loss to lower income taxes. Net sales, however, increased 1.7% during the quarter to reach Y144.2m/$1.3m. Sales at Shiseido's core cosmetics activity were up 2.1% to Y115.6m/$1.1m, offsetting a 3.1% decline in toiletries sales which reached Y13.3m/$121,120. By region, the group recorded a 0.5% dip in sales in its home country, its largest market, to Y103.8m/$945,673. Overseas sales fared better increasing 7.7% to Y40.4m/$368,238 with European sales climbing 12.7% to Y19.7m/$178,956.

The Dillons chain includes 180 stores selling newspapers, tobacco and grocery items. The mooted buyer is private convenience store chain TM Retail. Tesco acquired Dillons in autumn 2002 as part of its £357m acquisition of the T&S Stores neighbourhood store group, and has never seen it as core to its business. TM Retail is already one of the country’s biggest newsagent operators, owning the Martin’s and Forbuoys chains. In a related story, Tesco is reported to have signed a licensing deal with eDiets.com, the US Internet diet service. Tesco has paid £2m to acquire the UK and Ireland rights to eDiets.com’s technology. Tesco is reported to be planning to expand the service to enable dieters to order products recommended in their personalised meal plan to their door.

Indonesia's 'most admired company in 2003' in the toiletries and cosmetics category said it would invest another Rp4.5 trillion (US$500 million) in the country over the next 10 years.   The company claims that almost 99% of Indonesian households use at least one of its brands of soap, detergent, shampoo, cosmetics, toothpaste and food and beverage products, which include margarine, milk, ketchup and ice cream.   Indonesians get Unilever's highest-quality Lux soap at the lowest price in the world because, according to Unilever Indonesia's former president, Nihal Vijaya Devadas Kaviratne, the raw material is available in the country and the labor is productive and low-cost.   With household names such as Pepsodent, Sunsilk, Rinso, Surf, Lux and Lifebuoy, and the best-selling tea, Sariwangi, Unilever has cashed in on most, if not all, of several positive business factors in the world's fourth-biggest nation.   Net profits increased fivefold in the three years leading up to 2003, and sales are now more than before the 1997 Asian financial crisis.   Audited net profit surged by 33% last year on higher sales and amid strong consumer purchasing power. The company booked sales of Rp8.12 trillion against Rp7.01 trillion in 2002. Meanwhile, profit rose last year to Rp1.29 trillion ($151 million), or Rp170 per share, from Rp978 billion, or Rp128 per share, in 2002.   Dividend payments were Rp1.53 trillion ($162 million), or Rp200 per share, equivalent to 118% of Unilever's net profits for 2003. Unilever made the gesture to celebrate the company's 70th anniversary this year, but shareholders may have cause to be happy for some time to come as the company's strengths continue to grow.    Unilever takes off amid crisis  Though the company has operated in Indonesia for seven decades, it was not until the 1997 regional financial crisis that it really got into top gear.   Unilever and other multinationals quickly wired into the liberal investment regime in Indonesia in the wake of a change in the law in January 1999 that removed the 49% limit on foreign shareholding in Indonesian companies. A ban on foreign investment in the distribution business was also removed, making it easier for foreign companies to manufacture and distribute their own consumer goods. The protracted weakness of the rupiah in the years following the crisis and the consequent bargain brands for personal and household-care products also aided the company's expansion.   The company has made six acquisitions and joint ventures since 1999, including five local ones, the first of which was Yuhan. This deal gave Unilever the rights to the best-selling Moltos fabric conditioner and Superpell, a popular floor cleaner. Unilever then paid $120 million for Kecap Bango, the country's top-selling soy sauce. A portfolio of more than 65 brands was slashed in half to enable the company to focus on its strongest brands.   Private consumption has driven economic growth in Indonesia since the crisis, accounting for about 60% of the growth recorded. This, coupled with strong levels of household savings, a low-interest-rate environment and a predominantly young population, has helped lift the company's sales to new highs.   Though labor issues remain a problem in Indonesia, cheaper wage levels have been an added incentive for Unilever Indonesia to increase exports, particularly to other countries in the region.   Lower tariffs due to the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Free Trade Agreement are another positive factor. AFTA prompted the corporate decision to make Indonesia the regional sourcing center for a number of Unilever's products. Tea factories in Australia and Singapore were closed down and relocated to Indonesia, as were Lux and Lifebuoy soap factories previously located in Malaysia.  The AFTA agreement allows most products manufactured in one of the 10 ASEAN member states to be shipped to any other state at a 5% duty or less.   In addition to these factors, Unilever's expansion was also encouraged by the availability of raw material locally. The special taste of Kecap Bango, for example, derives from black soybeans, which grow only in Indonesia. To ensure continuity of supply, the company has struck deals with some 800 farmers who grow about 200 tons of black soybeans every year for Unilever.   Indonesia is also one of the world's major producers of palm oil, a primary raw material for many of the company's products. Industries under the Unilever group need about 1.7 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) every year, equivalent to 5% of the world's CPO production, which is about 22 million tons.  Globally, about 56% of Unilever's business is in food, while some 44% is in household and personal care products. In Indonesia, the household and personal-care business is growing at about 14-15%, but this rate is dwarfed by its food business. Food currently accounts for about 18% of the company's total business in Indonesia, but Unilever expects this to increase to about 25% by 2010.    A prime export position  Exports account for nearly 6% of turnover, though this is expected to increase to about 15%, approximately $150 million, within the next three to five years.   Products for export include toothpaste, which is manufactured in Indonesia and supplied to the Philippines and other countries in the region. In addition, all the tea and soap for the Asia-Pacific region are now supplied from Indonesia. Tea is also exported to Japan and Australia. Ice cream made in Indonesia is also a large export item and margarine will follow soon. Economies of scale make production costs very competitive, compared with players with a small market share and ensuing high costs.   Even the poor can afford at least some of their basic needs, with the widely available single-use packs of Rinso detergent and Sunsilk shampoo priced at Rp500 (5.5 cents).   With more than 20,000 distributors and at least 2 million retailers, there is little chance of major hiccups in getting the goods to the customers.   Of course, it's not all plain sailing for businesses in Indonesia. Labor-intensive factories have shut down because of competition from China. Sony decided more than a year ago that it was not worth the hassles and risks and left the country. Many other businesses chose to relocate their factories out of the country at the same time that Unilever was doing the opposite and relocating several factories from elsewhere in the region to Indonesia.   But Unilever is a classic example of how savvy companies that have long-running exposure to a country and understand the risks are prepared to invest further and also to reach out to other committed multinationals. A 50-50 joint venture with Kimberly-Clark, for instance, now produces Huggies diapers and Kotex feminine napkins in Indonesia.   In the Asia-Pacific region, stretching from Australia to India, and to China and Japan, Unilever's Indonesia business is bigger than that in Japan or Australia, and second in size only to India's.   Unilever's strong position in the Indonesian market and economies of scale explain its full-blooded commitment to go forward and also why it may be around for another seven decades to come.

The deal changes the continent’s financial landscape, but it is unlikely to spur rivals to do the same  It was widely expected, but no less eye-catching for that. On Monday July 26th, Abbey National, a British building society turned listed bank, said its board had accepted a takeover offer from Spain’s biggest bank, Santander Central Hispano (SCH). The shares-and-cash deal was valued at around £8.5 billion ($15.6 billion) when it was announced. If completed, it would be Europe’s largest retail-banking merger across borders.  Many a pundit had predicted that the European Union’s “single market” project and the introduction of the euro would lead to a flood of cross-border mergers in financial services. But, by and large, banks have shied away from such deal - which is why some of those pundits are talking of this week’s Anglo-Spanish union as a long-awaited milestone. There are several reasons for this reluctance. First, national markets still differ in lots of ways when it comes to financial regulation and taxation; as a result, a financial product that is popular in one country may be a non-starter in a neighbouring one. Added to this is continuing regulatory resistance to foreign takeovers: in some European countries - France being the most notable example - banking is considered a “strategic” industry that should be kept out of foreign hands.  Not so in Britain, but approval is not the same as success. Santander is paying a premium for Abbey. This is only worth paying if costs can be cut and profitability boosted. Domestic bank mergers have been popular in both Europe and America because of the scope they offer to close branches and crunch together back offices. By contrast, cross-border mergers are usually more about extending empires than cutting costs - and, since many an attempt at expansion into new markets has come a cropper, stockmarkets tend to frown on such deals. In this case, Santander is stressing cost-cutting as much as revenue-building, with annual savings of €500m ($606m) mooted, much of that coming from replacing Abbey’s out-of-date computer systems.  For the Spanish bank, the deal marks the end of a long search for a partner that would give it bulk in another European market. Santander’s driving force is Emilio Botin, its chairman, who inherited a small regional bank, Banco Santander, and turned it into the largest in Spain and the biggest foreign bank in Latin America, through a series a bold acquisitions. In 1999, Mr Botin brought together Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano, a smaller bank. Since then, he has made no secret of wanting to get the group into the global top ten.  Britain was always the focus of his search for a new partner. The reason was, in a word, efficiency. The best Spanish banks make very nice profits - on the day the Abbey takeover was announced, Santander unveiled first-half net profits of €1.91 billion - and they want partners that are in the same league. British banks fit the bill: like their Spanish counterparts, they have been able to merge with each other, jettison overlapping bits of their networks, and so on. As a result, their return on equity tends to be above that of banks in countries like France, Germany and Italy, where obstacles to restructuring have held profits back.  However, Abbey is hardly the pick of the bunch. Having been a steady earner in retail banking and mortgages for years, it started to lose its way in the late 1990s - so much so, in fact, that it made pre-tax losses of £947m in 2002 and £686m last year. Dabbling in junk bonds proved particularly disastrous. Abbey’s life-insurance division has also been a worry, but the recent announcement that it would not have to stump up more capital under new regulatory rules was seen as removing the last obstacle to a bid. Abbey is halfway through a three-year turnaround programme designed to return it to its profitable ways of old.  Abbey’s rocky recent history may reduce the chances of a counter-bid emerging. Moreover, tightly run American banks are likely to balk at the premium payable, while most continental European banks simply can’t afford it. One or two of Abbey’s domestic rivals would like to bid, but they know they would face imposing regulatory hurdles. In 2001, Lloyds TSB was forced by the Competition Commission to withdraw a bid for Abbey.  The Abbey/Santander tie-up is not yet a done deal. Though it has been welcomed by Abbey’s board, the bank’s mostly British shareholders must vote on it, and many of them are less than thrilled at the prospect of their shares being turned into Spanish paper, with the currency risk that goes with it. However, they may still vote for the merger and dump their shares at an opportune moment soon after it is completed.  If the deal does go ahead, it would create a new giant in Europe, but it probably wouldn’t herald a wave of copycat cross-border mergers. As long as the continent’s financial-services markets retain their national quirks, banks will worry about straying from home turf. Santander’s rivals will want to wait and see how it fares as it grapples with its bulky British bride. After all, bank mergers have an unhappy history, whether domestic or cross-border: more often than not, the cost savings and revenue gains achieved (as opposed to promised) fall far short of the premium paid by the acquirer. Is it different this time? If history is a guide, probably not.  Source;  The Economist, July 04              ",13.727,10.929,13.204,0.589,0.492,43.764,24.35,0.045,0.85,0.105,14.193,17.75,5.21,2

En un hecho relevante remitido a la Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), Terra dijo que ya 'ha seleccionado a un posible comprador de su filial en EE.UU., Lycos Inc, por un precio inicial en el rango de US$ 95 a 115 millones'. Terra Lycos dijo que su consejo de administración autorizó la operación, aunque señaló que aún faltaban algunos detalles para lograr un acuerdo definitivo. La compañía Terra Lycos no reveló el nombre del posible comprador, pero el diario español Expansión dijo el miércoles que se trata de un grupo surcoreano. La firma indicó que antes de la compraventa estaba prevista la transferencia de diversos activos de la filial estadounidense a la matriz, incluida la participación de casi un 30% que Lycos posee en Lycos Europe. Terra Lycos dijo a finales de junio que contaba con cuatro ofertas sólidas por Lycos tras anunciar meses a! ntes que estaba analizando y revisando determinadas unidades operativas, incluido su portal estadounidense. Terra Networks, la filial de Internet de Telefónica, adquirió en mayo de 2000 el control de Lycos en una operación valorada en unos US$ 12.500 millones. Tras realizar amortizaciones extraordinarias en los últimos años, Telefónica redujo el valor en libros del portal estadounidense Lycos a US$ 75 millones. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    CHILE - NEGOCIOS    La chilena Falabella compra supermercados San Francisco   El mayor grupo minorista de Chile, Falabella, informó que adquirió el control de la firma local de supermercados San Francisco, el tercer actor del rubro en el país, en una operación valorada en US$ 62,5 millones.  El conglomerado Falabella posee actualmente una cadena de multitiendas en Chile, Perú y Argentina bajo su marca, tiendas de artículos para el hogar Sodimac en Chile y Colombia, supermercados Tottus en Perú y es accionista de la red de farmacias Ahumada y de centros comerciales Plaza. Con este acuerdo, Falabella da su primer paso en el negocio de los supermercados en Chile, cuyos protagonistas son las compañías D&S y Cencosud y se consolida como el principal grupo minorista diversificado de Sudamérica. 'La operación involucra la compra por parte de Falabella del 88% de la propiedad de Supermercados San Francisco en un monto cercano a los US$ 62,5 millones', dijo la empresa en un comunicado. San Francisco posee ocho locales, principalmente en la zona suroeste! de Santiago, emplea a 1.600 personas y tiene una participación de mercado de 7,2% en la capital y 3,2% a nivel nacional. En 2003 sumó ventas por US$ 160 millones en 31.000 metros cuadrados de salas. 'Es un paso lógico en el crecimiento de Falabella. Si habían logrado entrar en Perú exitosamente en supermercados, el paso que les faltaba era en Chile', dijo la analista de Larraín Vial, Celine Bourban. La propiedad de San Francisco estaba en manos de la familia chilena Leyton Francione, que recibió su pago por el 88% en dinero y acciones de Falabella pero mantuvo el 12% restante. Los planes de la cadena de supermercados para el segundo semestre apuntan a sumar otros dos locales y la ampliación de una de sus tiendas en el sur de Santiago. Falabella destacó en su informe que un aspecto que fortalecerá este acuerdo con San Francisco es la eventual utilización de su tarjeta de crédito CMR, repartida entre 2,5 millones de clientes. 'Con San Francisco van a intentar aportar una solución diferente al cliente, algo que los diferencie de Cencosud y D&S. Y su fortaleza va a ser su tarjeta de crédito, que está muy desarrollada con respecto a sus competidores', agregó Bourban. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    ARGENTINA - ECONOMIA   Una demora en la revisión del FMI no sería una catástrofe   Argentina reconoció el miércoles que una ya demorada revisión del acuerdo con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) podría atrasarse aún más, hasta después del receso veraniego en agosto, pero que ello no significaría 'una catástrofe'.  Argentina está negociando desde junio la aprobación de la tercera revisión de su programa de US$ 13.000 millones a tres años con el FMI, lo que liberaría desembolsos del organismo por US$ 735 millones. El país utiliza esos fondos para pagar sus propios vencimientos con el FMI. 'Mire, yo trabajo con la hipótesis de que eso es posible', dijo Héctor Torres, el representante argentino ante el FMI, sobre si aún creía factible que el directorio de la entidad apruebe la revisión antes del 9 de agosto, cuando el directorio del organismo toma su descanso anual de dos semanas. 'Pero evidentemente los días pasan, el receso veraniego se acerca y, si bien yo sigo trabajando (para su aprobación), evidentemente es cada vez un poco menos ! posible', agregó. Las declaraciones de Torres son la primera admisión pública de que la revisión podría demorarse hasta septiembre, momento en que el FMI debería iniciar la cuarta revisión. Esa revisión es considerada crucial por los analistas porque ambas partes deberán acordar las metas de superávit fiscal primario para el próximo año, una variable clave para un país que está reestructurando la deuda pública incumplida de unos US$ 100.000 millones. 'Si no lo hace (aprobar la revisión) antes del receso veraniengo, se hará después del receso veraniego. En definitiva, yo no creo que eso sea una catástrofe', dijo Torres. En su acuerdo firmado a fines de septiembre de 2003, Argentina y el FMI acordaron someter la marcha del acuerdo a revisiones trimestrales, lo que implica que la tercera revisión debería haberse terminado a fines de junio, aunque las demoras son comunes. La economía de Argentina ha experimentado una saludable recuperación y tiene amplias reservas para! cubrir los pagos al Fondo, pero en el pasado el presidente Néstor Kirchner se ha negado a cancelar deudas con el organismo cuando el directorio de la entidad demoró otras revisiones. Sin embargo, en esta ocasión la situación presenta un elemento particular. Argentina espera tener a mediados de agosto la aprobación del ente regulador del mercado financiero estadounidense a su oferta de reestructuración de deuda, y según los analistas sería riesgoso para el país lanzar esa propuesta al mercado sin tener el aval del FMI. La demora en la revisión también retrasa el desembolso de un crédito por US$ 500 millones por parte del Banco Mundial, cuyo directorio aprobó el préstamo pero lo condicionó a que la economía argentina tuviera el visto bueno del FMI. El Fondo dice que Argentina aún no realiza algunas reformas fiscales incluidas en el programa, como la aprobación de una ley que regula la distribución de los ingresos entre las provincias y el gobierno central. Argentina argumenta q! ue ha sobrecumplido las metas macroeconómicas del acuerdo y ha pedido una exoneración por la demora en las reformas, cuyo objetivo es asegurar el futuro cumplimiento de las metas fiscales y monetarias. 'Lo que estamos diciendo es que no tiene sentido prender una luz roja, en un momento en el cual todos los indicadores macroeconomicos están 'outperforming' (sobrecumplidos)', dijo Torres. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    MEXICO - NEGOCIOS    La mexicana Femsa sube su utilidad neta en el segundo trimestre   La embotelladora mexicana Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF) reportó el miércoles una utilidad neta de 1.724 millones de pesos (US$ 150 millones) en el segundo trimestre, casi cuatro veces más que mismo lapso de 2003, por mayores ventas tras la adquisición de Panamco.  KOF, segunda mayor embotelladora de Coca-Cola en el mundo y unidad estelar de la gigante de bebidas Femsa, tuvo ingresos por 11.074 millones de pesos, un crecimiento de 17% frente al segundo trimestre de 2003. KOF se convirtió en la principal embotelladora de productos Coca-Cola en América Latina y la segunda en el mundo, tras concluir en mayo la compra de Panamco por US$ 2.700 millones, más US$ 880 millones en deuda. Con operaciones en nueve países de América Latina desde México a Argentina, KOF es propiedad en 51% de Femsa, mientras que The Coca-Cola Company posee casi 40%. En México, KOF enfrenta la dura competencia de pequeños embotelladores independientes como Big Cola y Jarritos, que han puesto a la venta refrescos de! menor precio en presentaciones más grandes, lo que ha causado un impacto negativo en los volúmenes de Coca-Cola y Pepsi. 'Estamos enfrentando un entorno muy difícil en términos de volúmenes y precios', dijo Héctor Treviño, director de Finanzas de KOF en conferencia telefónica con analistas. Los ingresos de la firma en México sumaron 6.710 millones de pesos. Pero el clima fresco y lluvioso de mayo en el centro del país golpeó las ventas y los volúmenes cayeron 6%, debido principalmente a menores volúmenes de agua embotellada. México, el principal mercado de KOF, representó 78,2% de las ganancias operativas del trimestre, seguido por Colombia con 5% y América Central con 4,8%.(US$ 1 = 11,49 pesos al cierre de junio) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    PUBLICIDAD - INTERNET   El gasto en publicidad online será de US$ 16.000 millones en 2009   El gasto de publicidad en Internet casi se duplicaría en 2009, a US$ 16.100 millones, y representará una porción mayor en los presupuestos publicitarios, dijo JupiterResearch.  La publicidad en Internet crecerá un 27% este año, a US$ 8.400 millones, con un crecimiento de más del 10% tanto en listados de búsqueda pagos como en ventanas de anuncios, dijo Jupiter en un reporte. Jupiter es una división de Jupitermedia Corp. Se espera que la publicidad en este medio incremente su participación en los presupuestos de marketing desde 3,5% el año pasado a 6,5% en 2009. Los principales analistas de la industria publicitaria han pronosticado un crecimiento del gasto publicitario en EE.UU. de entre 6 y 9% este año, apoyado en la firme recuperación económica, las campañas políticas por las elecciones presidenciales y los Juegos Olímpicos Atenas 2004. La publicidad online es vista ampliamente como el medio de mayor crecimiento en esta categoría, seguido por la televisión por cable, en un ! regreso con gloria tras la explosión de la burbuja de Internet en 2000. Los principales anunciantes han incrementado el gasto en publicidad online ya que los consumidores dedican cada vez más tiempo a navegar en la Web, y tecnologías cada vez más sofisticadas facilitan crear y dar seguimiento a las campañas en Internet.

Entrevistado en Ginebra, donde se encuentra para negociar ese acuerdo destinado a relanzar la ronda de Doha y para cuya conclusión la propia Organización Mundial del Comercio ha puesto como fecha tope este viernes, afirmó que actualmente 'el campo de juego está desnivelado'.  De modo especial criticó el intento de fraguar 'una nueva caja azul', categoría de apoyos internos destinados en principio a programas para limitar la producción, pero que Estados Unidos quiere utilizar para acomodar en ella las multimillonarias ayudas incluidas en la 'Farm Bill' (ley agrícola).  'Tal y como está configurada la nueva caja azul, permitiría a algunos países miembros aumentar sus ayudas internas y los subsidios a la producción', criticó Redrado, quien sostuvo que 'de esa forma se sacralizaría la 'Farm Bill' de 2002, que debe revisarse en el 2006'.  Sin embargo, dijo estar igualmente preocupado por el hecho de que el llamado 'nivel de mínimis' (porcentaje de ayudas internas exentas en principio de compromisos de reducción) pueda sumarse a esa caja azul y aumentar el nivel total de apoyo al sector. Pero reconoció que en las últimas reuniones celebradas en Ginebra hay una voluntad de asegurar que cualquier cambio que se introduzca en la caja azul no sea 'a suma de los distintos subsidios distorsionantes' de la competencia. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    BRASIL - NEGOCIOS   Arcor opera con Danone en Brasil   Si bien en términos legales se espera que la fusión con Groupe Danone para la creación de una sociedad conjunta bajo la denominación de Bagley S.A. esté aprobada el 2 de enero del año próximo, en la práctica, Arcor ya comenzó a administrar el negocio de galletitas del holding francés en Brasil.  Tras haber suscripto un contrato de management en los primeros días de julio, Arcor Do Brasil Ltda. se hizo cargo de las operaciones en el principal socio del Mercosur y así logró desembarcar en el único mercado de la región en el que no tenía fuerte presencia.  La operación forma parte del acuerdo para crear una nueva sociedad mixta que, además de Brasil, abarcará a la Argentina y Chile. El 51% del capital será controlado por Arcor mientras que el 49% restante quedará para Danone. Además, Luis Pagani ejercerá la presidencia.  A nivel local, Bagley se convertirá en la empresa de galletitas líder, con 42% del mercado; será segunda en Brasil, con 10%, y tercera en Chile, con 16% gracias a Dos en Uno, subsidiaria de Arcor. En total, producirá 255.000 toneladas anuales y reunirá un portafolio de marcas entre las que se destacan Saladix, Maná, Serranitas, Recetas de la Abuela, Formis, Macucas, Lía, Hogareñas, Opera, Rex y Sonrisas. Para evaluar el impacto del negocio en su operación global, Arcor contrató al JP Morgan Chase. En un informe elaborado para la compañía el banco sostuvo que la asociación con Danone 'reforzará la viabilidad y la plataforma regional de Arcor en Latinoamérica, incrementando masa crítica en un mercado trascendental como Brasil'. La entidad financiera estimó también que la operación le permitirá a Arcor superar los U$S 1.000 millones en ventas consolidadas y duplicar su presencia en el mercado brasileño. El convenio firmado entre Arcor Do Brasil y Groupe Danone se denomina Brazil Management Services Agreement y prevé que la filial brasileña de la empresa de la familia Pagani administre el negocio de galletitas de ambos grupos a partir de los primeros días de este mes. En el país vecino el holding francés ocupa el segundo lugar en market share, con 10% del total con marcas líderes como Triunfo y Aymoré. La producción del sector en Brasil es de 800.000 toneladas, 7% de la producción mundial y ampliamente superior a las 250.000 toneladas que se produjeron en la Argentina en 2003.  De este modo, la compañía de Arroyito hereda un interesante negocio que le permitirá posicionarse entre las líderes, puesto obtenido por Danone después de 10 años de actividades desde que, en 1994, ingresó en el mercado de galletitas en sociedad Cía. Campineira de Alimentos, dueña de la marca Triunfo. En 1998 llevó sus marcas Danyt’s e Break ’Up y dos años después adquirió Aymoré, consolidándose como una de las mayores empresas de galletitas de Brasil. Luego unificó todo bajo el nombre de LU, marca internacional de Danone, que fue fundada en Francia en 1846 por la familia Lefevre-Utile y que fabrica galletitas con valor nutritivo. La unidad de negocios LU opera en Brasil a través de dos plantas ubicadas en Campinas (San Pablo), y Contagem (Belo Horizonte). Frente a este escenario, el JP Morgan Chase destacó en el informe que la transacción provee una complementariedad importante de cartera de productos y canales con Arcor Do Brasil 'que debería contribuir a potenciar la plataforma ya establecida en los últimos años en ese mercado'. El banco también estima que 'crea un portafolio combinado que agrupa a productos con años de tradición y con nuevas marcas en proceso de desarrollo', y asegura que la asociación con Danone 'resalta la capacidad gerencial de Arcor, su potencialidad como socio para jugadores interesados en la región y abre una nueva alternativa de crecimiento para el grupo a través de asociaciones'. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    CHILE - ECONOMIA   Las fusiones y adquisiciones en Chile caen un 60% entre enero y junio   El monto de las fusiones y adquisiciones de empresas en Chile cayó un 60% en la primera mitad de 2004 con respecto a igual lapso del año pasado, con un total de US$ 769 millones, según un informe de la gremial Cámara de Comercio de Santiago divulgado el lunes.  Pese a la disminución en los montos involucrados, el número de operaciones aumentó significativamente, desde 15 en el primer semestre de 2003 a 30 entre enero y junio de este año. 'No es posible concluir que el proceso de fusiones y adquisiciones se haya debilitado en el último año', dijo la entidad aludiendo a recientes transacciones. Las operaciones del período abarcaron una amplia gama de sectores, como telecomunicaciones, energía, industria, minoristas y servicios financieros. El negocio de las instituciones financieras concentró un 42% de los montos totales involucrados en el primer semestre. La compañía de seguros La Construcción fue adquirida por Bicecorp, mientras que el Grupo Security compró el Dresdne! r Bank Chile. El negocio minorista sólo registró un 3,8% de las operaciones en los primeros seis meses, lo que se explica básicamente por la venta de los supermercados Las Brisas al grupo chileno Cencosud. 'Las recientes fusiones y adquisiciones se encuentran relacionadas a procesos de reordenamiento de la estructura competitiva de algunos sectores y en otros tienen que ver con la entrada o consolidación de actores internacionales', dijo el gremio en su informe trimestral. Para la segunda parte de 2004 se espera un salto en materia de fusiones y adquisiciones, pues a mediados de julio se aprobó la venta de la filial celular de CTC Chile a la española Telefónica Móviles en US$ 1.301 millones. En 2003 las fusiones y adquisiciones en Chile sumaron un total de US$ 2.855 millones, monto muy similar al del año anterior. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    MEXICO - ECONOMIA   Banco de México endurece su política monetaria    El Banco de México endureció su política monetaria por cuarta vez en el año, al incrementar el 'corto', o herramienta de control, a $41 millones diarios desde $37 millones, después de que la inflación de la primera quincena de julio superara las expectativas del mercado.  El banco central justificó la medida citando aumentos recientes en la inflación subyacente -que elimina factores volátiles- alza en las expectativas de inflación en 12 meses, el inicio de un ciclo restrictivo en la política monetaria estadounidense y la recuperación de la economía mexicana. México tiene como objetivo una inflación de 3% anual, con un margen de un punto porcentual sobre y bajo esta cifra. Sin embargo, hasta ahora la inflación en 12 meses se mantiene persistentemente sobre el 4%.

"            HIGHLIGTS    Legal – Human rights    urlLink The Age of Comparative Atrocity    American shame; Islamist snuff movies  It's a tough call whether Abu Musab al-Zarqawi-the Jordanian 'militant' who is reportedly responsible for the videotaped butchery of Nicholas Berg-is more stupid than he is brutal, or whether he is a bigger monster than he is a fool. Zarqawi's own nauseating videotape makes the case for his indescribable brutality. The argument that he is Islamism's biggest lunatic yet-no small claim-is similarly straightforward: He has inaugurated an otherwise inconceivable display of comparative atrocity that could deliver his enemy from its own demoralization.   After all, Americans have been sufficiently shamed, dishonored, and demoralized by the repulsive images of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib that even many prominent war supporters have been reconsidering the effort.  Dispirited analysts at the conservative National Review Online have been looking for an exit from the occupation; blogger Andrew Sullivan has asked himself if, knowing in advance how the occupation would proceed, he would have supported the war to begin with. New York Times columnist David Brooks has concluded that the United States misconceived the effect of its own power, and has pronounced the occupation an intellectual failure, even if it ultimately succeeds in establishing a liberal Iraq.   What does Zarqawi do? In 'retaliation' for the Abu Ghraib imagery, he stages a singularly nauseating 'execution' of a private American citizen who has been wandering around Iraq. The probable effect is to offer many Americans an exit from their own moral horror.   Mind you, Zarqawi's ghouls in this video don't merely 'behead' Berg, as most accounts indicate. 'Beheading' suggests a quick severing and a quick death. What Zarqawi and his friends do is butcher Berg-there's no other word for it. They don't use a sword or an axe; they use a knife. You can hear Nicholas Berg screaming as Zarqawi's gang hacks at his neck and then pulls at his head until it comes off his body. They then hold his bleeding head in front of the camera. The tape is appalling not only for its utter bloodthirstiness, but also for the total absence of simple human empathy.  Elemental empathy-for example, an unwillingness to rip a victim’s heads from his body-is a primary measure of civilization. (The shame Americans felt at the Abu Ghraib an image is, after all, rooted in such empathy.) Even in the dehumanizing context of warfare, which strains the empathy of all its participants, this is savagery.   But if this is a moment of comparative atrocity, the issue becomes whether the Zarqawi horror is capable of having any effect on the Abu Ghraib images.  The probable answer is that while the murder tape obviously doesn't make pictures of prisoner abuse any less disgusting or shameful, it does offer many of those who feel disgust and shame a different context in which to perceive those images.   The Abu Ghraib pictures reveal American soldiers humiliating their prisoners in a sadistic manner (in some images, the Americans are actually smirking). It's a painful sight because it is cruel on its own terms (we don't even know if the terrorized individual prisoners are actually guilty of anything), and because we regard such sadism as unworthy of our image of ourselves.   Indeed, the pictures are sufficiently difficult that American newspaper editors are increasingly unsure how to play the images that continue to appear. Perhaps sensing a rise of 'shame fatigue,' some editors have been moving newer images to inside pages. As Washington Post editor Leonard Downie, Jr. put it, '[W] e decided we had published so many shocking photos that it was fine to publish inside rather than on the front page.'   By contrast, Zarqawi intentionally tapes and distributes his bloody atrocity; the literal slaughter of an innocent is offered as an example of his righteousness. 'Unworthiness' simply never enters the calculation; that it is inhuman is its point. Shameless brutality of this degree has the power to transform the shame of Zarqawi's enemies (those who seek such transformation). Zarqawi has reminded his enemies that, unlike him, they are capable of shame.   One rarely encounters an enemy willing to dehumanize himself this way. It's not unknown: Genghis Khan, sweeping out of Mongolia in the 13th century, sent out an advance phalanx of rumormongers to spread tales of massacre and cruelty, in order to encourage the cities in his path to surrender the more quickly. But that strategy was based on the Mongols' strength, and the relative weakness of the cities that various waves of Mongol armies were intent on sacking, (Baghdad was ultimately among them).   That's hardly the situation in which Zarqawi and his allies find themselves. If the U.S. has a military weakness, it's the one that Vietnam's Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap identified: Wars can be won on the American home front. But you try to win such a war by demoralizing the populace, not by demonstrating your own butchery. Revealing yourself as a butcher only encourages your enemies to find you and kill you.   That's the whole point of atrocity images and stories, both true and false, from Trajan's Column in Rome to the notorious false stories spread during World War I to the phony anti-Iraq baby-incubator testimony of the first Gulf War: to dehumanize the foe. That's the business of the Pan-Arab press: delegitimizing the American effort in Iraq by portraying it in terms of atrocity. In the case of an Al Jazeera, it has been to display civilian corpses; in the case of some Pan-Arab newspapers, it has been to augment genuine pictures of prisoner abuse with stills from pornographic films, and to claim that such stills are also from Abu Ghraib.   That sort of thing is recognizable propaganda in a classic mode. Zarqawi's righteous snuff movie is something different: an act of lunacy, a gift to his enemies, and, one hopes, an unwitting suicide note.

The biggest pan-Arab satellite television channels broadcast an edited version of the gruesome video, not showing the actual killing of Nick Berg, 26, of West Chester, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb. The businessman was abducted in April.   In one of the most explicit displays, Kuwait's Al-Siyassah daily ran a photo of a masked militant holding up Berg's severed head.   The video of the execution was released on the Internet too late for some Middle East newspaper columnists to react to it. The killing, attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's group, appalled many Arabs.   Some opinion-makers condemned the killing.   'This shows how base and vile those who wear the robe of Islam have become,' said Abdullah Sahar, a Kuwait University political scientist.   Some said it surpassed the American military's abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison, which has been the top story for the past 10 days in the Middle East.   'We were winning international sympathy because of what happened at Abu Ghraib, but they come and waste it all,' said Abdullah Sahar, a Kuwait University political scientist, said of the Islamic militants responsible.   In the video, the masked militants said they were taking revenge on Berg because of the abuses at the Baghdad prison.   Mustafa Bakri, editor of Al-Osboa weekly newspaper in Egypt, said Berg's death will only hurt efforts to expose American offenses against Iraqis.   'Such revenge is rejected,' Bakri said of the execution. 'The American administration will make use of such crimes just to cover their real crimes against Iraqis.'   Bakri spoke as he took part in a Cairo demonstration by about 50 Egyptian journalists and lawyers against American human rights abuses in Iraq.   Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya, the big two satellite networks, aired carefully edited versions of the video. In Al-Arabiya's edit, a militant is seen drawing a knife and jerking Berg's body to one side. The rest is not shown.   'The news story itself is strong enough,' said Jihad Ballout, spokesman for Qatar-based Al-Jazeera. 'To show the actual beheading is out of the realm of decency.'   Lebanon's private Al Hayat-LBC station led its bulletins Wednesday with the video. Its news presenter said: 'We apologize to our viewers for not showing the entire tape because of the ugliness of the scene.'   Kuwait state television broadcast the news of the execution late Tuesday but not the video.   Iraqi newspapers reported nothing about the killing, although it may have broken to late for them.   Egypt's leading daily, Al-Ahram, ignored the beheading Wednesday. Two other major pro-government newspapers ran news agency reports on their inside pages, without photos.   An Al-Ahram editor, Ahmed Reda, said the news came too late Tuesday night for the paper to confirm the video's authenticity with the U.S. government.   Newspapers in Syria, where the government controls the press tightly, did not report it at all.   A professor of journalism at the American University in Cairo, Hussein Amin, said the handling of the story by Egypt's pro-government papers was political and appropriate.   'I think that the government does not want to show this on the front page as a main item because it shows a very poor - poor is not the proper word; disgusting maybe is the better word - example of revenge,' Amin said. 'There is also the threat that it could be happening to other Americans. If they put it on the front page, (it could be seen as) they are favoring this kind of action.'   Jordanian newspapers, state television and radio reported Berg's killing, but without commentary.   Most Lebanese newspapers, such as the left-wing As-Safir, published the report and a photograph of Berg sitting in front of the militants. As-Safir ran the headline: 'Al-Zarqawi slaughters an American to avenge Iraqi prisoners.'   In many Arab newspapers, the beheading received less display than the news of America's imposing sanctions on Syria and the killing of six Israeli soldiers in Gaza City.

In Afghanistan, opium is everywhere. The United Nations says the burgeoning poppy crop produced three-quarters of the world's illicit opium last year, worth $3.2 billion Cdn and accounting for half Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Output was 20 times more than in 2001, the last year of rule by the strict Taliban regime.   Returning from a recent conference with donor countries, President Hamid Karzai called on Afghans to wage a 'jihad,' or holy war, on the drug trade.   It was a politically risky move. Poppy farming supports thousands of families and is a major source of income for many powerful warlords.   On a recent day, a counter-narcotics team in Kandahar province fanned out across farms, flanked by a dozen bodyguards armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades.   In the town of Karezeq, farmers confronted the team at the edge of fields pink with blooming poppies.   An elderly farmer begged for an officer to 'be a good Muslim' and leave his crops alone. The response was quick: 'It's the opium that you grow that's un-Islamic.'   Eventually, they compromised: One-third of the plants would be uprooted. The farmers glumly watched as tractors tore up the earth.   Karzai's government says the goal is not to destroy farmers' livelihoods, but to encourage planting legal crops. While wheat and corn are nowhere near as profitable, at least the farmers know those crops will get to market, officials say.   The vast majority of the poppy crop is exported to meet the demand for drugs in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, but some stay at home, feeding a growing addiction problem.   In the slums of western Kabul, devastated by three decades of war, opium addicts gather in bullet-pocked ruins, sheltering in basement rooms littered with used needles and burned matches. They heat opium powder into a liquid and inhale the vapour.   Counsellors from the Najat drug rehabilitation centre scour Kabul for addicts, offering first-aid and encouragement. Female doctors meet at the homes of women addicts, and dozens of burqua-clad addicts come for checkups.  Each week, dozens of addicts hope desperately for one of the few beds Najat offers for in-house rehabilitation.   Once accepted, they spend weeks in cramped rooms, relearning responsibility and personal hygiene, receiving medical attention and counselling, and trying to get clean.   Feradoon, 42, can barely dream of kicking his habit. He meets every day with other addicts in the ruins of an old Kabul cinema.   They have no one else to turn to. In a culture where family is everything, these men are shunned by their relatives.  'No one can stop using this drug when he is alone,' Feradoon says.

Argentina is currently undergoing a serious energy crisis with domestic shortages and reduced overseas sales with diplomatic consequences in the region.Minister Julio De Vido  'The government decided the creation of Argentina Energy S.A., Enarsa, with the purpose of participating in the hydrocarbons and energy markets through the rational exploitation of resources', said Planning Minister Julio De Vido during a press conference in Government House in Buenos Aires.  The objective of Enarsa is to ensure the availability of gas and electricity at prices compatible with the economic level of the country and 'rebuild reserves, production levels, gas supplies together with infrastructure needs in the transport of gas and electricity', added Mr. De Vido.  Enarsa will be made up of 53% non-transferable shares belonging to the government, 12% to the Argentine provinces and 35% will be offered to the private sector. Enarsa that is expected to associate with private companies to explore and exploit different fuels is the first government company in the local hydrocarbons market since the Argentine government privatized YPF and Gas del Estado in the nineties. Several private companies have anticipated they will work closely with the Argentine government in the energy emergency.  Brazilian Petrobras promised to double the transport capacity of its gas pipeline that extends 3,300 kilometres from Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego to Buenos Aires, which means an additional 2,8 million cubic meters in 2005 and another eight million cubic meters in 2006.  Repsol-YPF also is committed to increase gas production by 9,5 million cubic meters.  Argentina has abundant reserves of natural gas but the lack of investments during several years and a booming economy have caused a bottle neck with shortages both for the domestic industrial market and overseas, mainly Chile.  'If we have an energy crisis in Argentina today, unfortunately it's because corporations have not been investing particularly since 1998', said President Nestor Kirchner. The Kirchner administration also decided to increase taxes and retentions on hydrocarbon and fuel exports in an attempt to discourage overseas sales and ensure domestic supply.

A reporter at the scene said that gangs of young men torched and looted Christian properties on Gyadi-Gyadi Court Road in a mainly Muslim area of the city, triggering explosions in a cooking gas store. Police jeeps were racing around the area, with heavily armed officers sporadically firing warning shots, but security forces appeared to be holding back to avoid triggering a full-scale confrontation with the mob. Most businesses, including the main Christian market in the minority community's ghetto, Sabon Gari, had been closed before Tuesday's mass rally called in protest at last week's attack on the Muslim town of Yelwa. There was no sign of any casualties in the violence. On Sunday last week a heavily armed gang of militants from the Christian Tarok ethnic group stormed the mainly Muslim rural town of Yelwa, in the Shendam local government area of central Nigeria's Plateau state, and killed between 200 and 300 people, according to government figures.  At Tuesday's protest, Islamic leaders demanded that President Olusegun Obasanjo put an end to the Plateau state crisis within seven days 'or bear the blame of whatever happens'.

In Najaf, the clerical establishment and the shopkeepers have called on the Mahdi Army of Muqtada al-Sadr to quit their city, and to 'pursue another way.' It is in Washington where the lines are breaking, and where the faith in the gains that coalition soldiers have secured in Iraq at such a terrible price appears to have cracked. We have been doing Iraq by improvisation; we are now 'dumping stock,' just as our fortunes in that hard land may be taking a turn for the better. We pledged to give Iraqis a chance at a new political life. We now appear to be consigning them yet again to the same Arab malignancies that drove us to Iraq in the first place.  We have stumbled in Abu Ghraib. But the logic of Abu Ghraib isn't the logic of the Iraq war. We should be able to know the Arab world as it is. We should see through the motives of those in Cairo and Amman and Ramallah and Jeddah, now outraged by Abu Ghraib, who looked away from the terrors of Iraq under the Baathists. Our account is with the Iraqi people: It is their country we liberated, and it is their trust that a few depraved men and women, on the margins of a noble military expedition, have violated. We ought to give the Iraqis the best thing we can do now, reeling as we are under the impact of Abu Ghraib - give them the example of our courts and the transparency of our public life. What we should not be doing is to seek absolution in other Arab lands.  Take this scene from last week, which smacks of the confusion - and panic - of our policies in the aftermath of a cruel April: President Bush apologizing to King Abdullah II of Jordan for the scandal at Abu Ghraib.  Peculiar, that apology - owed to Iraq's people, yet forwarded to Jordan. We are still held captive by Pan-Arab politics. We struck into Iraq to free that country from the curse of the Arabism that played havoc with its politics from its very inception as a nation-state. We had thought, or implied, or let Iraqis think, that a new political order would emerge, that the Pan-Arab vocation that had been Iraq's poison would be no more.  The Arabs had let down Iraq, averted their gaze from the mass graves and the terrors inflicted on Kurdistan and the south, and on the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala and their seminarians and scholars. Jordan in particular had shown no great sensitivity toward Iraq's suffering. This was a dark spot in the record of a Hashemite dynasty otherwise known for its prudence and mercy. It was a concession that the Hashemite court gave to Jordan's 'street,' to the Palestinians in refugee camps and to the swanky districts of Amman alike. Jordan in the 1980s was the one country where Saddam Hussein was a mythic hero: the crowd identified itself with his Pan-Arab dreams, and thrilled to his cruelty and historical revisionism. This is why the late king, Hussein, broke with his American ties - as well as with his fellow Arab monarchs - after the invasion of Kuwait. His son did better in this war; he noted the price that Jordan paid in the intervening decade. He took America's side, and let the crowd know that a price would be paid for riding with Saddam. But no apology was owed to him for Abu Ghraib. He was no more due an apology for what took place than were the rulers in Kathmandu.  But this was of a piece with our broader retreat of late. We have dispatched the way of Iraqis an envoy of the U.N., Lakhdar Brahimi, an Algerian of Pan-Arab orientation, with past service in the League of Arab States. It stood to reason (American reason, uninformed as to the terrible complications of Arab life) that Mr. Brahimi, 'an Arab,' would better understand Iraq's ways than Paul Bremer. But nothing in Mr. Brahimi's curriculum vitae gives him the tools, or the sympathy, to understand the life of Iraq's Shiite seminaries; nothing he did in his years of service in the Arab league exhibited concern for the cruelties visited on the Kurds in the 1980s. Mr. Brahimi hails from the very same political class that has wrecked the Arab world. He has partaken of the ways of that class: populism, anti-Americanism, anti-Zionism, and a preference for the centralized state.  He came from the apex of the Algerian system of power that turned that country into a charnel house, inflicted on it a long-running war between the secular powers-that-be and the Islamists, and a tradition of hostility by the Arab power-holders toward the country's Berbers. No messenger more inappropriate could have been found if the aim was to introduce Iraqis to the ways of pluralism.  Mr. Brahimi owes us no loyalty. His prescription of a 'technocratic government' for Iraq - which the Bush administration embraced only, to retreat from, by latest accounts - is a cunning assault on the independent political life of Iraq. The Algerian seeks to return Iraq to the Pan-Arab councils of power. His entire policy seeks nothing less than a rout of the gains, which the Kurds and the Shiites have secured after the fall of the Tikriti-Baathist edifice. The Shiites have seen through his scheme. A history of disinheritance has given them the knowledge they need to recognize those who bear them ill will. American power may not be obligated - and should not be - to deliver the Shiites a new dominion in Iraq. But we can't once more consign them to the mercy of their enemies in the Arab world. At any rate, it is too late in the hour for such a policy, for the genie is out of the bottle and the Shiites will fight back. Gone is their old timidity and quietism. Their rejection of Mr. Brahimi's diplomacy is now laid out for everyone to see.   For his part, Mr. Brahimi knew that the Americans were eager to dump, and he rightly bet on the innocence (other, less charitable terms could be used) of those in the Bush administration now calling the shots on Iraq. They were unburdened by any deep knowledge of the country, and Mr. Brahimi offered the false promise of pacifying Iraq in the run-up to our presidential elections.  His technocracy is, in truth, but a cover for the restoration of the old edifice of power. Fallujah gave him running room; its fight for a lost, unjust dominion, was his diplomatic tool. His prescription, he let it be known, would calm the tempest in that sullen place. The Marines were fighting to bring that town to order. The Marines were not Mr. Brahimi's people: Their fight, and their sacrifices, he dismissed as a 'collective punishment' of a civilian population. Mr. Brahimi should know a thing or two about collective punishment. His native Algeria has provided enough lessons in what really constitutes the indiscriminate punishment of populations that come in the way of military power.  In the scales of military power, the Arabs have not been brilliant in modern times. But there is cunning aplenty in their world, and an unerring eye for the follies of great foreign powers. The Arabs can read through President Bush's stepping back from his support for Ariel Sharon's plan for withdrawal from Gaza. There are amends to be made for Abu Ghraib, and those are owed the people of Iraq. Yet here we are paying the Palestinians with Iraqi coin. The Palestinians will not be grateful for our concessions; and they are to be forgiven the only conclusion they will draw. Those concessions have already been taken as the compromises of an America now in the throes of self-flagellation.  We can't have this peculiar mix of imperial reach, coupled with such obtuseness. It is odd, and defective in the extreme, that President Bush chose the official daily of the Egyptian regime, Al-Ahram, for yet another interview, another expression of contrition over Abu Ghraib. In the anti-Americanism of Egypt (of Al-Ahram itself), the protestations of our virtue are of no value. In our uncertainty, we now walk into the selective rage of the Egyptians, a popular hostility tethered to the policies of a regime eager to see us fail in Iraq - a regime afraid that the Iraqis may yet steal a march on Egypt into modernity. Cairo has no standing in Iraq.  Why not take representatives of a budding Iraqi publication into the sanctuary of the Oval Office and offer a statement of contrition by our leader?  Our goals in Iraq are being diluted by the day. There has been naivete on our part, to be sure, and no small measure of hubris. We haven't always read Iraq right, but if we abdicate the burden and the responsibility - and the possibilities - that came with this war, our entire effort will come to grief. In Najaf on May 7, in a Friday sermon made from the shrine of Imam Ali - Shiism's most revered pulpit - Sheikh Sadr-al-din Qabanji, a respected cleric with ties to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, called on the Mahdi Army of Muqtada al-Sadr to quit the city. 'Listen to the advice of the ulema,' he said, using the term for the recognized men of religion. 'Come, let us together find another way, and go back to your homes and provinces.' The defense of Najaf, he said, belonged to its people, and the bands of young 'Sadrists' were told to return to the slums of Baghdad. We haven't stilled Iraq's furies, and our gains there have been made with heartbreaking losses.   But in the midst of our anguish over Abu Ghraib, and in our eagerness to placate an Arab world that has managed to convince us of its rage over the scandal, we should stay true to what took us into Iraq, and to the gains that may yet be salvaged.

Or warned with threats as North Korea or Iran - although it was almost listed in President Bush's 'axis of evil' speech.   But finally this week, the hard-line secular regime in Damascus is due for some punishment from an administration long divided over whether Syria deserves more carrot than stick in dealing with its terrorist offenses.  Congress pushed Mr. Bush to act by approving a measure last November calling for sanctions on Syria if it didn't shape up. The move was driven as much by political pressure to help Israel as to protect the US.  But it's clear American patience with Syria's young leader, Bashar al-Assad, has run thin because of his tactical feints in helping the US with post-invasion Iraq, promoting of various terror groups, and toying with weapons of mass destruction. A Washington eager to reform the Middle East can't wait while Mr. Assad plays old games of conspiracy and half-steps, despite having 130,000 US troops next door in Iraq.  The latest Syrian game is to claim that it too is threatened by militant Islamists after a bombing in its capital on April 27. But Bush isn't buying it, and in imposing sanctions this week, he's decided Syria fits the category of being a nation against the US because Syria isn't doing enough to be with it in fighting terror.  He's expected to bar sales of dual-use items that could have military applications, and will likely to restrict US oil investments in Syria as well as Syrian planes flying to or over the US - for starters.  The Western-educated Assad may want to help the US, but he's surrounded by old generals who thrive off the business they've long enjoyed in Lebanon by having 20,000 troops occupy that country. (Syria also allows Iran to use Syrian soil to support the anti-Israel Hizbollah fighters in Lebanon.)  The worst offense is Syria's unwillingness to prevent foreign fighters from entering Iraq across a 400-mile border. It may be calculating that the US is on the run in Iraq and will soon exit. Bush has every reason to send Syria a stern signal of US resolve.

"            HIGHLIGHTS   GeoPolitica - Security   urlLink   Terror manual names Australians    Australians have been named in an al-Qaeda manual as the primary targets for terrorists in Indonesia. em>  The manual, targeting the Cities, specifies which foreign nationals to target in Muslim countries such as Americans in Saudi Arabia, French in Algiers and Australians in Indonesia.   Terrorism expert Clive Williams said the document was significant as it named, for the first time, Australians rather than Westerners in general as the number one target in Indonesia. Mr Williams also said it appeared Australia was increasingly named in al-Qaeda documents as a result of involvement in the war in Iraq.   'The rhetoric and the emphasis has been more on Australians certainly since we got involved in Iraq,' said Mr Williams, director of terrorism studies at Australian National University.   Anti-terrorism agencies monitor large volumes of al-Qaeda material published on the internet.   The 11-page manual by an al-Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz al-Mokrin, ranks Australia fourth on an overall list of 'human targets' behind Americans, British and Spanish and ahead of Canadians and Italians.   The manual also lists groups of people according to their importance as targets. Businessmen, bankers and economists are first, then diplomats, politicians and scholars, thirdly scientists, and experts and then soldiers. Tourists are ranked last.   Mr Williams said the manual was not a fatwa or directive to kill Australians but rather a 'white paper' that terrorists could consider when planning attacks.  'Australia has been mentioned at least half a dozen times by al-Qaeda as a potential target overseas but this is the first time I've seen a reference to Australians in Indonesia, that they should be the target of choice,' Mr Williams said.   'The danger of that, of course, is that Indonesians who are sympathetic to al-Qaeda might therefore think about Australians as being the primary target in Indonesia, which is not what we have been up till now.'   Manager of security analysis at Sydney-based Intelligent Risks, Ian Shaw, said the manual was a concern considering terrorists in Indonesia were still capable of another Marriott-style attack.   A bomb blast at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta last year killed 12 people.   The manual gives instructions about establishing a terrorist cell and communicating with its members without being detected.   'The primary targets should be Jews and Christians who have important status in the Islamic countries,' the manual, obtained by The Australian, says.  'The purpose is not to allow them to settle in the lands of the Moslems. Our advice is to start with unprotected soft targets and the individuals from countries that support the local renegades.'

Michael Formica is repeating himself.   'It's all about low hanging fruit,' said Formica, gesturing toward his PowerPoint presentation. 'Low hanging fruit.'  The commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division is referring to easily achieved tasks that will enlist the support of Iraqis who have come to doubt the Americans' ability to rebuild a peaceful, self-functioning country.    In laying out a summary of a plan to clean up the 21 neighborhoods for which his unit is responsible, Formica rattles through a list of short-term tasks that will create 'instant employment, instant beautification, and instant change in perception.'   The projects include rebuilding a market, renovating a youth center, and refurbishing facilities at a local veterinary college.    Buried amongst the maps and bullet points are colorful slides.   One of them suggests a future still unimaginable for most Iraqis in a neighborhood that now will forever now be associated with the worst of American behavior in Iraq.  The slide shows Abu Ghraib, the neighborhood that houses the notorious prison that has become the focus of the growing abuse scandal that has severly damaged the military's credibility in Iraq.  In this case, the neighborhood - a rough, low-income part of Baghdad teeming with men formerly employed by the Iraqi military industry – is reincarnated as a picturesque suburb with lush green gardens and neat rows of brick houses.  When the presentation is finished, a small, stout Iraqi speaks. In halting English, Dr. Majid Nassir of the Baghdad Veterinary College thanks Formica and his men. But then he adds, 'Before anything, we must work on security.'  Security concerns trump all It's a familiar refrain, one which has plagued the 1st Cavalry Division since it formally assumed control from the 1st Armored Division over Baghdad a little over a month ago.    It was a tough welcome. The fighting in April  - which resulted in scores of American deaths and hundreds of Iraqi casualties - was the worst since the war. Not only did the violence halt rebuilding efforts, it reinforced the growing Iraqi perception that the coalition has yet to accomplish anything.  'The biggest problem is that the coalition's been here over a year, and nothing's changed,' said Col. Kendall Cox, commander of the Engineer Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division.   'So we've set out this low hanging fruit strategy. Find something you can reach up and grab and fix and show the Iraqi people.'    A clean sweep?   The strategy is bound up in 'Operation Iron Broom,' a key part of the unit's mission 'to defeat anti-coalition forces in order to create the infrastructure and economic conditions for the transfer to legitimate Iraqi governance' on June 30.   The $10 million operation was launched in Baghdad in March and encourages local participation in the reconstruction effort.  Some of these projects, modest in size and scope, show initial promise. A new walled market area just opened in Abu Dasher, a district with some of the lowest literacy and employment rates in Baghdad. The new space provides enough room for 150 to 200 stalls and boasts small details such as running clean water to improve sanitary conditions.  'This is the ideal thing we need to do. It's built by Iraqis for Iraqis,' said Cox. 'We're not doing this. We're providing the means and the money for Iraqis to do this.'    As the colonel leaves the market, an elderly Iraqi man who has been guarding the market space approaches him. The man wants a gun to better protect the new facility. But Cox shook his head. 'Right now, we cannot give weapons.'    A new soccer field opened with fanfare recently. Following a ribbon-cutting ceremony, local officials sat under a marqee, passages from the Quran were read out, and two teams kicked off on the new pitch.  But surrounding the field was a seven-foot high fence topped with barbed wire; on opening day, dozens of young Iraqi boys clung to the wire peering through at the U.S. troops standing guard.     Case study:    Kerkh sewage treatments plant other projects better illustrate the challenges of rebuilding basic services in a dangerous environment. The Kerkh Sewage Treatment Plant is one of three designed to protect the Tigris River from raw sewage produced by the city's 5.2 million residents.    But a lack of maintenance, a shortage of spare parts, and extensive looting during the war have rendered the southern Baghdad plant ineffective in processing the wastage generated by two million people.    Since last year, Bechtel, through a contract with USAID, has been responsible for overhauling the plant. But two months ago, when violence flared across Baghdad, two plant workers were killed when their car hit a roadside bomb.    Both Bechtel and local employees immediately stopped going to work until the 1-8 Battalion of the 1st Cavalry showed up to secure the plant premises.

The change in prison procedure comes during a widening scandal into prisoner abuse in Iraq.  Lt. Gen. David Barno said the military had looked into 'challenges and problems' at holding facilities in Afghanistan. He didn't say what the allegations were, or if any of them had proved true.   'One of the things we've done recently is to reduce the amount of time we're allowing local (American) commanders to have people in their temporary facilities before they come to Bagram,' the main U.S. base north of Kabul, Barno said. Barno was responding to a question about reported complaints by former detainees of abuse during the past year at bases including Gardez in eastern Afghanistan and Kandahar, in the south.  He said all complaints were investigated and 'appropriate action' taken as a result.  'I am aware of a number of the allegations out there. We have run a series of investigations on some of the challenges and problems that have been brought up with some of the remote holding facilities,' he said.   The military opened a formal investigation into the deaths of two Afghans at Bagram's closely guarded jail in December 2002, but says it has had trouble-gathering evidence and has yet to release results.  Autopsies found that both men died of blunt force injuries.  A third Afghan died last June at a holding facility in eastern Kunar province. A U.S. intelligence official said last week the CIA inspector general is investigating that death because it involved an independent contractor working for the agency.  Barno said 'a number of very significant changes' were made at Bagram as a result of those deaths, but the military refuses to give details of its prison regime.  'I'm very confident in our procedures there,' he said.  The military insists it is treating its prisoners in Afghanistan humanely, saying Bagram receives regular visits from officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  'I'm very confident in our procedures there,' Barno said.  But human rights groups point to lingering allegations of torture from former prisoners held at a network of secretive American jails across Afghanistan.  The U.S. military views Taliban and al-Qaida prisoners as 'unlawful combatants,' and has held hundreds captured in the 2001 war for more than two years without formal charge or access to lawyers.  It conducted a major review of its Bagram jail again in March, but it is unclear if that review was prompted by the investigation of abuse of prisoners in Iraq.  The military in Afghanistan has refused to comment on findings in an internal Army report that prison guards in Iraq and Afghanistan were told to 'soften up' prisoners so they would be more cooperative in interrogations.

Israel and the United States suspect Iran is secretly building nuclear weapons under cover of a nuclear energy program. In the past, Israel has said it would not allow Iran to build a nuclear bomb.   In 1981, Israeli fighter-bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor that was under construction outside Baghdad because it feared Iraq would acquire a nuclear weapon.   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said last month Iran was a threat to Israel, ``maybe the main existential threat.''   In an interview with state television, Iran's chief negotiator on nuclear affairs, Hasan Rowhani, warned that an Israeli attack would have severe consequences.   ``Israel knows our hands are well equipped,'' Rowhani said. ``If such an incident happens, it will meet a resolute response from our side.''   Rowhani did not explain what he meant by saying Iran was ``well equipped,'' but Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said in December that Iran would strike back with long-range missiles if Israel were to attack its nuclear facilities.   Shamkhani said Iran's Shahab-3 missile, which has a range of about 810 miles, would be one of the weapons used. Israel is about 600 miles west of Iran.   Suspicion of Israel and its agents is pervasive in Iran. On Saturday, Iran's armed forces closed the new Imam Khomeini International Airport on its first day of scheduled flights. Citing security concerns, the armed forces spoke of possible links between Israel and a Turkish company that has a contract to operate the airport. The Turkish company rejected the allegation.     Turkey has military links with Israel.     Iran is building its first nuclear reactor, which is expected to come on stream next year. It has been criticized by the International Atomic Energy Agency for failing to disclose certain aspects of its nuclear program. Iran has promised to cooperate fully with IAEA inspectors and insists its program is for peaceful purposes.

The U.S. government is investigating Chiquita Brands International Inc. for making 'protection' payments to certain Colombian groups, which the U.S. says, are terrorist organizations, the company said Monday.   The announcement came on the same day the Cincinnati-based distributor of bananas and other fresh fruits reported first-quarter net income falling to $20 million, or 46 cents per share, from $25 million, or 62 cents, a year ago.   Chiquita Chief Executive Fernando Aguirre said in a conference call with analysts that the company is taking the investigation 'very seriously, but believe it's manageable.'   'I want to stress that this issue only involves our Colombia subsidiary,' Aguirre said.     The Department of Justice recently indicated it will be evaluating the role and conduct of the company and some of its officers into a matter involving Chiquita's banana subsidiary in Colombia, Chiquita said.   In April 2003, the company's management and audit committee voluntarily disclosed to the Justice Department that its subsidiary had been forced to make 'protection' payments, according to Chiquita.   The payments went to certain groups in Colombia that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations under U.S. law, the company said.   Chiquita said the groups made threats against the company's workers and that it made the payments only to protect its employees.   Chiquita disclosed the matter to the Justice Department when the company learned that supporting such a federally labeled terrorist organization is a criminal act under a U.S. statute, the company said.   It is an open secret in Colombia that companies are occasionally forced to buy off illegal armed groups fighting in the country's four-decade-old war, but Chiquita's admission appeared unprecedented.   Chiquita ships bananas from plants in northern Colombia in areas with a heavy presence of the outlawed far-right United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, which is responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses in recent Colombian history.   Known by its Spanish initials AUC, it has killed thousands of people, mainly peasants, for suspected links to Marxist rebels over the past few years. It also traffics cocaine, according to U.S. officials.   Human rights groups say the AUC worked closely with the army in a push against rebels in the Uraba banana-growing region in the 1990s. The government says any soldiers caught cooperating with the AUC will be prosecuted.   The AUC, now negotiating peace with the government, has targeted unions, which it often accuses of being guerrilla fronts.   A Colombian union is currently trying to sue Coca Cola (KO: Research, Estimates) for the murder of a worker by paramilitaries at a bottling plant in 1996. The soft-drink company says it had nothing to do with the incident.  Banana prices this year fell sharply from the year-earlier period, when flooding in Costa Rica and Panama limited supply.   Net sales for the quarter rose to $793 million from $471 million a year earlier. Atlanta AG, a German fresh produce distributor acquired at the end of March 2003, accounted for $283 million of the increase, Chiquita said.   The remainder resulted from favorable European exchange rates and increased sales of other fresh produce, the company said.   The company said it is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation.   Shares of Chiquita (CQB: Research, Estimates) fell 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.10 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange before the company’s late-day announcement.

In Iraq, the most important prisoners are kept in a huge hangar near the runway at Baghdad International Airport, say U.S. government officials, counterterrorism experts and others. In Qatar, U.S. forces have been ferrying some Iraqi prisoners to a remote jail on the gigantic U.S. air base in the desert.  The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, where a unit of U.S. soldiers abused prisoners, is just the largest and suddenly most notorious in a worldwide constellation of detention centers -- many of them secret and all off-limits to public scrutiny - that the U.S. military and CIA have operated in the name of counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operations since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  These prisons and jails are sometimes as small as shipping containers and as large as the sprawling Guantanamo Bay complex in Cuba. They are part of an elaborate CIA and military infrastructure whose purpose is to hold suspected terrorists or insurgents for interrogation and safe-keeping while avoiding U.S. or international court systems, where proceedings and evidence against the accused would be aired in public.  Some are even held by foreign governments at the informal request of the United States.   'The number of people who have been detained in the Arab world for the sake of America is much more than in Guantanamo Bay. Really, thousands,' said Najeeb Nuaimi, a former justice minister of Qatar who is representing the families of dozens of prisoners.   The largely hidden array includes three systems that only rarely overlap: the Pentagon-run network of prisons, jails and holding facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and elsewhere; small and secret CIA-run facilities where top al Qaeda and other figures are kept; and interrogation rooms of foreign intelligence services – some with documented records of torture - to which the U.S. government delivers or 'renders' mid- or low-level terrorism suspects for questioning.   All told, more than 9,000 people are held by U.S. authorities overseas, according to Pentagon figures and estimates by intelligence experts, the vast majority under military control. The detainees have no conventional legal rights: no access to a lawyer; no chance for an impartial hearing; and at least in the case of prisoners held in cellblock 1A at Abu Ghraib, no apparent guarantee of humane treatment accorded prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions or civilians in U.S. jails.  Although some of those held by the military in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo have had visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross, some of the CIA's detainees have, in effect, disappeared, according to interviews with former and current national security officials and to the Army's report of abuses at Abu Ghraib.  The CIA's 'ghost detainees,' as they were called by members of the 800th MP Brigade, were routinely held by the soldier-guards at Abu Ghraib 'without accounting for them, knowing their identities, or even the reason for their detention,' the report says. These phantom captives were 'moved around within the facility to hide them' from Red Cross teams, a tactic that was 'deceptive, contrary to Army doctrine, and in violation of international law.'  CIA employees are under investigation by the Justice Department and the CIA inspector general's office in connection with the death of three captives in the past six months, two who died while under interrogation in Iraq, and a third who was being questioned by a CIA contract interrogator in Afghanistan. A CIA spokesman said the hiding of detainees was inappropriate. He declined to comment further.  None of the arrangements that permit U.S. personnel to kidnap,transport, interrogate and hold foreigners are ad hoc or unauthorized, including the so-called renditions. 'People tend to regard it as an extra-judicial kidnapping; it's not,' former CIA officer Peter Probst said. 'There is a long history of this. It has been done for decades. It's absolutely legal.'  In fact, every aspect of this new universe - including maintenance of covert airlines to fly prisoners from place to place, interrogation rules and the legal justification for holding foreigners without due process afforded most U.S. citizens - has been developed by military or CIA lawyers, vetted by Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel and, depending on the particular issue, approved by White House General Counsel's Office or the president himself.  In some cases, such as determining whether a U.S. citizen should be designated an enemy combatant who can be held without charges, the president makes the final decision, said Alberto R. Gonzales, counsel to the president, in a Feb. 24 speech to the American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security.  Critics of this kind of detention and treatment, Gonzales said, 'assumed that there was little or no analysis - legal or otherwise - behind the decision to detain a particular person as enemy combatant.'  On the contrary, the administration has applied the law of war, he said. 'Under these rules, captured enemy combatants, whether soldiers or saboteurs, may be detained for the duration of hostilities.'  Because most of the directives and guidelines on these issues are classified, former and current military and intelligence officials who described them to The Washington Post would do so only on the condition that they not be named.  Along with other CIA and military efforts to disrupt terrorist plots and break up al Qaeda's financial networks, administration officials argue that the interrogations are a key component of their global counterterrorism strategy and counterinsurgency operations in Iraq. As the CIA's deputy director, John McLaughlin, recently told the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks: 'The country, with all its capabilities, is now much more orchestrated into an offensive mix that is relentless.'    Military jails and prisons   Abu Ghraib prison - where photographs were taken that have enraged the Arab world and rocked U.S. political and military leadership - held 6,000 to 7,000 detainees at the time of the documented abuse. Today, it and other sites in Iraq hold more than 8,000 prisoners, U.S. and coalition officials said. They range from those believed to have played key roles in the insurgency to some who are held on suspicion of petty crimes.  Until the current scandal cast some hazy light, little has been publicly known about the Iraqi detention sites, their locations and who was being held there. That has been a source of continuing frustration for international monitoring groups such as New York-based Human Rights Watch, which has repeatedly sought to visit the facilities. Even the military's investigative report on abuses at Abu Ghraib remains classified, despite having become public through leaks.  Far better known has been the Defense Department's facility at Guantanamo Bay. The open-air camps there house about 600 detainees, flown in from around the world over the past two years. Secrecy there remains tight, with detainees and most of the facilities off-limits to visitors.  The U.S. Supreme Court is deciding whether detainees held there, whom the Pentagon has declared 'enemy combatants' in the war against terrorism, should have access to U.S. courts.  Last week, the U.S. military acknowledged that two Guantanamo Bay guards had been disciplined in connection with use of excessive force against detainees. And U.S. defense officials confirmed the existence of a list of approved interrogation techniques, dating to April 2003, that included reversing sleep patterns, exposing prisoners to hot and cold, and 'sensory assault,' including use of bright lights and loud music.  The treatment of prisoners in Afghanistan has received less public attention.  The U.S. military holds 300 or so people at Bagram, north of the capital of Kabul, and in Kandahar, Jalalabad and Asadabad. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 700 people had been released from those sites, most of them held a few weeks or less. Special Forces units also have holding centers at their firebases, including at Gardez and Khost.   In December 2002, two Afghans died in U.S. custody in Afghanistan. The U.S. military classified both as homicides. Another Afghan died in June 2003 at a detention site near Asadabad.  'Afghans detained at Bagram airbase in 2002 have described being held in detention for weeks, continuously shackled, intentionally kept awake for extended periods of time, and forced to kneel or stand in painful positions for extended periods,' according to a report in March by Human Rights Watch. 'Some say they were kicked and beaten when arrested, or later as part of efforts to keep them awake. Some say they were doused with freezing water in the winter.'    CIA detention   Before the U.S. military was imprisoning and interrogating people in Afghanistan and Iraq, the CIA was scooping up suspected al Qaeda leaders in such far-off places as Pakistan, Yemen and Sudan. Today, the CIA probably holds two to three dozen captives around the world, according to knowledgeable current and former officials. Among them are al Qaeda leaders Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh in Pakistan and Abu Zubaida. The CIA is also in charge of interrogating Saddam Hussein, who is believed to be in Baghdad.  The location of CIA interrogation centers is so sensitive that even the four leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, who are briefed on all covert operations, do not know them, congressional sources said. These members are given periodic reports about the captives, but several members said they do not receive information about conditions under which prisoners are held, and members have not insisted on this information. The CIA has told Congress that it does not engage in torture as a tactic of interrogation.  'There's a black hole on certain information such as location, condition under which they are held,' said one congressional official who asked not to be named. 'They are told it's too sensitive.'  In Afghanistan, the CIA used to conduct some interrogations in a cluster of metal shipping containers on Bagram air base protected by three layers of concertina wire. It is unclear whether that center is still open, but the CIA's main interrogation center now appears to be in Kabul, at a location nicknamed 'The Pit' by agency and Special Forces operators.   'Prisoner abuse is nothing new,' said one military officer who has been working closely with CIA interrogators in Afghanistan. A dozen former and current national security officials interviewed by The Washington Post in 2002, including several who had witnessed interrogations, defended the use of stressful interrogation tactics and the use of violence against detainees as just and necessary.   The CIA general counsel's office developed a new set of interrogation rules of engagement in after the Sept. 11 attacks. It was vetted by the Justice Department and approved by the National Security Council's general counsel, according to U.S. intelligence officials and other U.S. officials familiar with the process. 'There are very specific guidelines that are thoroughly vetted,' said one U.S. official who helps oversee the process. 'Everyone is on board. It's legal.'  The rules call for field operators to seek approval from Washington to use 'enhanced measures,' methods that could cause temporary physical or mental pain.  U.S. intelligence officials say the CIA, contrary to the glamorized view from movies and novels, had no real interrogation specialists on hand to deal with the number of valuable suspects it captured after Sept. 11. The agency relied on analysts, psychologists and profilers. 'Two and a half years later,' one CIA veteran said, 'we have put together a very professional, controlled, deliberate and legally rationalized approach to dealing with the Abu Zubaidas of the world.'  U.S. intelligence officials say their strongest suit is not harsh interrogation techniques, but time and patience.     'Renditions'   Much larger than the group of prisoners held by the CIA are those who have been captured and transported around the world by the CIA and other agencies of the U.S. government for interrogation by foreign intelligence services. This transnational transfer of people is a key tactic in U.S. counterterrorism operations on five continents, one that often raises the ire of foreign publics when individual cases come to light.  For example, on Jan. 17, 2000, a few hours before Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber was to order the release of five Algerians and a Yemeni for lack of evidence, Bosnian police handed them over to U.S. authorities who flew them to Guantanamo Bay.  The Bosnian government, faced with public outcry, said it would compensate the families of the men, who were suspected of having made threats to the U.S. and British embassies in Bosnia.  The same month, in Indonesia, Muhammad Saad Iqbal Madni, suspected of helping Richard C. Reid, the Briton charged with trying to detonate explosives in his shoe on an American Airlines flight, was detained by Indonesian intelligence agents based on information the CIA provided them. On Jan. 11, without a court hearing or a lawyer, he was hustled aboard an unmarked U.S.-registered Gulfstream V jet parked at a military airport in Jakarta and flown to Egypt.  It was no coincidence Madni ended up in Egypt. Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are well-known destinations for suspected terrorists.  'A lot of people they [the U.S.] are taking to Jordan, third-country nationals,' a senior Saudi official said. 'They can do anything they want with them, and the U.S. can say, 'We don't have them.' '  In the past year, an unusual country joined that list of destinations: Syria.  Last year U.S. immigration authorities, with the approval of then-Acting Attorney General Larry Thompson, authorized the expedited removal of Maher Arar to Syria, a country the U.S. government has long condemned as a chronic human-rights abuser. Maher, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, was detained at JFK International Airport in New York as he was transferring to the final leg of his flight home to Canada.  U.S. authorities say Arar has links to al Qaeda. Not wanting to return him to Canada for fear he would not be adequately followed, immigration officials took him, in chains and shackles, to a New Jersey airfield, where he was 'placed on a small private jet, and flown to Washington D.C.,' according to a lawsuit filed recently against the U.S. government. He was flown to Jordan, interrogated and beaten by Jordanian authorities who then turned him over to Syria, according to the lawsuit.  Arar said that for the 10 months he was in prison, he was beaten, tortured and kept in a shallow grave. After much pressure from the Canadian government and human rights activists, he was freed and has returned to Canada.  CIA Director George J. Tenet, testifying earlier this year before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks, said the agency participated in more than 70 renditions in the years before the attacks. In 1999 and 2000 alone, congressional testimony shows, the CIA and FBI participated in two dozen renditions.  Christopher Kojm, a former State Department intelligence official and a staff member of the commission, explained the rendition procedure at a recent hearing: 'If a terrorist suspect is outside of the United States, the CIA helps to catch and send him to the United States or a third country,' he testified. 'Though the FBI is often part of the process, the CIA is usually the main player, building and defining the relationships with the foreign government intelligence agencies and internal security services.'  The Saudis currently are detaining and interrogating about 800 terrorism suspects, said a senior Saudi official. Their fate is largely controlled by Saudi-based joint intelligence task forces, whose members include officers from the CIA, FBI and other U.S. law-enforcement agencies.  The Saudi official said his country does not participate in renditions and today holds no more than one or two people at the request of the United States. Yet much can hinge on terminology.  In some interrogations, for example, specialists from the United States and Saudi Arabia develop questions and an interrogation strategy before questioning begins, according to one person knowledgeable about the process. During interrogation, U.S. task force members watch through a two-way mirror, he said.  'Technically, the questioning is done by a Saudi citizen. But, for all practical purposes, it is done live,' he said. The United States and Saudis 'are not 'cooperating' anymore; we're doing it together.'  He said the CIA sometimes prefers Saudi interrogation sites and other places in the Arab world because their interrogators speak a detainee's language and can exploit his religion and customs.  'As hard as it is to believe, you can't physically abuse prisoners in Saudi Arabia,' the Saudi official said. 'You can't beat them; you can't electrocute them.'  Instead, he said, the Saudis bring radical imams to the sessions to build a rapport with detainees, who are later passed on to more moderate imams. Working in tandem with relatives of the detainees, the clerics try to convince the subjects over days or weeks that terrorism violates tenets of the Koran and could bar them from heaven.  'According to our guys, almost all of them turn,' the Saudi official, said. 'It's like deprogramming them. There is absolutely no need to put them through stress. It's more of a therapy.'  The Saudis don't want or need to be directed by American intelligence specialists, who have difficulty understanding Arab culture and tribal relations, he said. 'We know where they grew up,' he said of the detainees. 'We know their families. We know the furniture in their home.'   Research editor  Margot Williams  contributed to this report.

But the settlement doesn't really do that - other WorldCom litigation is still pending - and it shouldn't, as the deal is part of Wall Street's reckoning of recent wrongs, which is ongoing.   The size of the payout is staggering not because it is the second-largest class action settlement in history, but because it dwarfs the $1.4 billion settlement agreed to by Citigroup's (nyse: C) Salomon unit and the rest of Wall Street last year.   That settlement, which concerned conflicts of interest by stock analysts, now seems like a down payment. Wall Street still faces analyst-related litigation and lawsuits about the spinning and laddering of IPO shares.  These actions fester despite some of the cases against Henry Blodget and Merrill Lynch (nyse: MER) being dismissed and despite Credit Suisse Group's (nyse: CSR) settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission concerning IPO allocations. Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase (nyse: JPM) and other big banks have settled some Enron-related cases, but more are outstanding.    Citigroup has been denying wrongdoing in relation to WorldCom for a while now, and it admitted no wrongdoing yesterday. It denied that its star telecom analyst Jack Grubman was conflicted by his relationship with former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers and his closeness to WorldCom. Citigroup denied it could have known about accounting fraud at WorldCom despite its close relationship with the company. It denied that its then-CEO Sandy Weill did anything wrong when he lobbied Grubman to change one of his ratings on AT&T (nyse: T). It denied that it did anything wrong when it doled out shares of other companies' IPOs to WorldCom executives.   Yesterday, Citigroup's current CEO Charles Prince took the opportunity of the bank agreeing to pay the $2.65 billion to praise Weill for his leadership in reforming Citigroup. But if Weill is to be so praised, shouldn't he have first been denounced for presiding over the structures that led to the conflicts of interest and the litigation in the first place?  That's not how it works, of course. This type of incentive system mirrors that in corporate America in general. Weill is a prime example. In 2000 alone, he cashed in stock options worth $196.2 million on top of a bonus of $18.4 million. Of course, as is often said, those stock options would not have been worth so much had the value of Citigroup shares not increased.   But soon after, the price of the bank's shares started to fall (along with the market in general). Weill was not called on to pay anything back. Unlike Grubman, he was never fined nor censured.   Now the system is, in a way, working in reverse. Citigroup will pay out far more than it ever earned directly from investment banking fees from WorldCom. What once looked like a world of big rewards and no risk is now all risk and no reward. Not for those who were involved, but for those who own Citigroup shares today.

"            HIGHLIGHTS    Security – U.S.A.    Even With Hindsight Liberals Can't See Straight  Over in the alternative universe of the 9/11 commission hearings watched only by me, Richard Ben-Veniste recently proposed an amazing new standard for investigating Arabs in this country. In the middle of haranguing Condoleezza Rice, Ben-Veniste demanded to know why the suspected 20th hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, had not been more aggressively investigated, despite the fact that - I quote - he had 'no explanation for the funds in his bank account, and no explanation for why he was in the United States.'   So let me get this straight: Airport security can't acknowledge that a person is an Arab, but they should be allowed to audit his bank records? (Come to think of it, 'Can't Explain His Bank Account or Why He's Here' is also a pretty good description of John Kerry.)    Can we use that as a standard going forward? The government prohibits airlines from searching more than two Arabs per flight, so it would be terrific if liberals would let us examine their bank accounts. If Democratic Party shills like Ben-Veniste - who himself looks like someone who ought to be searched at airports - are going to make ludicrous, macho statements like that in order to win applause from weeping widows in the peanut gallery, can't we hold them to that policy when it matters?   Ben-Veniste thinks the key to stopping the 9/11 attack was for the FBI to have drawn the obvious conclusions from an Arab in flight school. If only the FBI had searched Moussaoui's computer, they would have found a flight-simulator computer program, information about the Boeing 747, and extensive files on crop dusters. From this, apparently, Ben-Veniste imagines the FBI would have drawn the obvious conclusion that on Sept. 11, 19 Muslims were going to hijack airplanes out of Logan, Newark and Dulles airports and fly them into buildings.   A somewhat more direct chain of causation traces its way back to the aviation-security commission chaired by Vice President Al Gore in 1997. If that commission had done its job, you wouldn't have to wait for one of my columns to find out that there was a commission on airline safety years before the 9/11 attacks. Isn't it curious that Democrats aren't bragging about Gore inventing air safety? The reason Al Gore hasn't added 'anti-terrorism' to the list of things he invented is that Gore's commission concluded that passenger profiling must ignore ethnicity and nationality. Or as Gore himself might have put it, 'I took the initiative in making it easier for Muslims to use airplanes to slaughter innocent American citizens.'   The Gore commission on air safety decided that profiling should be based on 'reasonable predictors of risk, not stereotypes or generalizations.' Amazingly, all those 'reasonable predictors of risk' failed to stop a single Muslim terrorist on 9/11. One wonders whether a profiling system that included ethnicity and nationality would have been more helpful in stopping 19 Muslim men, 15 of whom were from Saudi Arabia, all speaking Arabic to one another, from boarding planes on Sept. 11.   Recently - i.e., about the time Ben-Veniste was shocked that the FBI hadn't uncovered the 9/11 plot based on the fact that Moussaoui had overstayed his visa - Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer were clamoring for the release of Ansar Mahmood, a 26-year-old Pakistani immigrant detained in October 2001 after he was observed taking photographs at a water treatment plant in upstate New York. Mahmood later pleaded guilty to committing a felony by giving financial aid to illegal immigrants from Pakistan. Schumer says Mahmood should be permitted to stay in the U.S. because he 'was cleared of terrorist links,' and he has already served his time for 'a non-violent felony.' Hillary simply calls Mahmood's detention 'disturbing.'  Where is Ben-Veniste when we need him? What happened to the 'We Don't Know Why He's Here or His Sources of Money' standard for harassing Muslim immigrants? In contrast to Mahmood, Zacarias Moussaoui had committed no felonies; his only apparent offense was to have overstayed his visa. But Ben-Veniste is appalled that the FBI didn't beat Moussaoui for information.   The French had linked Moussaoui to al-Qaida - based largely on the information that he took frequent trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Mahmood's home country. When FBI agents in Minneapolis requested a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer, FBI headquarters wrote back, 'We don't know he's a terrorist' - i.e., the argument Schumer is making for Mahmood's release right now.   Liberals always claim to know exactly what to do as soon as it's too late. After Muslims attack with airplanes, they want to investigate flight schools. After Muslims attack with shoe-bombs, they want to investigate shoes. After a Muslim introduces E. coli into New York's water supply, liberals will be enraged that Muslim immigrants taking pictures of New York water treatment plants weren't investigated more aggressively - as soon as they are done blaming Bush for not stopping the attack amid their caterwauling about the detention of Muslim immigrants. Liberals are the only known species whose powers of reasoning are not improved by the benefit of hindsight. Not only are they always fighting the last war, in most cases they're surrendering.

Fears of possible sabotage attacks on oil facilities in the Middle East also helped to keep prices strong. U.S. light crude hit a high of $39.97 a barrel, before easing to trade 27 cents lower at $39.30 a barrel, while London Brent fell 21 cents to $36.51, down from a high of $37.20, which was the highest level since October 1990. U.S. gasoline futures also eased slightly after hitting another record level of $1.3290 a gallon.   Despite the profit-taking dip, analysts predicted $40-a-barrel oil was still imminent.   'I think we're going to have a four in front of the oil price very soon. It's certainly pretty ugly for the oil consumers of the world,' said David Thurtell, commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. Middle East supply security concerns, low U.S. gasoline stocks and rampant demand growth in China have driven U.S. crude prices toward the record $41.15 hit in October 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the crisis that led to the Gulf War.   'Terrorism fears are causing a permanent risk premium to be built into the market,' said independent energy consultant Geoff Pyne.   Traders worry that weekend shootings at a Saudi Arabian petrochemicals plant and attempts a week earlier to bomb Iraq's key Basra oil export terminal might be precursors to a bigger attack on vital oil facilities in the Middle East, which pumps about one-third of global daily crude output.  Tetsu Emori, chief commodities strategist at Mitsui Bussan Futures in Tokyo, forecast that crude was likely to push up to $43-$45 a barrel by mid-year.  'Last year we hit $39.99 before the war, which was largely psychological. Now we need to look at the fundamentals and they are very strong,' Emori said. Prices spiked close to $40 during intraday trading in February 2003 as U.S.-led forces prepared to attack Iraq.   Summer U.S. gasoline consumption is at the cutting edge of rising consumption. U.S. refineries are struggling to meet demand that in the past four weeks rose 3.4 percent versus the same period last year to 9.1 million barrels a day, suppressing stocks of the motor fuel well below the five-year seasonal average.   The United States, with less than five percent of the world's population, accounts for some 45 percent of the world's gasoline consumption of just over 20 million barrels daily, U.S. government figures show. While U.S. motorists are paying a record $1.84 a gallon, retail prices are only a third of average western European levels and have had no impact on demand.

He decried Disney’s decision not to distribute the film as politically motivate censorship.  However, Moore was crying wolf. He admitted in a CNN interview that he knew a year ago that Disney would not distribute the film, according to a report from independent.co.uk.    Moore told CNN, 'Almost a year ago, after we'd started making the film, the chairman of Disney, Michael Eisner, told my agent he was upset Miramax had made the film and he will not distribute it.'   The lightning rod film producer claims that he had a contract with Disney for distribution, but according to independent.co.uk, a source close to Miramax (the subsidiary involved in the film) said that the deal was for financing, not for distribution.    Moore’s admission prompts the question, why all the outrage now? Easy answer? Publicity baby! The film is set to premier at the Cannes Film Festival later this month. The politically charged film can easily generate controversy and press on it’s own. It is reportedly an attack film against the Bush administration that questions the President’s handling of the War on Terror and the events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. According to some news outlets, the film even attempts to link the Bush family with the family of Osama Bin Laden, in pure Michael Moore style.     This publicity stunt may backfire. If Moore will take a year old event and use it to drum up publicity, it might lead to questions regarding the credibility of some of the issues covered in his film and the spin Moore puts on them.

Bush term if the President wins re-election in November. In classic Powell style, he does not deliver the message in person. Instead, confidants, notably his deputy Richard Armitage and his chief of staff Larry Wilkerson, have made his feelings plain in a lengthy article in the magazine  urlLink GQ , clearly with the Secretary of State's blessing.   …Mr. Wilkerson tells GQ that in his opinion, Gen. Powell is 'tired. Mentally and physically. And if the President were to ask him to stay on, he might for a transitional period but I don't think he'd want to do another four years.' Gen Powell's sole on-the-record comment to GQ on his intentions is a bald 'I never speculate on that'. But the article will fuel uncertainty about the Cabinet's shape in a second Bush administration. Changes are likely at the Pentagon. The most widely mentioned possible successors at the State Department include Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser, and Paul Bremer, the outgoing head of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad. The Powell who emerges from the interview is similar to the figure in journalist Bob Woodward's recent insider account of the run-up to the Iraq War (of which he sxeerms to have been a prime, but as usual unquoted, source). He comes across as a pragmatic secretary of state exhausted by constant battles with the neo-conservative hawks at the Pentagon and in the vice-President's office, in which, over Iraq at least, he is generally on the losing end. Equally plain is the Secretary of State's disdain for the so-called 'chickenhawks,' in Mr Wilkerson's words, 'people who have never been in the face of battle, who are making cavalier decisions about sending men and women out to die.' The chief of staff mentions by name Richard Perle, the former close adviser to the Pentagon, and Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy Secretary of Defense. 'I call them utopians.. I don't care whether utopians are Vladimir Lenin in a sealed train or Paul Wolfowitz. You're never going to bring utopia and you're going to hurt a lot of people in the process of trying to do it.'Gen. Powell also appears to be haunted by the moment that is the nadir of his tenure, his presentation to the United Nations Security Council in February 2003, offering 'proof' of Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction. It's a source of great distress to the Secretary; Mr. Armitage told GQ.Mr Wilkerson evokes the atmosphere in the CIA meeting room in the days before the UN speech, when Gen. Powell and his aides worked around the clock to try and make a credible WMD case against Iraq, scouring the evidence for material that would save the Secretary of  State from humiliation. Harlan Ullman of the National War College, and friend and mentor of Gen Powell, confirms another open secret in Washington, of the Secretary's glacial relations with Dick Cheney, the vice-President. 'I can tell you firsthand that there is a tremendous barrier between Cheney and Powell,' Mr Ullman told the magazine. Assuming he does leave, Gen. Powell's future is unclear. At 67, he is in the closing stages of his career. There have been suggestions he might become the next President of the World Bank, a post traditionally held by an American. This assumes that John Wolfensohn, a Clinton era appointee, steps down later this year after eight years. But Gen. Powell might not be inclined to take a job that carries little clout with the current Republican administration, prone to see the Bank as an emanation of the ever suspect United Nations.

At the same time the organization regrets that the government has failed to take this opportunity to fully acknowledge the crisis in mental health care services, one of the most tragic human rights issues facing Romania today. Amnesty International also regrets the government's failure to engage in a constructive dialogue with the organization and the Romanian civil society, as a first step to remedying the situation.  In the last 15 years, successive Romanian governments failed to recognize the gravity of the situation in mental health care services and to introduce the required comprehensive and effective reforms. Without recognizing the true dimensions and all aspects of the problem it is impossible to expect that a tragic situation which concerns thousands of human beings held in psychiatric institutions in deplorable conditions is addressed urgently and appropriately and in line with all of Romania's obligations under international human rights treaties. The government is not simply in violation of international and domestic law. In light of the human suffering, which takes place in these institutions, recognized by most Romanians who are well informed about this situation, the morality of a position that denies reality is highly questionable.  Amnesty International would also like to reply to specific points raised in the government's press release. The reply notes that currently Romania is unable to provide mental health services which are like those available in the West. Nevertheless, the Romanian authorities, according to the statement, have taken required measures to ensure the respect of basic rights and elemental needs of people who had been subjected to in-patient psychiatric treatment.  In light of numerous violations documented in our memorandum, based primarily on information collected in the field by Amnesty International's delegate, the organization would appreciate to receive specific information regarding the above-mentioned government measures. We would particularly like to receive information on existing standards regarding living conditions, diet, heating and hygiene, which are in force for institutions under the control of the Ministry of Health; as well as information about institutional methods to ensure that such standards are complied with in all facilities providing inpatient services.  It is also alleged that not all of the information presented in Amnesty International's memorandum is true, giving as an example the fact that representatives of the Ministry of Health and public prosecutors periodically visit medical facilities, including those where patients are subjected to involuntary psychiatric treatment.  No statement to the contrary was made in Amnesty International's memorandum. In fact, the memorandum did not specifically reflect on the government's obligation to supervise psychiatric hospitals. This is an opportunity then to put on record Amnesty International's observation regarding this issue: the organization's field research established that the government's supervision of the psychiatric hospitals is insufficient and in breach of international standards (1). For example, in a number of instances, hospital directors were unable to produce for Amnesty International's delegate copies of reports of any recent inspection visits. Presumably, such documents would arise following an inspection by the Ministry's representatives, and would contain their observations, any recommendations made and advice on terms and methods of their implementation.  Furthermore, Amnesty International is concerned to note in the Government's statement that the inspections, so far, have not brought to light any irregularities with regard to the placement of people for involuntary psychiatric treatment and that a list of patients' rights is prominently posted in the visited facilities. Such lists were not observed in locked words visited by Amnesty International's delegate where interviewed patients had been subjected to treatment without being given the opportunity to effectively challenge this decision as provided in the Mental Health Act (2). Moreover, Amnesty International is aware of the public prosecutor's duty to periodically visit hospitals, which care for people who are deemed criminally irresponsible under the provisions of the Penal Code. In that respect it is interesting to note that a senior prosecutor who participated in a debate concerning conditions in psychiatric hospitals organized in Bucharest in late March 2004 by the Group for Social Dialogue, reportedly stated that the living conditions in Poiana Mare were considerably worse than in any prison and that placement for involuntary treatment in this hospital amounts to 'being sentenced to death'.  The government's statement also challenges Amnesty International's observation that the Mental Health Act is not being implemented because the government had failed to adopt regulations for its implementation.  Almost all of the directors of the hospitals visited and medical and legal specialists who had been consulted in Romania by Amnesty International's delegate, including a member of the team of experts who participated in the drafting of the law, stated unequivocally that the Act is not directly applicable. An exception, as stated in Amnesty International's memorandum, was only noted in a hospital in Bihor County but this effort, although well intentioned, did not appear to provide all the required legal safeguards to the patients concerned. Amnesty International would welcome to receive detailed information about the direct implementation of the law and specific instances in which decisions have been challenged before judicial bodies, noting that any such practice may only be sporadic and inconsistently applied. The very fact that this is not a practice that is systematically ensured throughout the country indicates its arbitrary nature and is in violation of international law.  With regard to the so-called 'social cases' - people who had been placed in psychiatric hospitals on non-medical grounds, including those who had formerly been cared for in children's institutions - the government's statement claims that such cases are not numerous and result from the situation which prevailed in the country before the changes in 1989.  Amnesty International would like to receive more information from the Romanian government regarding the basis for this assessment of the situation. On 5 May 2004, a day following the publication of the Government's statement, the State Secretary in the Ministry of Health, according to a report published the same day by BBC-Romanian Service, could not provide journalists at a press conference with any figures concerning the number of people who are held in psychiatric hospitals on non-medical grounds. However, he gave an example of the psychiatric hospital in Jebel where 60 residents, out of a total of 414, were 'social cases'. In one of the hospitals visited by Amnesty International's representative, according to the director, 40-50 residents, none of whom need psychiatric treatment, out of a total of 450 in this institution, had been transferred there from a near-by orphanage. In the medical-social centre of the Nucet Psychiatric hospital which has about 95 residents, most of whom had previously been in orphanages, in February 2004, when Amnesty International's delegate visited the hospital, the latest resident from an orphanage had arrived on 1 December 2003.  Amnesty International is concerned to note that the Government considers its description of the situation in 'Socola' Psychiatric University Hospital in Iasi as erroneous. In support of this claim it is noted that 'the management of this hospital had confirmed that Amnesty International's experts did not visit this facility in May 2003'. Furthermore, the government stated that the registry of received funds by the hospital in the indicated period showed that the hospital was not in a difficult situation and that its activities were carried out in normal conditions.  In the organization's memorandum there is a clear designation of institutions visited by its representative as well as the date of the visits. Amnesty International has made no claim to have visited the hospital in Iasi and had described its situation based on a report in a national daily newspaper. This information, to our best knowledge, had not been refuted at the time by the hospital or other authorities involved (4). In fact the same article quoted Dr Stefan Georgescu, Chief of Iasi Directorate for Public Health, who reportedly stated: 'Because of the debts that exist in the system 'Socola' hospital has problems in obtaining supplies. Psychiatry is seriously underfunded. For example, Intensive Care Therapy is allocated several million lei per day while for a bed in psychiatry we receive only 300.000 lei. We cannot manage on such modest sums.'(5)  The government statement further notes that the budget of the Ministry of Health provides not only for conventional therapies but also for other appropriate therapies.  Amnesty International has noted the inadequacy of some forms of therapy, such as pharmacotherapy, and the absence of a wide range of other therapies in practically all of the institutions visited. We would be interested to receive specific information regarding the volume of such funds and its precise allocation to psychiatric hospitals in 2003. The organization is concerned that the Government is failing to acknowledge what every psychiatrist who had been interviewed by Amnesty International's delegate had stated: that allocated resources even for pharmacotherapy were grossly insufficient and that they feared further cuts. Some doctors were forced to resort to collecting donations from the staff in order to purchase the required medication, while others relied on gifts and aid from their foreign colleagues.  Similarly, Amnesty International's findings do not correspond with the government's observations regarding methods of restraint and seclusion or that patients are provided with all the information in appropriate circumstances to be able to exercise their right to free and informed consent.  Finally, with regard to the cases described in the memorandum, concerning patients who died following an assault by another patient, Amnesty International concurred with the observations of competent authorities, which issued statements at the time that understaffing was a major contributing factor to the reported tragic events.  Amnesty International welcomes the government's statement that it will thoroughly investigate the violations of human rights described in the organization's memorandum. We also welcome a statement of 5 May 2004 by the Ministry of Health as a positive first step to improve the situation in psychiatric facilities for which it is responsible. At the same time, Amnesty International would like to reiterate its appeal to the Romanian government to fully implement all the recommendations made in the organization's memorandum. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  (1)  See Principle 22 of the UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care which states that: 'States shall ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in force to promote compliance with the present principles, for the inspection of mental health facilities, for the submission, investigation and resolution of complaints and for the institution of appropriate disciplinary or judicial proceedings for professional misconduct or violation of the rights of a patient'.

The two communities, while both Iraqi, have diverging interests on a number of issues due to the history of their religious differences. For a variety of reasons, Washington decided that its interests would be best served by tipping the balance of power between these two groups in favor of Shi'a interests.    - Washington's Motivations Behind Supporting Iraqi Shi'a    Shi'a Arabs are the majority cultural group in Iraq, composing about 60 percent of the population. Since the Shi'a are a majority, their support is absolutely critical in order to keep a general level of stability in the country.  Furthermore, before the start of the invasion, Washington policymakers believed the Shi'a population to be an easy group to win the 'hearts and minds' of. The Shi'a community was harshly repressed under Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist government and were occasionally the recipients of brutal crackdowns due to their open resistance to Baghdad's rule, as was seen in the wake up Operation Desert Storm in 1991 when Iraqi troops loyal to Saddam forcefully quelled a Shi'a uprising that began due to the power vacuum created after the retreat of the Iraqi military from Kuwait, and also due to the first Bush administration's call for them to rise up.  Additionally, there was also the effort by Washington policymakers to marginalize Iraq's Sunni Arab population since they were the traditional power base behind the Ba'ath Party. Often the recipients of special favors by Saddam's government in Baghdad, Iraq's Sunni Arab population was more privileged than the country's other major cultural groups, such as Sunni Kurds and Shi'a Arabs. For these reasons, the Bush administration decided that its best course of action would be to push this population off to the sidelines and deal with the victims of the Ba'ath Party's brutality since it would be likely that they would be more open to supporting the U.S. and therefore more beholden to U.S. interests.  Therefore, shortly after the invasion, it is likely that the guerrilla movement in Iraq was exactly as Washington claimed: disenfranchised Sunni Arab militants who were taking up arms against U.S.-led forces. Yet as the occupation continued on, and Washington was unable to achieve relative stability in the country, it became clear that it was not only Sunni Arabs that were taking up arms against U.S.-led forces. This development was evident by the various tapes sent to Arab news networks, such as al-Jazeera, by Iraqi insurgents; in the videos, various militants expressed their hatred for Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party in addition to their hatred for the U.S.-led coalition.  As the occupation proceeded, and the level of stability in Iraq did not improve, the insurgency became more and more diversified, as attacks were launched against U.S.-led troops, Kurds in the north, Sunni Arabs, and Shi'a Arabs. During this time, various groups in Iraq were taking advantage of the power vacuum created after the fall of Saddam to weaken the power base of their enemies or ideological opponents -- indeed, not only is it possible that Sunni and Shi'a Arabs were killing each other, but, as the U.S. alleges, Shi'a leaders may have been assassinating other Shi'a leaders.    - Fallout with the Shi'a    This state of affairs continued for months, with the Shi'a community largely remaining docile in the hopes that true democracy in Iraq would be achieved, thus guaranteeing their ascension as the majority powerbrokers in any new government. Washington, worried over the possibility of too much Shi'a control, began to backtrack slightly on its promise of national elections, and attempted to work certain balancing constraints into the interim constitution. These constraints attempted to equalize the power between Sunni Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shi'a Arabs.  Angered by the change in U.S. policy, Shi'a leaders began to become more outspoken toward the U.S.-led coalition, with both more radical leaders, such as Moqtada al-Sadr, and more moderate leaders, such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, speaking with a unified voice over their disapproval of Washington's plans.  This increasing anger caused the Shi'a community to move away from outspoken support of U.S. policies, and also paved the way for more radical Shi'a leaders such as al-Sadr to increase the size of their following. Al-Sadr, whose power rests upon his Mehdi Army, a private militia containing thousands of fighters, heightened his rhetoric against the U.S.-led coalition to the point that Washington policymakers decided to punish him, closing down his al-Hawza newspaper and arresting one of his top deputies on a murder charge.  Al-Sadr's rebellion, which may have initially been supported by a small minority of Shi'a, had a unifying effect upon the Shi'a community, as Washington's open confrontation with Mehdi fighters put Iraqis in the position of either supporting one side or the other. As in all cases of occupation, the local population generally always supports those that share their culture and history over foreign occupiers, no matter either side's ultimate intentions. Indeed, this was partly the reason why other more moderate Shi'a leaders, such as al-Sistani, have been careful to criticize al-Sadr and have, in effect, offered him safe haven in Najaf.    - More Balance Needed    After witnessing the explosive power of the Shi'a community, Washington policymakers came to the understanding that they would not be able to revive Iraq through the support of Shi'a Arabs and Kurds alone; Iraq's Sunni Arab population would have to be better incorporated into the government. Faced with an insurgency encompassing both Shi'a and Sunni Arabs, Washington has now attempted to remove some of the grievances behind the insurgency.  Also, because Iraq's Sunni Arab population was favored by Saddam, they were often the most educated and skilled Iraqis, a reality that has hurt Washington since it has excluded these pertinent individuals from government and societal affairs. Recognizing their mistake, Washington has now reversed its de-Ba'athification policy and is actively reincorporating former Sunni Arabs, who worked with the Ba'ath Party, into positions of influence.  The threat of Shi'a rebellion also forced Washington to draft a better solution to the continuing problem of Sunni militants. While before the Shi'a rebellion Washington had enough troop power to spar with these militants, faced with an insurgency encompassing two of Iraq's three main cultural groups, Washington quickly discovered that it did not have the troop force to fight so many different enemies at once. Now, in an effort to alleviate this danger, Washington has recruited former Ba'athist generals and placed them in positions of military power. By giving many former soldiers their jobs back, Washington hopes to eliminate much of the fodder that is impelling Sunni militants to attack U.S.-led troops.  Of course, this balancing act is difficult to maintain. As Washington helps Sunni Arabs achieve their interests, it risks upsetting Iraqi Shi'a, thus throwing off the balance once again. For this balancing act to be successful, Washington has to be very attuned to the concerns of all groups involved in Iraqi affairs and be able to rapidly shift its strategy in light of new political shifts and developments. Failure to do so will mean that inevitably Washington will be unable to sustain its balancing act; should this occur, a debilitating situation on the ground will likely erupt.

"            HIGHLIGHTS    Legal - Security   Lawmakers fear railroads are 'softtarget' for terror   Lawmakers yesterday questioned whether the federal government overlooked terrorism risks to passenger and freight railroads as it responded to the September 11 attacks.     'Our enemies seek a soft target,' Rep. Jon Porter, Nevada Republican, said during a congressional hearing.     The House Transportation and Infrastructure railroads subcommittee is investigating ways to avert attacks such as the March 11 Madrid train bombings that killed 191 persons.     The lawmakers asked the Bush administration to deliver a written plan for responding to terrorist threats against railroads.     The hearing coincides with other federal government efforts to catch up on railroad security after spending $11 billion on aviation security.     The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on Tuesday began a 30-day test at the New Carrollton train station to determine the feasibility of screening Amtrak and commuter rail passengers for bombs.     In addition, a Senate committee last month approved a bill that would spend $3.2 billion on railroad and port security.     Members of the Bush administration said yesterday their precautions against terrorist attacks on railroads focus largely on gathering intelligence reports and developing response strategies.     Chet Lunner, TSA assistant administrator, said the federal government should not concentrate security efforts too heavily on a single transportation mode.     'Without consistent application of reasonable and prudent security measures across modes, we risk creating weak links that may drive terrorism from one mode to another,' he said.     Mr. Lunner was uncertain whether the security checkpoints being tested at the New Carrollton station would be practical when large numbers of commuters are trying to board a train.     'That's exactly the kind of question we're trying to answer,' he said.     Allan Rutter, the departing head of the Federal Railroad Administration, said the railroad industry is developing a variety of terrorism risk precautions, including greater use of bomb-sniffing dogs, rail cars manufactured to withstand crashes and risk assessments of hazardous materials shipments.     However, he also suggested that Congress avoid heavy regulation of the railroad industry, saying a better option is 'a balance between security and economic liberty.'     Last year, the TSA opened a Transportation Security Operations Center to coordinate intelligence reports of threats with responses by law enforcement and the transportation industry, including railroads.     Since the September 11 attacks, Congress has spent about $115 million on mass-transit security.     In addition, Amtrak received about $100 million to harden its tunnels against bomb blasts. States and cities have the discretion to use some federal transportation funding for rail security but are not required to do so.     'I think it is time to switch our priorities,' said Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who is the District's nonvoting member of Congress.

Pakistan has said Abdul Qadeer Khan, a top nuclear scientist revered at home as the father of its atomic bomb, had smuggled nuclear secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya.   The scandal raised fears that weapons of mass destruction could reach the hands of militants bent on terror attacks as well as what Washington has called 'rogue' states.   The Pakistani government said the cabinet had adopted the draft bill on export controls.   'The draft bill manifests Pakistan's strong commitment to the prevention of proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons and missiles capable of delivering such weapons,' it said.   The statement referred to last week's U.N. resolution mandating countries to strengthen controls over sensitive technology and material related to weapons of mass destruction.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said the legislation, which parliament is expected to pass soon, had been under consideration for four years.   'This is big news for us,' he said.   Officials said the bill envisaged severe punishment for anyone found leaking nuclear technology or hardware, although this did not apply retroactively to A.Q. Khan.   Khan, who made a televised apology for his role in the proliferation scandal in February, is closely guarded at his home in Islamabad, although authorities deny he is under house arrest.   President Pervez Musharraf pardoned the popular scientist, who said he and a few associates acted alone. Western diplomats and analysts argue that he could not have acted without support from the powerful military.   International criticism of Musharraf for the scandal and of his decision to pardon A.Q. Khan was muted, perhaps in recognition of his key role in the U.S.-led war on terror.   But Pakistan has been under quiet, yet constant pressure to strengthen safeguards surrounding its nuclear weapons program.   Pakistan vowed to develop the nuclear bomb after rival India exploded its first nuclear device in 1974 and conducted five tests weeks after India carried out its own tests in May 1998.   Defense experts say Pakistan has about 25 nuclear warheads and India about 50, although estimates vary widely on the size of the secret arsenals.

He stopped short of apologizing.    'There will be investigations. People will be brought to justice,'  Bush said in a television interview that was aired in Cairo late Wednesday afternoon.  In the first of two planned interviews, the president did not specifically apologize for the mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.   But, he said,  'The actions of these few people do not reflect the hearts of the American people.'    'The American people are just as appalled' as Iraqis, Bush said, over images broadcast around the world of naked detainees and gloating U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib, a notorious prison during Saddam Hussein's regime that was taken over by U.S. troops.    'People in Iraq must understand that I view those practices as abhorrent. They must also understand that what took place in that prison does not represent the America that I know,'  Bush said.   'The America I know is a compassionate country that believes in freedom. The America I know cares about every individual. The America I know has sent troops into Iraq to promote freedom, good honorable citizens that are helping Iraqis everyday,' he said.   Bush said he retained confidence in Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and told him earlier Wednesday to 'find the truth and tell the Iraqi people and the world the truth. We have nothing to hide.'   Bush's appearance on Arab television came the day after the Army disclosed that it is conducting criminal investigations of 10 prisoner deaths in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus another 10 abuse cases.   In addition, the deaths of two Iraqi prisoners already have been ruled homicides. In one case, a soldier was court-martialed, reduced in rank and discharged from the Army. In the other homicide, a CIA contract interrogator's conduct has been referred to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Bush said the U.S. inquiry would look into whether such instances of abuse also took place in other prisons. 'We want to know the truth,' Bush said.   Bush said it was important for 'the people of Iraq to know that everything is not perfect. Those mistakes are made. But in a democracy, as well, those mistakes will be investigated, and people will be brought to justice.'   Administration officials have tried to assure the American public and the world that the abuse of prisoners at the prison was an aberration, and that guilty parties would be dealt with swiftly and firmly.   Bush said that the United States would cooperate with the International Red Cross.  Asked about the United States' practice of pointing out abuses of human rights in other countries, he said, 'We ... say to those governments, `Clean up your act.' And that's precisely what America is doing.'  The first Bush interview to air was with Al-Hurra, a U.S.-government funded Arabic-language station.  Al-Hurra is generally viewed in the region as propaganda. Another interview with Bush was expected to air later on Al-Arabiya television, a satellite channel based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that is popular around the Arab world.  The disclosure of the prisoner abuse, condemned throughout the world, came just two months before the United States is to turn over civilian authority to a new Iraqi interim government.  Bush said the U.S.-led coalition's decision to transfer security duties in the volatile city of Fallujah to an Iraqi battalion led by one of Saddam's former military leaders should not be a message to the Iraqi people that the United States was lowering its expectations for freedom in Iraq. 'Quite the contrary,' Bush said. 'We're raising expectations.'  Bush expressed continued confidence that a peaceful Palestinian state can emerge from the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is working on ways to revive his Gaza withdrawal plan after his own Likud Party overwhelmingly rejected the proposal in a nonbinding referendum.  While Bush's support for Sharon's territorial plans was condemned in the Arab world, Bush said, 'I felt that a withdrawal from the Gaza by the Israeli prime minister as well as the withdrawal from four settlements from the West Bank by the Israeli prime minister was a step toward peace.'

In the Arab version, dozens of cameras record the actions of 12 participants from various Arab countries who share an apartment. The program was filmed in Bahrain's Amwaj Islands, largely because of the help Bahrain gave to get it on the air and because of the islands' convenient location. (1)    The airing of the first episode sparked a stormy public discussion in Bahrain. Conservative circles organized mass demonstrations demanding that the broadcasts be immediately halted because of their damage to Islamic values. In contrast, liberal circles and Bahraini businessmen supported the broadcasts because of their contribution to Bahrain's economy.   Recently, Sheikh Yousef Al-Qaradhawi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader and a leading authority in Sunni Islam, discussed reality-TV programs, saying: 'The aim of these programs is to mislead the [Muslim] nation and to keep it from its own reality, so that it will live [in the reality of] these lesser things. Anyone to whom the nation is important must rise up against these deviant trends. There is no doubt that [our] youth are human riches, and represent the future of the nation. We must not abandon these riches or waste them with these imported television programs that do not reflect the character of the nation, do not represent its true image, and are a real invasion.'(2)  The following are excerpts of writings both in favor of and opposing the airing of the show:       Con:  The Program Is Against Islamic Values, Part of the West's Takeover Plans  Although MBC claimed that the Arabic version of 'Big Brother' was adapted to an Arab audience, the program's detractors insisted that it was against Islamic values. They pointed at the mingling of the sexes, the unveiled faces of the female participants, and the inappropriate behavior of some male participants - such as one boy who kissed a girl on the cheek.   A communiqué issued by the Islamic Al-Minbar Party stated: 'This program is nothing but another link in the long chain of media and tourism programs against the religion, values, and morality of this society. [This program] strikes unceasingly at Muslim sentiments in this respectable land... Dozens or hundreds of low-level jobs in tourism and the hotel industry will never justify openness to dubious investments that harm the sons of this homeland more than they help them.'(3)  Similar statements were also made by Shu'la Shakib, head of the Association of the Future women's organization, to the London Arabic-language daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat: 'We cannot agree to concessions on morals and on matters required by the religion in order to obtain investments.'(4)  Following these protests, a program spokesman announced the appointment of a Shari'a advisory committee, headed by Sheikh Mohsen Al-Usfour, a judge in the Supreme Shari'a Court of Appeals in Bahrain's Al-Ja'fariyya district, to monitor the program.5 A few days after he was appointed, Sheikh Usfour announced his resignation from the committee, saying, 'It is impossible to maintain Shari'a oversight on a program before perusing its content.' His resignation notwithstanding, Sheikh Usfour criticized the opposition to the program, saying: 'The mingling [of the sexes] in Bahrain is not limited to the 'Big Brother' program. It is everywhere, in the private schools and in the universities... Our Islamic libraries, in the cities and villages, have many religious books containing satanic Fatwas permitting prostitution, masturbation, watching pornographic movies, the artificial insemination of a woman by a man who is not her husband, a woman being alone with a strange man for purposes of polit ical work, and other things a thousand times more grievous than the 'Big Brother' program... It saddens me to say that some of those who are disseminating these satanic Fatwas are among those opposed to the 'Big Brother' program.'(6)  Some saw the program as part of a quiet war waged by the West to corrupt Arab youth. In her column in the Bahraini daily Akhbar Al-Khaleej, Samira Ragab wrote: 'The mistake is thinking that the 'Big Brother' program is only a television program that can be handled [merely] by objecting to its airing or filming in Bahrain... [But] it is a media war directed at and planned for the youth, which is targeted in this war strategy. Thus, stimuli and temptations [are directed] at the youth, which perhaps will be unable to absorb them, reject them, or refrain from sinking into them...   'The solutions [to this] are in our hands, and begin within our homes. Educate your sons and daughters to free and logical speech, distant from the burden of traditionalist words within their minds. Let them suckle concepts of nationalism, loyalty, and belonging to this great land and homeland. Let them suckle the concepts of Arab culture that emerged and grew under Islam and illuminated proper Islamic thought, not strict and extreme [Islamic thought]. Your children in your home are the weapons by which you will fight all the impending Tatar and Crusader attacks.'(7)  In a similar vein, columnist Fawziyya Rashid also wrote in Akhbar Al-Khaleej: 'It is completely obvious, and no secret ... that the American intention is to take over the Middle East... The plans to begin the occupation [of the Middle East] - whether directly via military occupation, as happened in Iraq, or indirectly via the occupation of the hearts and minds of the people - will come about in the framework of the American cultural, media, and political program aimed at changing [the face of] the Middle East, on the pretext of democratization and liberation. This will be done in the framework of a cold war [aimed at] infiltrating the minds [of the Arabs], and particularly the minds of the young adults who, according to recent statistics, make up 70% of the Arab homeland...  'After the occupation of Iraq, this began to take the shape of a cold war based on the American satellite channels, radio stations, and translated publications, and dragging in with it some of the Arab satellite channels to participate in disseminating the ideology and information of some of the American informational and cultural programs. As a result, the satellite channels hover above us [with programs] such as 'Ala Al-Hawa Sawa,'(8) 'Star Akademi,'(9) the 'Al-Hurra [channel],' many radio stations headed by [the American radio station] 'Sawa,' and also the 'Big Brother' program...  'When America invades our homes, our eyes, and our ears so intensively, it is aimed primarily at the Arab youth, which is a large percentage of all Arab countries. The 'declared' goal of this aiming [at the youth] ... is to distribute 'new ideas' and take part in 'mutual understanding and tolerance.' If these changes do not occur by means of [American] media and cultural infiltration, then they will be implemented by force, in order, as a senior White House official recently stated, to preserve American interests.   'In order to instill ideological, emotional, and spiritual change - that is, to infiltrate to within the individual and conquer his mind, the 'Arab Cultural Marines' are prepared for action, in the form of brigades of inspectors and Arab intellectuals who today act as an intellectual, cultural, and political 'line of defense' in the various American wars in the region... [In these wars], the American format is marketed and prettified to camouflage its invasion and occupation, in order [to cause people] to agree to it and in order to preoccupy the minds of the young and of the adults with insipid matters that are distant from the essential and dangerous issues in the Arab arena - issues that are headed by the resistance to the American and the Israeli occupations in the region...'(10)      Pro:  The Program Benefits Bahrain's Economy, And Canceling It Will Damage Bahrain's Image   Businessmen and liberal circles insisted that the program contributed to the Bahraini economy and called not to comply with the demand to halt its broadcast, because of the negative impact this would have on entrepreneurship in Bahrain.   Bahrain Businessmen's Association Chairman Khaled Al-Mu'ayyad said that the association sent its heartfelt thanks to the program's directors for choosing Bahrain as the focus of their investment, and blessed the Bahrain government for providing concessions for the communications company and thus creating new jobs for Bahrain's citizens.(11)    Bahraini MP Ahmad Ibrahim Behzad, who also heads the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and National Security Committee, said of the demand to halt broadcasting: 'Canceling the contract between those in charge and the program's initiators will damage the kingdom in general. [The damage] will be not only economic; it will also negatively impact the kingdoms credibility with regard to contracts, agreements, and pacts. It will also negatively impact the investor - whether local or foreign - and will help the flow of funds out of the kingdom...'(12)  Columnist Abd Al-Mun'im Ibrahim wrote in the Bahraini daily Akhbar Al-Khaleej: 'It is the people's right to demonstrate and march, but it is not welcome for them to go too far and refrain from investing, to embarrass investors, and to hinder the projects for the economy and development of the country. Where is the voice of reason? Many ask whether, if the 'Big Brother' program had chosen [to film in] Dubai instead of Bahrain, people would prevent their sons from watching the satellite channels, or be resentful because Dubai was hosting the program while we [had failed] to act to host it by ourselves and rake in the profits.'(13)  In his column in Akhbar Al-Khaleej, Ali Sayyar published an article sent him by a reader, 'Ali 2,' in response to his opposition to the 'Big Brother' program. The letter said: 'One of the advantages of the 'Big Brother' program is that it provided jobs for many Bahraini citizens and no one, in my opinion, has condemned this... Another advantage of the program is that it opened our eyes to the new format of the fascinating television programs that have not existed in our media.   'Yet another advantage is that it demanded high qualifications of its participants, such as broad general knowledge and also an attitude of politeness, etiquette, and cooperation towards others. This in particular is in light of Bahrain's anticipation of the day when its coming generations will be fit to live in [accordance] with their time, and not shut themselves away because of the pressure of negative heritage that cause embarrassment, hesitation, and fear of the other...'(14)       The Decision to Stop the Program     Following the uproar in Bahrain about the program, the administration of MBC decided to stop airing it. In an official communiqué, it said: 'The decision came following a request from the communications minister of Bahrain, the country hosting the program. [The decision was made] out of a desire to preserve [Bahrain's] social unity, and out of concern lest MBC constitute a reason for disagreement [in the country]...'(15)  Reactions to this decision were conflicting. Adel Al-Mu'awadah, the second deputy to the Bahraini parliamentary chairman, expressed his joy at the halt of a program 'that turned the individual into cheap merchandise bought and sold for $100,000.' He said that the decision to move the filming out of Bahrain was 'civilized and proper' and that MBC must be 'thanked and appreciated for doing the right thing.'(16)   In contrast, Khaled Al-Mu'ayyad, chairman of the Bahrain Businessmen's Association, called the decision 'regrettable' and expressed his hopes that 'those who caused the station to leave Bahrain and film elsewhere would appreciate the resulting damage, loss of funds, and loss of jobs' and that 'every group in [Bahraini] society must understand the implications of extremism, excess, and hysteria with regard to certain issues.'(17)      Endnotes:   (1)  Al-Itihad (UAE), February 21, 2004.

Around 5,600 troops are ready to go to Rio, although there is not yet a final decision on how many will be used in the operation to help out-gunned police in Brazil's second-largest city, a spokeswoman at the defense ministry said. Rio Gov. Rosinha Matheus last month asked Brazil's government for 4,000 troops to help police in Rio's hillside Rocinha slum. Clashes between drug gangs, whose arsenals include rocket launchers, mines and grenades, killed at least 12 people in April. The deployment of the troops would be the first time soldiers have been sent to Brazil's tourist mecca to help in the day-to-day fight against crime rather than to ensure safety during specific events. Troops were sent for the city's 2003 Carnival and for the 2002 presidential election.

Speaking at the launch in Gusau, the state capital, Governor Sani disclosed that time was ripe for full implementation of the programme as enshrined in the Holy Quran. He added that his government would soon embark on demolition of all places of worship of unbelievers in the state, in line with Islamic injunction to fight them wherever they are found.   The governor also disclosed that a law to compel employers of labor in the state to give their employees 'prayer breaks' five times daily would soon be enacted by the state House of Assembly.   The governor's stance on the demolition of all non-Islamic worship centres, however, runs contrary to the provisions of the country’s constitution, which states in Chapter 4, Section 38(1) that 'every person shall be entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom (either alone or in community with others, and in public or in private) to manifest and propagate his religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance.   Commenting on Governor Sani's decision, a lawyer and Chairman of Somolu Local Government, Barrister Ademorin Kuye, described the move as unconstitutional.    'The governor has no constitutional power to demolish churches in his state. The constitution guarantees the right of worship of every Nigerian. Nigeria is a secular state and a serving governor should not be seen as promoting one religion over the other,'  Barrister Kuye declared.  He warned the Zamfara governor not to embark on destruction of churches, as it would have grave repercussion in other parts of the country.   It would be recalled that Governor Sani introduced the Sharia Legal Code in the state in the year 2000, despite opposition from the federal government and religious groups. The implementation of the system led to the amputation of the wrist of a cow thief, Malam Jangedi. Governor Sani also made the retention of a long beard a condition for securing juicy contracts from the state government.  Source;  Copyright PM News.

Eduardo Ermita, the defence secretary, said in a press briefing that the authorities had begun proceedings to freeze several bank accounts holding a total of $25,000 of funds transferred from suspected JI leader Riduan Islamudin, also known as Hambali, currently under US custody.  It was the first time that Philippine security officials had been able to establish a detailed money trail from international terror suspects to their local partners, he said.  Philippine security officials are on heightened alert amid reports that the JI and local terror groups are planning to sabotage the May 10 presidential election.  Last month, six suspected Muslim militants said to be plotting major bomb attacks on shopping malls and western embassies in Manila were arrested.  The authorities also arrested 46-year old Jordan Mamso Addullah based on leads provided by US officials who interrogated Mr Islamudin, said Hermogenes Ebdane Jr., the Philippine police chief.  He added that according to US intelligence, the $25,000 was transferred in July 2003 and was delivered to JI members by an unknown courier flying in from Kuala Lumpur.  The authorities believe that upon receiving the money, Mr Addullah changed it into local currency and sent half of it to an Indonesian JI cell leader called 'Zulkipli'. 'Zulkipli' was then supposed to have deposited some of it in a bank and gave the rest to a JI bomber known only as 'Marwan'. Mr Ebdane said the remainder might have been used to finance a safe-house for the JI cell, Mr Addulah's money trading business and the dowry for Zulkipli's fiancee.  Apart from money laundering, Mr Addullah is also facing charges for possible involvement in at least three bombing incidents in the southern Philippine island of Mindanao, where most of the country's Muslim minority live.

If one were to believe the official version disseminated by Thai officials, civilian as well as military, this is what appears to have happened: Groups of machete-wielding Muslim youth raided nearly 15 village defence and police establishments in an attempt to seize the arms and ammunition kept there. The Thai security forces, who had advance inkling of the planned attacks, were waiting for the attacks when they came, and managed to repulse them.    Thirty-two of the survivors amongst the youth took shelter in a 16th century mosque near Pattani. After a stand-off lasting nearly six hours during which none of them was prepared to surrender, the security forces managed to kill all of them and free the mosque from their control.    Members of a local football team were among the 100 Muslim youngsters killed. About 16 of the attackers were captured. There were less than 10 casualties amongst the security forces.   The tactics adopted by the poorly armed Muslim youth bring to mind more that of the LTTE in the early years of its struggle against the Sri Lankan armed forces or of the Maoists of Nepal or of the tribal insurgents of India's North-East than that of the jihadi terrorists active in the South-East Asian and South Asian region. The LTTE, the Maoists and Indian tribal insurgents used to adopt such tactics to replenish their stocks of arms and ammunition.   What these young Muslims have exhibited in common with their co-religionists in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere is their fierce motivation and not the modus operandi adopted by them. They do not appear to be bandits or narcotics smugglers as projected by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand and his officials. They are politically and religiously motivated fighters, with no evidence so far of any external influence - either from the Jemaah Islamiyah of the South-East Asian region or the jihadi organisations of Pakistan and/or Bangladesh - on their mind.   Attacking in large numbers with machetes is not the known modus operandi of any of the identified jihadi organizations of the International Islamic Front. They do slit the throat of their victims with a knife, just as they slit the throat of a sacrificial goat with one, but they do not indulge in massive attacks on posts of the security forces and the police carrying only machetes.   If the Thai authorities' contention that they had advance information about the raids and had taken up position to repulse the raiders when they came is correct, it is unfortunate that they should have used excessive force against the ill-armed youth instead trying to overpower them or immobilize them by shooting below their knees.   The circumstances surrounding the attack on the mosque in which 32 young Muslims had taken shelter resulting in their death are even murkier. Leaders of the local Muslim community have alleged that no attempt was made by the Thai authorities to persuade the youth with the help of intermediaries from the local Muslim community to surrender.   The fact that despite being out-gunned and out-numbered, the youth chose to die instead of surrendering shows that these were not bandits or narcotics smugglers, but fiercely-motivated youth, who wanted to draw the attention of their co-religionists not only in Southern Thailand, but also in the rest of the Ummah to their anger and desperation.    Just as the raid of the Indian security forces into the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holy place of worship, at Amritsar in India in June 1984, aggravated the problem posed by the Sikh terrorists in Punjab, this raid by the Thai authorities is likely to aggravate the divide between the Muslims and the non-Muslims and the Muslims and the political leadership in Thailand.     There is already a wave of anger in Pakistan and Bangladesh over what is perceived as the deliberate massacre of Muslim youth in southern Thailand by the security forces. The Lashkar-e-Tayiba of Pakistan and the Bangladesh branch of the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami have been projecting southern Thailand as the Fallujah of Thailand.    This anger against the Thai authorities could result in acts of reprisal not only against the Thai leaders and officials in Thailand, but also against Thai nationals and interests outside the country by Harkat and Lashkar.

He succeeds Sir Richard Dearlove as head of the service, and will adopt the moniker 'C', common to all its chiefs.   Mr Scarlett was a relatively obscure figure, little known outside Whitehall, prior to the  urlLink Hutton Inquiry . He was head of the joint intelligence committee, the cabinet office body that prepares intelligence assessments for the government.   He had previously been MI6 station chief in Moscow, and was at one time responsible for handling the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky. He also worked for the service in Paris and Nairobi.   The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said he had made the appointment on the basis of a recommendation by a selection panel chaired by Sir David Omand, Downing Street's security and intelligence co-ordinator.   Mr Straw said: 'The secret intelligence service [MI6] is in the front line of our defence against terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and other threats.   'The role of the chief of the service is a vital and very demanding one. John Scarlett has the operational background, personal qualities and wide experience to be a worthy successor to Richard Dearlove.'   However, the Conservatives insisted that Mr Scarlett was not the man for the job. Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, said the appointment was 'inappropriate' in the context of the continuing inquries into the use of intelligence before the Iraq war.   'In today's world, Britain's secret intelligence service is central to our national security, and it is essential the whole country has the fullest confidence in it,' he said.   'The government-appointed Butler inquiry is currently reviewing the whole question of intelligence, and the use made of it, in the run-up to the Iraq war. Given that John Scarlett is central to that review, and that the inquiry has not yet reported, I believe that this appointment, at this time, is inappropriate.'   The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, also questioned the appointment, saying: 'It will only be justified if Mr Scarlett proves to be an effective head of MI6 at a time when success in the campaign against terrorism is essential.   'The responsibility for ensuring that he is not embroiled in political controversy rests fairly and squarely with ministers.'   Mr Scarlett joined MI6 after leaving Magdalen College, Oxford, with a first in modern history in 1970. He speaks Russian and French, and is married with three daughters and one son.   Downing Street said Mr Scarlett would follow MI6 practice in not giving interviews, making public appearances or providing on-the-record comment.   Sir Richard is to become master at Pembroke College, Cambridge.

The United Nations' security requirements, the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code, are mandatory for all merchant ships and ports engaged in global trade.   Yet only a fifth of the world's merchant fleet is compliant with the code, due in just 40 working days, leading industry figures say.   The United States, fearful of a seaborne attack against one of its ports by al Qaeda, has said it will strictly enforce the code and expects other nations to do so, raising fears that the measures could slow or even harm world trade.   Andy Mitchell, head of the maritime security programme at ship safety and classification societies Lloyd's Register, told Reuters that of the 30,000 ships trading internationally needing to be security-certified, about 20 percent had now been approved, up from around three percent in mid-March.   'There are going to be problems. Time is running out,' Mitchell said.   It was unclear how many of the 6,000 key ports involved had brought into force the new measures, said Lee Adamson of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organisation (IMO).   He too saw shipping compliance currently at 20 percent.   The measures apply to all ships - oil tankers, general cargo, and container or passenger ships - engaged in international trade.   The code also stipulates that ports visited in the complex web of trade need to be security certified and vessels required to keep a log of the last 10 ports they visit.   The U.S. Coastguard has repeatedly warned that ships, including oil tankers, that do not have security plans in place or that call at a non-compliant port could be denied entry, or in extreme circumstances be impounded.   In late April U.S. authorities said every ship seeking to call at one of its ports would be boarded and thoroughly checked from July 1.   According to the United Nations over 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, including crucial commodities like oil, gas, coal, iron ore and grains.   Leading maritime security firms that are advising signatory nations on implementing the measures at ports have told Reuters that many, mostly in the developing world and including some leading OPEC oil exporters, are struggling to meet the deadline.

Expansion as a Strategic Threat    In the wake of the September 11 attacks, the reinvented partnership between the United States and Russia has been heralded as an end to the Cold War Era. However, Moscow's continued objections against the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (N.A.T.O.) could serve as an indication that Russia still faces immense challenges on the path toward integration with the West.    N.A.T.O. has tried to reassure Moscow that the expansion is not directed against Russia. Nonetheless, Russia seems to feel isolated and threatened as up to two thirds of Russians view N.A.T.O. as an 'aggressive' bloc, according to recent opinion polls.   Russia fears that N.A.T.O. will go on expanding and the next round of expansion could involve Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries, completing what is seen in Moscow as the geopolitical encirclement of Russia. Some Russian commentators say that the eastward expansion of N.A.T.O. constitutes the biggest threat to their country since the Second World War.   Russia's fears of encirclement were heightened by speculation that other former Soviet states could eventually join N.A.T.O. Rumors swirled in Moscow that the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan could join N.A.T.O. as well. In April, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry had to issue a statement indicating that Kazakhstan had no plans to join the bloc.   Nonetheless, the State Duma, which is the lower house of the Russian parliament, lashed out at N.A.T.O.'s expansion to Russia's frontiers and urged the Russian government to re-think its defense strategies and deployment of its forces. The Duma's pro-Kremlin majority overwhelmingly approved a resolution that strongly urged N.A.T.O. members to ratify an amended version of the Conventional Forces in Europe (C.F.E.) treaty that would include restrictions on the deployment of weapons near Russia's borders.   In May 2002, Russia joined the N.A.T.O.-Russian Council, which gave Moscow a role in drafting and implementing several common policies on peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, weapons proliferation, humanitarian intervention and regional crises. The creation of the council indicated a transformation of N.A.T.O., which was established in 1949 to defend the West against the Soviet threat.   On March 29, N.A.T.O. expanded to 26 states, incorporating seven new members. Now Moscow argues that N.A.T.O.'s move eastward contradicted its pledge to enhance cooperation with Russia in counter-terrorism, nonproliferation, peacekeeping and other areas, contained in the 2002 agreement. N.A.T.O., in turn, has blamed Russia for failing to fulfill its pledge to withdraw its troops from the former Soviet states of Georgia and Moldova. Moscow argues that Georgia and Moldova are unrelated to the C.F.E.   Despite heated objections, the Kremlin has said that Russia would continue to cooperate with N.A.T.O. However, Moscow indicated it could reassess its military planning in view of what it called N.A.T.O.'s aggressive strategy. Moscow was particularly unhappy with N.A.T.O.'s decision to deploy aircraft to defend the airspace of the three ex-Soviet Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as soon as they join the bloc.   Although no other countries were likely to be invited to join N.A.T.O. soon, Moscow has sounded increasingly nervous about N.A.T.O.'s eastward expansion. Many Russian media outlets commented that N.A.T.O. aircraft would be deployed 'in five minute flight time' from the country's second largest city, St. Petersburg.   Of course, four old Belgian jets patrolling Baltic airspace hardly present any threat to Russia. Nevertheless, Russia's time-honored fears of encirclement resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russian power and influence hit near all-time lows. Furthermore, Moscow probably feels that its recent friendly moves towards the West did not really pay off.   In the wake of September 11, Russia has undertaken a series of gestures towards the U.S. In October 2002, the Kremlin announced a shut down of its Cold War Era military facilities: a spy radar station in Lourdes, Cuba and a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam to spare more money for the Russian armed forces. Russia also dropped its initial opposition to the stationing of American military forces close to its borders in Central Asia.   Moscow's pro-Western course after September 11 reaped benefits for Russia. Notably, in May 2002 Russia and the U.S. signed a legally binding treaty to reduce the two countries' long-range nuclear weapons by two-thirds and liquidate the legacy of the Cold War. Russia's new cooperative face secured U.S. backing for Moscow's efforts to join the World Trade Organization (W.T.O.). Russia also received membership in the G8 group of the most industrialized countries. Russia was recognized as a market economy by the United States and the European Union in 2002.   The invitation to Russia in 2002 for full participation in political and economic discussions, as well as to host the 2006 meeting of the G8, acknowledged Russian support in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks, and President Vladimir Putin's decision to accept the next round of N.A.T.O. expansion quietly.   As both N.A.T.O. and the European Union creep closer to the Russian frontiers, Moscow seems to opt a path of compromise. Russia and the E.U., which on May 1 expanded deep into Eastern Europe, had agreed in principle on all outstanding problems Moscow had with E.U. expansion, apart from the rights of Russian speakers in the Baltic States.   Russia and the E.U. forged a last minute agreement on April 27. The extension to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (P.C.A.) means that the ten new members joining the E.U. will trade with Russia under the same rules as the E.U.'s 15 existing members. The agreement comes after months of Russian refusal to sign the extension to the P.C.A. unless certain concerns were dealt with. The deal covers trade and all political, economic and cultural links between Moscow and the E.U.   The E.U. had insisted that the P.C.A. be extended automatically, causing a stalemate that lasted for months. Russia fears losing the trade benefits it enjoys with many of the new members, eight of which are former communist countries with which Moscow has close ties. Russia has been seeking compensation for the expansion. Moscow forwarded a list of 14 demands, including one to raise quotas on Russian steel imports.   The E.U. demanded that foreign and independent firms be allowed access to Russia's gas pipelines and to raise domestic gas prices to international levels. Russia's state-controlled monopoly Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, opposes any liberalization of the system. But Moscow would not be prepared to hike domestic gas prices and remove another major E.U. objection to its W.T.O. accession.   Russia and the E.U. also struck a deal on cargo shipments to and from Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which is wedged between incoming E.U. members Poland and Lithuania.   Yet progress on negotiations on Russia's entry into the W.T.O. remained slow. The E.U. reportedly offered Moscow smoother accession in exchange for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, a global environmental pact that the E.U. has pressured Moscow to ratify.   The European Union and Moscow have yet to solve a dispute over treatment of the Russian minorities in the Baltics, particularly in Latvia and Estonia. Russia has long complained about what it calls discrimination against Russian-speakers in Estonia and Latvia. In the end, the joint declaration did not specifically refer to Russian minorities but to minorities in general.   Russian objections against N.A.T.O.'s eastward expansion, combined with long-standing Russian fears and suspicions over Western intentions, demonstrate that Moscow still faces a long path towards full-scale partnership with its Cold War Era foes.

Two guided-missile destroyers, four guided-missile frigates and two submarines displayed China's military strength for the first time since the territory was handed over by Britain in 1997. It marked a distinct change of tactics by Beijing.   The Chinese military has been a nearly invisible presence here for the last seven years. Soldiers are required to wear civilian clothing when they leave their bases, and the main base is tucked away on an island at the harbor's western end.  But today, residents here watched as a submarine sailed past the downtown Bank of China tower, designed by I.M. Pei. Sailors in dress whites lined the sides of the destroyers and frigates, and some gave friendly waves to workers on a passing tugboat.  The People's Liberation Army described the visit as an occasion to honor the navy's 55th anniversary. But there was no such visit on the 50th anniversary in 1999. Today's display, too, came as people favoring popular elections here find themselves under growing pressure.  The city's best-known radio talk show host, Albert Cheng, a longtime supporter of greater democracy and a critic of the local government, flew to Europe on Sunday, beginning a vacation that he said would last for the rest of the year.  He left behind a tape recording, aired Monday, in which he complained of growing threats of violence against himself and his family. It described an increasingly 'suffocating' political atmosphere.  Raymond Wong, Mr. Cheng's co-host of the popular, Chinese-language 'Teacup in a Storm' show, said in a telephone interview today that he was considering whether to resign. He described receiving many anonymous death threats that, he said, were not troubling to him but had alarmed his family.  Mr. Wong owns a noodle shop and Mr. Cheng a small trading company. Both businesses have been vandalized with large quantities of red paint at night this spring.  Auto dealerships owned by Mainland Chinese enterprises have pulled their advertising from Apple Daily, one of the city's largest Chinese-language newspapers and a rare supporter of greater democracy.  Most of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing property tycoons have also been withholding ads from the newspaper since this territory's democracy movement began gathering steam last summer, according to an Apple Daily executive who insisted on anonymity.  Beijing has made a series of moves in the past four months to block further democracy here. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced last week that it would not allow introduction of universal suffrage in elections for the next chief executive in 2007 or for many seats in the Legislative Council in 2008.  London and Washington denounced that decision as undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong, something that China had promised to uphold. China rejected the criticism, pointing out that the British had opposed democratic freedoms through most of the century-and-a-half Hong Kong was a colony.  Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, issued a statement today highlighting Beijing's willingness to dictate rules for the 2008 legislative elections, something it does not have a legal right to do under the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution. Moody's said that Beijing's actions made it more clear that the credit ratings of Hong Kong and China should be linked. Moody's already does that informally, although still granting Hong Kong a rating one notch better than the mainland's.  Martin Lee, the founding chairman of the Democratic Party, tried to amend a non-binding motion in the legislature last Friday to condemn Beijing's decision. Rita Fan, the president of the Legislative Council, who was appointed to the body by a Beijing-dominated committee, ruled that the amendment was out of order.   Ma Lik, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, the main pro-Beijing party, said he opposed any threats against democracy advocates. He questioned whether Mr. Cheng and Mr. Wong had really been in any danger.  While noting that both men had frequently criticized him on the air, Mr. Ma challenged them to identify those responsible for threatening them. 'We want to know who frightened them, and we will fight for their freedom of speech,' Mr. Ma said.  Mr. Lee said that he doubted that Beijing would order any direct measures to harm democracy advocates here. 'They kill your reputation, but not you,' he said.  Hong Kong has long had an extreme leftist, pro-mainland fringe that is not under the control of either Beijing or the Democratic Alliance. It may, however, have been emboldened by recent strong criticisms of democracy advocates by pro-Beijing media, said Joseph Cheng, a pro-democracy professor of political science at Hong Kong University who is not related to Albert Cheng.  In sailing along the harbor after a six-day visit to a naval base at the harbor's western end, the Chinese flotilla clearly chose the most visible route possible. Most ships sail in or out of the western harbor without going through the central harbor itself - an increasingly narrow route. Because of landfills, that is now limited mostly to cruise ships and occasional pleasure craft.  Joseph Cheng said that the flotilla's visit could prove a shrewd move by China, because the well-behaved People's Liberation Army forces evoke feelings of patriotism among many Hong Kong residents.   Mr. Lee criticized the naval display today as unnecessary. 'Nobody here wants independence, so there's absolutely no need for them to do this,' he said.   Robert Karniol, the Asia-Pacific editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, said that today's naval display was consistent with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain acknowledged that China would have full responsibility for the defense of Hong Kong. The two guided-missile destroyers, the Shenzhen and the Harbin, that sailed past the office towers of central Hong Kong are among the more modern vessels in China's fleet, he added.

The new era of European enlargement will be no exception.    Europe has never existed. It must be created.' So said Jean Monnet, father of the original Common Market, at the outset of the grand experiment that over the past five decades grew to become the modern European Union. Were he alive today, would Monnet survey his creation with pride-or reservation?  On May 1, Europe braces for another of its periodic Big Bangs. Not war but its antithesis-a regime of stability and (one hopes) growing prosperity spanning a region of 370 million citizens from the Aran Islands to Carpathia. Ten new nations will join the existing 15 members of the European club: eight formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe and the Baltics, plus the divided island of Cyprus and tiny Malta. It is by far the most ambitious enlargement ever undertaken by the European community. Yet curiously, this epochal step inspires more angst than euphoria.   Ask a German diplomat about the EU of tomorrow, and he pauses. 'The new Europe,' he says thoughtfully, 'is looking more and more like the old Europe.' For half a century, he explains, Europe has dedicated itself to overcoming division and creating an 'ever-closer' political and economic union. The Europe of the future, he predicts, will retreat from this ideal. Instead of coming together, Europe's trajectory will be more toward the past-more toward discord and division than toward unity. Years from now, as  The Economist magazine recently put it, Europeans may well look back at today's era as a lost 'golden age' of harmony and good feeling. With only slight exaggeration, May 1 can be viewed as marking the beginning of the end of 'Europe.'   Too pessimistic? Consider recent headlines, challenging traditional assumptions that Europeans inhabit a common house. British Prime Minister Tony Blair last week changed direction and called for a national referendum on Europe's new draft Constitution, painstakingly cobbled together over the past two years and needing unanimous ratification by the Union's member governments. Blair could have simply approved the document; by turning it over to voters, likely to reject it, he in effect cast a veto over the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, as the Union dismantles geographical barriers to the free movement of people and goods, others are going up. Fearing floods of immigrants from the East, taking jobs from locals and overwhelming social services, governments across the Continent have hastily erected restrictions against the incoming members of their European family. Germany and France, among others, have barred such workers from seeking jobs for periods ranging from three to seven years. Similar controversies have erupted over everything from the EU's budget to economic development. After years of touting their commitment to helping their neighbors rebuild from years of communism-much as they helped Greece, Spain and Portugal resurrect themselves from decades of autocracy-the rich members of the Union are balking at the cost.   Spats over budgets and internal migration may pass with time, but some of the endings occasioned by May 1 will be more enduring. Consider three:    THE END OF EUROPE AS THE WEST:   'If you want to read the future of Europe, look east,' says Jean-Marie Colombani, director of Le Monde in Paris. Until now, the European Union has been a purely West European institution, whose interests lay traditionally within the geography of the NATO alliance. With enlargement, he argues, 'the center of gravity of the old Continent will move east.' Europe's new backyard is a morass of failing states-Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova-whose problems will become Europe's. 'What are the priorities of Poland, Hungary and the Baltic nations?' asks Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoanna, whose own country seeks to join the EU. The first is to reap the economic rewards of EU membership. But the second, he says, is to ensure their own security-and that means shifting Europe's diplomatic and financial attention to the problems on their periphery to the east, in lands Western Europe has long ignored.     THE END OF AMERICA IN EUROPE:   Ever since World War II, the United States has been a European power. It created NATO and planted the original seed of European integration by making Marshall Plan aid contingent upon it. It was the guarantor of cold-war security. Transatlantic tensions over the Iraq war are only one sign that Europe and the United States are today on divergent paths. U.S. strategic interests long ago shifted to the Middle East and Asia, says Ronald Steel, author of 'Temptations of a Superpower.' If America was present at the creation of Europe's postwar order, it is now bidding adieu at its passing.     THE END OF EVER-CLOSER UNION:   Even in its earliest days, when the modern EU was but a glimmer in the eyes of the creators of the original European Coal and Steel Community, Europe held close to a dream. It went by various names: 'more Europe,' 'deeper Europe' and, of course, 'ever-closer union.' It began with the relatively simple task of eliminating tariffs and was to culminate in a 'federal Europe,' with governments devolving economic and political sovereignty upon the institutions of the European Union. Visionaries predicted the end of the nation-state.   As the EU embarks on its boldest move yet, that dream is all but dead. Yes, never before has such a broad swathe of Europe been subject to the harmonizing rule of Brussels. Yet Germany and France, once the locomotives of union, have lately gutted the EU stability pact limiting the fiscal independence of member governments. Joined by Britain, they have reaffirmed the primacy of national governments in foreign and social policy.  The beleaguered new Constitution-an attempt to define what it is to be European, and how 'Europe' should govern itself-resides in emblematic limbo. Ever-closer union? 'Not in our lifetimes,' predicts the German diplomat.   'If this is the end of old Europe, what is now beginning,' asks Tony Judt, director of the Remarque Institute at New York University. As he and many others see it, Europe's future will be managing its growing diversity. Mounting immigration, especially Muslim, will increasingly alter Europe's ethnic and cultural landscape. Changing demographics will undermine Europe's traditional social-welfare states. If old Europe faced the challenge of integrating like with like, the new Europe must reconcile unlike with unlike, grappling with prickly issues of minorities, wealth versus poverty and national identity. 'It will be an era of discord and civilizational clashes within states and communities,' says Judt, 'no longer mainly among them.' Europe's disparate citizenry will argue for their very different interests and priorities with increasing vehemence, all the more so if Europe's economy does not keep pace with the region's expectations. The cozy days of a close and like-minded European club are gone. Back to the future? It looks very much that way.   Source;  Newsweek International, May 2004. © 2004 Newsweek, Inc.

(Catholics and Muslims)   The Vatican has never been simply he religious headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. It has always been involved in politics to promote or defend its doctrines and institutions. In this effort, the Vatican has at times supported violent conflict while on other occasions stressed peace and tolerance. In recent years it has been troubled by the growth of the Islamic population in Europe, which some Catholic leaders call 'a program of expansion and reconquest.'    The National Catholic Reporter in October 1999 noted that, according to the United Nations, the Islamic population grew by more than 100 percent in Europe from 1989 to 1998 to fourteen million, while over the same period 'the Muslim population in the United States grew by 25 percent to 4.9 million.' Specifically, French Catholic leader Alain Besancon indicated that there are between four and five million Muslims in France - roughly the same as the number of practicing Catholics. Marseilles is expected to become the first city in Europe with a non-European majority.   These are not just theoretical concerns about the future. There have been violent clashes between Catholics and Muslims in the past, even though the Vatican kept a low profile and tried to involve other nations in diplomacy. One such clash occurred in Lebanon in the early 1970s when the Maronites - one of the major Christian groups in Lebanon, whose relation to the Vatican dates back to the period of the Crusades - contacted the Vatican to find out about possible training centers for Maronite militia in Europe.  According to George E. Irani's 1986 book, The Papacy and the Middle East: The Role of the Holy See in the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1962-1984:  -A secret military organization based in Rome sent experts who had previous experience in the wars of southern Sudan and Biafra.... These experts in guerilla warfare picked the best among Christian militias and sent them to the city of Anvers [Belgium] where they joined special training centers.... [The Vatican] advised the Maronite monks to fund the training of the militias through the Phalangist Party.   The Vatican did not seek the defeat of the Muslims or other groups but involved the United States and France and initiated its own efforts with the fundamental objective 'to save Lebanon as an independent state in order to protect the Christian presence not only in Lebanon but throughout the Middle East.'   In Europe, the Vatican has for many years viewed Croatia as a Catholic bulwark against Muslims from the Middle East and against Soviet penetration from the east. When Croatia became part of Yugoslavia after World War I, Vatican policy changed after a decade to one of detaching Croatia and building it as a uniquely Catholic state hostile to Yugoslavia.   A group of fascist terrorists known as Ustashi allied itself with Italian Premier Benito Mussolini and also worked with Germany's Adolf Hitler. Under the lead of Ante Pavelic, the Ustashi created the Independent Government of Croatia and was officially welcomed by the Catholic hierarchy through Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac. Stepinac was the head of the Council of Bishops in Yugoslavia and also the military apostolic vicar of the Ustashi army. Pope Pius XII not only bestowed his paternal protection upon Pavelic and the new Croatian state but allied the Roman Catholic church with Italian, Spanish, and German fascism. When World War II ended and Mussolini and Hitler were defeated, Pavelic hid at the Vatican before going to Argentina; Yugoslavia was reconstructed.   Since memories are short, in 1991 and 1992 both Croatia and Slovenia, predominantly Catholic republics, declared their independence and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman revived the Ustashi flag. The Vatican was the first to recognize Croatian independence while the republic was fighting against Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. Toward the end of 1993, Croatian leaders stated that Muslim militants were about to begin a full-scale jihad against the West. Iran had sent financial aid and several hundred revolutionary guards as military instructors to Bosnia.   Pope John Paul II, however, realized that if the Muslims were defeated Islamic nations would turn against the Christian West. So he worked against the massacre of the Muslims and pressured the leaders of the Western alliance to step in. This eventually happened when the United States sent covert arms to the Muslims and through the Dayton accords arrived at a truce in 1995 to stop the war.   An important factor in Catholic support of Croatia was Opus Dei (The Work of God), a secret and highly disciplined order with huge sums of money and 80,000 members worldwide. It was successful early in the papacy of John Paul in persuading him to make the order his personal prelature--the equivalent of a bishopric without a territory. The most exhaustive book on the subject, Their Kingdom Come: Inside the Secret World of Opus Dei, written by investigative reporter Robert Hutchson in 1997, says:  -Opus Dei's Washington network, which by then (1993) extended from the papal nunciature on Massachusetts Avenue to the White House, the F.B.I., and the Pentagon, provided the Croats with the right contacts.  An Opus Dei member, Father Ron Gillis, revealed that the order 'was attempting to recruit inside the Pentagon and that he himself regularly gave lectures there on military ethics.'   In 1994 Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak appealed to the Clinton administration for help 'in educating the Croatian General Staff.' The State Department agreed to let Military Professional Resources (MPR) go to Zagreb after a visit to the Croatian capital in September 1994 by John Paul, who urged the Croats to continue standing firm for Christendom. Retired U.S. Army generals and colonels led MPR. Its aim was to change Croatia's army into one that could get battlefield superiority over Serbia. Upon Croatia's request, Iran was also given the opportunity to ship arms to Bosnian Muslims through Croatia so they could defend themselves against the Serbs.   While these developments with Croatia were taking place, John Paul was advised by Opus Dei leaders to form an alliance with Islamic fundamentalists to prevent the September 1994 United Nations-sponsored Cairo Conference on Population and Development from approving contraception and abortion. A papal envoy was sent to Iran and to Libya a month before the conference and deals were arranged for fundamentalists' support in Cairo. Opus Dei also organized a closed-door conference in Barcelona, Spain, in early 1995 to deal with Islamic immigration to Europe and also the fact that Islam was winning recruits among Europe's Catholics by the hundreds each year.   These efforts have been part of the Vatican's larger strategy to deal with Islamic forces. Alternately, it has been one of negotiation and one of conflict, preferably enlisting others to fight the Vatican's wars.   In February 1993 John Paul visited Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, where a war had been going on between the Islamic north and the Christian south. The Sudanese government had cleaned up the Cathedral at Khartoum and prepared a nearby square for an open-air mass for the pope. However, he failed to achieve better relations when he warned Islamic leaders head on to stop killing Christians in the south and to stop the 'terrible harvest of suffering.' Not long thereafter, the Sudanese north began a new offensive in the south.   The Vatican did not respond immediately, but sometime in 1995 Christian Solidarity International appeared in the south. The organization enlisted support from neighboring countries and built a disciplined resistance force.  No one seems to know anything about its origin or whence came its resources, but it was able to destroy an elite mechanized division from the north and take all of its equipment.   Pope John Paul II has no hesitation about the killing of those he regards as opponents. He holds that 'Christians [Catholics] have a right and even a duty to protect their existence and freedom by proportionate means against an unjust aggressor.' The word unjust is used to define any war against the church. And if there is any doubt about Opus Dei and its relation to the papacy, it is dispelled by Their Kingdom Come, which quotes two rules of the secret order: 'The lesson is clear, crystal clear: All things are lawful for me, but not all things are expedient' and 'Dirty clothes are washed at home.'   John Paul has apologized specifically to Jews for the centuries of anti-Semitism by the church's people, but he has never apologized specifically to Muslims for the many crusades organized against them. Father Georges Cottier, a theologian whose international theological commission helped draft Memory and Reconciliation: The Church and the Mistakes of the Past, explained why not in the March 2, 2000, New York Times:  -It cannot be done with the Muslims, because Islam does not recognize the Christian notion of pardon.... In places where Christians [Catholics] and Christian missionaries are in the minority, it would be taken as a sign of weakness. We couldn't write it down that way, but that was the thought.  In other words, even the pope's apologies for past sins of church members were not simply spiritual pronouncements but matters of strategy evaluated by the potential response of his audience.   Would an apology specifically to Muslims make a difference in relations with Islamic nations? It might, because there are millions of nonfundamentalist moderate Muslims in Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. But until then, anyone who reads the news about violence against Christians (Catholics) and against Muslims anywhere in the world should be aware of the consequences of the conflict between two of the world's numerically largest religious groups-each numbering about one billion people and each with antagonism toward the other.

Given the sorry condition of public education, many Americans today would have no idea which war our current Republic fought first. The real fighting began in this war early in 1804, two hundred years ago. Sad, because this war is probably the best example of how different America and Europe approach terrorism.    The Barbary Pirates, like al-Qaida, were organized terrorists; they, like al-Qaida, were Moslems who originally began their terrorism as part of a general religious war against Christians; they, like many of the Islamic terrorists today, operated in the Mediterranean Basin; these pirates, like al-Qaida, lived nominally within another nation, the Ottoman Empire, but they operated outside the control of this nation and beyond the reach of international law.   Most European nations appeased the Barbary Pirates. Rather than confront these outlaws, European nations allowed themselves to be blackmailed. These bigger and more powerful nations gave money to the Barbary Pirates so that these goons would leave them alone.   America, young, small and weak at the time, took a radically different attitude. The whole world knew that the actions of the Barbary Pirates were wrong, but only America decided to fight this wrong. 'Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute!' was the battle cry of our infant nation.   We projected our naval and marine power to a place almost as far away as Iraq, and using dash and daring, we defeated the Barbary Pirates.  Considering how much millions of dollars was in 1804 (hundreds of billions of dollars today) and considering how much farther Tripoli was given the technology of the time, our victory - without coalition forces - was much more daunting that our liberation of Afghanistan or Iraq.   Special forces, the United States Marines, and our small, but robust navy, did what no European nation thought possible or prudent. Our Marines projected American power 'to the shores of Tripoli' as the Marine Corps Hymn recounts. Although it would take eleven years, with European nations finally following the lead of America, to end completely the threat of the Barbary Pirates, the pirates learned that hurting America was very counterproductive.   This, perhaps, should be our reaction to the faint hearts and trembling hands of European politicians today. The Barbary Wars were fought to protect Americans, not Europeans. The national security policy of the United States at that point in history was 'Don't Tread on Me.' Perhaps that should be our policy again.   What if America advised al-Qaida, Kim Jong Il, the mullahs of Iran and other modern pirates and pirate nations that if they kill Americans or attack America, then we will use our global power to hit them back hard? What if America qualified that by saying 'Don't Tread on Me' rather than 'Don't Tread on Civilization'?   Is there a particular reason that we should defend modern, affluent democracies treat us contemptuously for our help? Maybe we should consider more the position of Israel, which relies upon no one for its defense, but insures that it is defended. Our ability to project power into Afghanistan and into Iraq should chill the heart of any terrorist groups who gratuitously provoked our wrath.   Instead of bringing democracy to Iraq perhaps we should divide it into three smaller nations and quite deliberately throw our considerable support behind any or all of these new governments whose policies toward America are friendly.   Instead of bringing democracy to Syria, perhaps we should simply overwhelm that nation, divide it as well, and create two or three new nations dependent upon our goodwill for their success against other rivals.   Instead of worrying about the life of other peoples, we should worry about only ourselves. We are accused of doing this anyway, so what if we pronounced that this, indeed, would be our policy? I wonder what the world would say.   The practical effect of our First American War - the war that began in earnest exactly 200 years ago - was that the rest of the world, including Europe, suddenly took us very seriously. 'Don't Tread on Me' may be an imperfect motto for our national policy, but in light of a fickle Spain, an ungrateful France, and grumbling already in Iraq, maybe that is the best policy we can take. It worked magnificently once.    Write;  by Bruce Walker writes regular, original, and weekly columns for Enter Stage Right and Conservative Truth.

"            HIGHLIGHTS   SOUTH AFRICA – LEGAL   You'll pay, US lawyer tells SA government   Six apartheid victims, including the mother of a teenager shot dead in the 1976 Soweto riots, are seeking $20-billion dollars (about R140-billion) in a lawsuit targeting the South African government and major corporations, their lawyer said on Monday.   The suit was filed in New York District Court on Saturday, demanding at least $10-billion for 'genocide, expropriation and other wrongful acts' by international companies under apartheid, American lawyer Ed Fagan told a news conference.  The plaintiffs are also seeking another $10-billion in damages because President Thabo Mbeki's government 'continued to allow companies to exploit victims without protecting them, allowing industry to violate people's rights.'  'These companies were strategic partners of the apartheid government' The full amount would be paid into what Fagan termed a 'humanitarian fund.'  'At the end of the day these companies were strategic partners of the (apartheid) government,' Fagan said.  The post-apartheid government set up in 1994 was targeted in the case 'because of its failure to fulfil its obligations and its conspiracy with specific companies to violate these people's rights,' he added.  Apart from Mbeki, the suit targets mining giants Anglo American and Goldfields; United States computer giant IBM; UBS Bank of Switzerland and South African petroleum giant Sasol.  Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Dorothy Molefi, the mother of 13-year-old Hector Petersen, who was shot dead in Soweto in June 1976 when police opened fire on schoolchildren and teenagers who had gathered to protest against the imposition of Afrikaans - seen as the language of the white oppressors - in schools.    'South African matters resolved in South Africa'   The picture of Petersen being carried away by two teenagers became iconic of black South Africa's struggle against racist oppression.  Mbeki's spokesperson Bheki Khumalo said the government would defend its case, but wanted 'South African matters resolved in South Africa.'  'If Ed Fagan has decided to do this and he has indicated that he is doing it, well, the government will have to go to court and defend itself. We are convinced that we have a winable case.'  Mbeki has in the past condemned any moves to sue major companies in the US, arguing that many of the companies were now assisting in South Africa's development.  Fagan said the civil action was separate to that of a class action on behalf of apartheid victims already before a New York court, and from which South African lawyers claimed Fagan had been dismissed.  This was disputed by the flamboyant US lawyer: 'I was never fired. I merely took a back seat. It was them who were fired.'  He has also drawn scathing criticism from civic groups for raising the expectations of poor and mainly black victims of apartheid.  Fagan became prominent when he won a $1.2-billion compensation claim by Holocaust survivors against Swiss banks, including UBS and Credit Suisse, in 1998.  Fagan said his clients would give the South African government two weeks to respond to a 'proposal' - without divulging details - before the case would go ahead.  'Make no mistake about this. This is not a game, it is not a procedural play, it is not a show. It is a deadly serious lawsuit, it has legal legs, it has legal precedent.  'If our allegations are true, you are going to pay,' he said.  Fagan said he did not want to comment on the other case already before the New York courts - in which judgment had been reserved - were 34 companies were being sued for billions of dollars.

More than 130 members of the 250-seat legislature have prepared a draft of the 'America Accountability Act' that would impose 'strict sanctions' on American interests in Syria.  In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Damascus, parliament officials said the draft law is a response to 'Washington's policy in the region and its unlimited support and bias for Israeli policies and practices and to the Syria Accountability Act.'  The Syria Accountability Act is a U.S. law passed last year that calls for sanctions against Syria for its alleged support of terrorism. Syria denies the U.S. claims and says the sanctions are political.  Muhammad Habash, a lawmaker with moderate Islamic affiliations who is one of the campaigners for the draft law, said the law was meant to maintain the dignity of Syrians.  'We are not simple-minded to the degree that we imagine we can affect the great American economy,' he said. 'But we are able to maintain our dignity and slap the Americans so they know that if they continue with their arrogant policies, people everywhere around the globe will spit at them.'  In May, President Bush banned all U.S. exports to Syria except for food and medicine, and banned Syrian flights to and from the United States after long-standing complaints that Syria was supporting terrorism and undermining U.S. efforts in Iraq.  The sanctions were based on the Syria Accountability Act. The parliament statement said lawmakers would submit the draft law for a vote June 27 during a Parliament session in which Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara will explain the Syrian government's rationale for imposing the sanctions. The statement said the law was expected to pass overwhelmingly.  It would have to be ratified by President Bashar Assad before becoming law.  The statement did not give details on the nature of the sanctions Syria will impose.  Lawmaker Suleiman Haddad said the sanctions may be in the form of boycotting American goods but would not be a complete boycott of the United States, though he said some members of parliament supported that option.  'We in Syria believe that there is still a thread between us and America,' Haddad said in a telephone interview Saturday. He said the sanctions would not impose restrictions on U.S. companies working in his country.  Trade between the United States and Syria amounts to $300 million a year. Several U.S. companies operate in Syria, which in the last year has signed oil-exploration deals with American companies worth a total of $34 million.  The U.S. sanctions imposed under the Syria Accountability Act also authorize the Treasury Department to freeze the assets of Syrian nationals and entities involved in terrorism. They also restrict relations between U.S. banks and the Syrian national banks.

An Ingushetia Interior Ministry official said the attack on the ministry building in the city of Nazran began late on Monday. The official also said police buildings in Ordzhonikidzevskaya, just over the border from Chechnya, and in Karabulak have been seized by other attackers.  There is no official word on casualties, but witnesses said that dozens bodies are lying around the Interior Ministry building.  Ingush sources reported that Interior Minister of Ingushetia Murad Kostoev was dead. Dozens of Russian occupation solders and FSB servicemen's were kill when Mujahideen attack Russian military bases in Ingushetia.  In an interview on Radio Liberty last week, Chechnya's president Aslan Maskhadov said that Chechen solders were preparing to undertake new offensives.  'We are planning to change tactics. Before, we concentrated our efforts on acts of sabotage, but soon we are planning to start active military actions,' he said.  A three-man crew from Russia's NTV television came upon some of the attackers at a border crossing as they tried to reach Nazran from neighboring North Ossetia.  'Out of the dark, a voice says 'Stop, put your hands on the hood,' said NTV correspondent Maxim Berezin. 'A man carrying an automatic weapon came up. 'Who are you?' 'We're from NTV.' He took a few steps back, as if to shoot us.  'Then he said, 'Say that we are the Martyr's Brigade,' I don't remember of whom, Abu, Alyua, I don't remember what he said. 'We have shot everyone here. Go and announce that.''  The town of Karabulak and village of Sleptsovskaya also came under attack. Mujahideen killed many Russian occupation solders on military base in Troickaya village near airport. Reports say a multiple rocket launcher was being fired in Nazran and other towns of Ingushetia, and people were sheltering in cellars.  Reports also say that 30 solders of Interior Ministry of Ingushetia were dead.  At 3 a.m. 22 June Mujahideen are begin leave villages and towns of Ingushetia.

Greeted with a standing ovation, Annan opened the first U.N.- organized seminar dedicated to anti-Semitism in response to charges that the world body dwelled on Palestinian rights and deliberately ignored injustices to Israelis and Jews.  'When we seek justice for the Palestinians - as we must - let us firmly disavow anyone who tries to use that cause to incite hatred against Jews, in Israel or elsewhere,' Annan told the gathering, which included a wide spectrum of American Jewish groups and representatives of other religions.  Annan said it was hard to believe that 60 years after the Holocaust that anti-Semitism was rearing its head.  'But it is clear that we are witnessing an alarming resurgence of this phenomenon in new forms and manifestations,' he said. 'This time the world must not, cannot be silent.  Annan called on U.N. member states to adopt a resolution to combat anti-Semitism, similar to one approved in April by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Fifty-five nations said the Middle East conflict could never justify anti-Semitism and attacks on Jews.  He also said the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights, should examine anti-Semitism with the same diligence it looked into racism against Muslims in various parts of the world.  'Are not Jews entitled to the same degree of concern and protection?' Annan asked.  Jewish leaders pointed to dissent in the Arab world they say is descending into expressions of extreme anti-Semitism and a flurry of incidents in Europe, especially in France and Russia, they felt had not been addressed properly.  Only Germany came in for praise for its education system and tough laws to combat anti-Semitism, despite rising fears among the Jewish community there. There was little discussion of anti-Semitism in the United States where there are about 5 million Jews, slightly more than in Israel.  Author Elie Wiesel, the Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor, said he thought anti-Semitism had perished in the Auschwitz death camp, but 'only the Jews perished there.'  Wiesel, the keynote speaker, said that discriminating against Jews often translated into hatred against all minorities and 'those who are different.'  'When we urge you to fight anti-Semitism, it is because we want to save other people as well,' he said.  Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, demanded Annan appoint an official charged with combating anti-Semitism, an annual report on the subject and a resolution to 'unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism.'  The United Nations came in for heavy criticism, especially from Anne Bayefsky, a professor and fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, who said Israel was demonized on a regular basis while Arab nations got away with redrawing the map of the Middle East.  To cheers from the audience, she castigated the United Nations as well as Annan for an 'inability to confront the corruption of its agenda.'   Felice Gaer, a human rights and U.N. expert from the American Jewish Committee, said there were enough U.N. resolutions on the books against racism and intolerance but U.N. officials appeared afraid to activate them.  But she called Annan's address 'forthright and unique in U.N. history. 'It's as good as it gets,' she said.

A British military spokesman said the craft, which entered Iran's territorial waters, cannot be contacted.  Eight British sailors have been arrested by Iran. The seacraft were detained near the Iraqi border after, said Iran, they had entered its waters without permission.  A spokesman for the officially appointed Iranian Revolutionary Guards said: 'We got news that a number of foreign vessels entered Iranian waters without permission.  'Three boats were guided to Iranian shores and more than five crew were arrested.'  Iranian naval sources told the country's media eight British crew were arrested after their vessels were found to contain weapons and maps.  One station said the crew had confessed to making 'a mistake' and that the Iranian navy had confiscated the three vessels.  The confrontation was said to have taken place in the Shatt al Arab stretch of water between Iraq and Iran.  Sky News' Foreign Editor Tim Marshall said: 'Iran is making a point to Britain probably, and that point is 'back off'.'  He added that Iran may be using the incident as a bargaining tool against British-backed UN demands on its nuclear programme.  A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defence said it was investigating the reports. Royal Navy boats patrol the waterway - a highly disputed boundary between Iraq and Iraq - to prevent smuggling.

The San Jose Mercury News said Monday the proposed November ballot measure was aimed at getting more parents involved in their children's education by waiving California's requirement that voters be U.S. citizens.  San Francisco has long been a home to a large Asian immigrant community as well as growing numbers of Latinos. Only those non-citizens with children in public school would be allowed to vote, and only in school board elections.  The Mercury said a similar proposal that would have allowed immigrants to vote in all municipal elections was rejected in 1996 by a judge who ruled the move would require an amendment to the state constitution.  If passed, the measure would be the first in California, although similar laws have been enacted in New York, Chicago and Maryland.

Beheading has been adapted widely by Muslim radicals for killing enemies in recent conflicts in Algeria, Bosnia and Chechnya, experts said.  But the executioners of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002, Pennsylvania businessman Nick Berg in Iraq on May 11 and aviation engineer Paul Johnson in Saudi Arabia on Friday have turned the act into propaganda by using digital cameras to record the spectacle.  On Friday, the grisly images were posted on the Web for a global audience, including Westerners for whom decapitation is particularly shocking.  The Site Institute - a Washington organization which tracks terrorist groups - located on Friday an Arabic-language communiqué about Mr. Johnson's killing accompanied by grim photographs of the murder on a website set up recently using the free service provided by Geocities, a subsidiary of Yahoo!.  Said Site analyst Josh Devon: 'Terrorism doesn't work unless the media is involved. Shooting someone isn't necessarily terrorism.  Beheading someone and posting it on the Web is terrorism.'  In Mr. Pearl's case, video footage of the murder was delivered to the US consulate in Karachi. Only later was it posted on the Internet and aired in part by CBS News.  The video of Mr. Berg's killing was posted immediately on the Web, provoking a storm of grief and outrage.  Mr. Johnson's killers managed to draw even more attention by announcing in their Web posting on Tuesday that he would be killed in 72 hours if their demands were not met.  'Here, we had the countdown: This guy was alive, but yet we knew he was doomed as the 72-hour countdown went on,' said Mr. Robert Thompson, a media and culture expert at Syracuse University in New York.  The combination of ritual murder with digital communications 'is this bizarre collision of worlds'.  He said the Internet had a powerful pull for terror groups because it allowed instant, international distribution to groups that otherwise could not broadcast their message through traditional media.  He said terror groups had been savvy enough to recognise, however, that only the most violent, most graphic events will draw attention.  'You can't put just anything on the Internet and expect people to pay attention,' he said.  'I can think of few things other than a beheading that is able to singularly focus people's attention.'  Mr. Marc Sageman, a former CIA officer and author of Understanding Terror Networks, said militants in Algeria, Chechnya and Bosnia had used decapitation widely.  'This has become the ritual way of slaughtering infidels,' he said.  'That's the way you slaughter animals, so I suppose it's a way of saying infidels are no better than animals.'  While beheading went out of use long ago in the West, the Saudi government still uses it for executing men and occasionally women for serious crimes, occasionally including religious crimes such as blasphemy.  The government's senior executioner, Mr. Muhammad Saad al-Beshi, gave several media interviews last year, bragging that his sword is 'very sharp. People are amazed how fast it can separate the head from the body'.

The court case, which commences on July 5 with an in loco inspection, could decide the future of the Gana and Gwi Bushmen communities.  Two hundred and forty-eight Bushmen and Bakgalagadi adults are taking the Botswana government, including President Festus Mogae, to court over the government's forced eviction of them and their families from their ancestral land, in what could be a test case for Bushman rights across southern Africa.  The in loco inspection is supposed to visit settlements from which the San were allegedly forcibly removed from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve to settlements outside the reserve.   'Expected to become farmers overnight'   The Bushmen want the government to recognise their right to return to their land and live there without fear of further eviction, and to hunt and gather freely.  The original case of forced removal from their ancestral land was dismissed on a technicality in April 2002.  However, the Bushmen appealed and won the right to have the case re-heard on its merits.  The Botswana government had initially apparently terminated all services, including water, because it claimed that it could not afford the monthly cost of Botswana pula 55 000.  The first wave of removals took place in 1997, and most of the community has since been relocated to settlements outside the park.  In exchange for their traditional hunting-gathering existence, the Botswana government claims the San have been granted title deeds to plots, a mere 40 by 40 meters, in a conservation area - the Central Kalahari Game Reserve - about the size of Belgium.  The displaced tribesmen have also allegedly been given goats and cattle.  'People as old as 80 years and older who have been hunter-gatherers all their lives were expected to become farmers overnight', a South African spokesperson for the applicants said on Monday.  But the Botswana action has drawn strident opposition from Survival International, a British organization supporting tribal communities and their rights to their land and to decide their own future.  The organization has been at the forefront of an awareness campaign; organizing petitions across the world against the removal of the San and even suggesting that diamond prospecting could be behind the relocation.  Survival International also accuses the Botswana authorities of harassment of the San, saying they have been 'tortured, beaten up or arrested for supposedly over-hunting, or hunting without correct licenses.'  The Botswana government has vehemently denied these allegations, as well as that diamond prospecting was at the root of the relocation.

The chart does not give the number of victims. Different sets of figures have circulated for years. In 1994 the Interior Ministry cited a figure of 11, 000. In 1996, Socialist opposition leader Hocine Ait-Ahmed estimated the number of those killed at almost half a million. In1999 Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika, then a presidential candidate, put the number at 'over 100, 000'. My estimate, based on information collected from many sources since 1994, produces a figure of around 28,000. But we still need years of painstaking research to establish the full facts.  There is more accurate information about the numbers and the frequency of terror attacks. The chart mentioned above shows that terror attacks reached their peak between 1994 and 1996. At some point, in 1995, the various terror groups were able to launch up to 30 more or less simultaneous attacks each day. In some cases, the terrorists killed hundreds of people in a day, the record being reached with the massacre of an estimated 500 people in the village of Ben-Talha.  In March 1994 during a visit to Algiers it was hard to avoid the impression that the Algerian state was on the verge of collapse and that the terrorists would soon ride into the capital to seize power. The nation had suffered human and physical losses on the scale of a conventional war. The damage done to its economic and administrative infrastructure by the terrorists ran into billions of dollars. Thousands of municipal buildings, schools, clinics, libraries and private homes had been destroyed. Dozens of villages had been turned into desert, their inhabitants driven out or massacred.  By 1996, however, the tide had begun to turn against the terrorists and within a year it was clear that Algeria was no longer in mortal danger. By 1999 Algeria had won its war against terrorism.  A similar story could be told of Peru, the Latin American nation most affected by terrorist war.  At one point, the main terrorist organization known as Sendero Luminoso (The Shining Path) was capable of striking anywhere and anytime it wished. Over almost two decades, the terrorist war claimed the lives of at least30, 000people, mostly civilians. By seizing control of a good chunk of the illicit narcotics trade, the terrorist groups had access to an almost endless source of cash to finance their campaign.  And, yet, by 1999 Peru, too, seemed to be emerging from its ordeal. With Sendero Luminoso flushed out of its safe havens and its leadership in the can, the Peruvian state was able to reassert its authority even in the deepest jungles of the hinterland.  Algeria and Peru are not the only nations to have faced and defeated modern terrorism. Egypt and Turkey have had similar experiences with exceptionally brutal terrorist movements.  Today no fewer than 22 countries are affected by terrorism of one form or another. In some, like India, the Philippines, Thailand and Myanmar, the state has succeeded in containing the terrorist threat without fully defeating it. In others, like Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, terrorism has transformed into low- intensity warfare that could continue for years.  Elsewhere, as in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast and Uganda terror groups have organized themselves into mini-armies that control large chunks of territory and threaten the central state.  But all these experiences reveal one important fact: No terrorist movement in the past two decades has succeeded in overthrowing the state and seizing power for itself. This is in contrast with the experience of the previous decades that saw several terrorist movements, often disguised as revolutionary guerrilla movements, come to power on a wave of violence.  How did Algeria, Peru and other nations that have defeated terrorism managed to do so in the face of heavy odds?  The question is of interest to the latest victims of terrorism, including Saudi Arabia.  While Algerian, Peruvian and other experiences in fighting terrorism show important differences, they all have several key features in common.  The first of these is a psychological determination on the part of the ruling elites to stay the course. One central aim of the terrorist, of course, is to instill fear in society in general and the elite in particular. By refusing to be frightened, society and its leaders achieve their first victory against the terrorists.  This, of course, is easier said than done. In Algeria, for example, the terrorists launched a campaign of murdering university teachers and students, especially girls. Scores were killed, mostly by having their throats slit. The immediate effect was dramatic. More than half of the students of the Algiers University stayed away for weeks and months. By 1995, however, the authorities had provided enough security to persuade the students, and their teachers, to return. This was still an act of daily courage on the part of tens of thousands of young people who were prepared to risk their lives but not to allow terrorists to close the universities.  In both Peru and Algeria the authorities started by grouping key personalities of the system in fortified neighborhoods so as to protect them against assassination attempts. But they soon realized that this made the task of the terrorists easier. The terrorists, using a few people for surveillance, could chart the movements of all the key people to and from a small area. This gave them fixed targets while they themselves enjoyed maximum mobility.  The terrorists achieved spectacular successes by killing many top people. Dozens of ministers, governors, mayors, trade union leaders, political party personalities, prominent media men and women were murdered in Peru and Algeria. In Algeria they even assassinated the head of state.  Later, both countries decided to spread their key personnel widely, beyond the terrorists' capacity to organize surveillance operations leading to assassinations.  The second lesson to learn is to understand the difference in the rhythm and tempo of the terrorist organization and the state security forces. The terrorist is almost always capable of running the100 - meter course faster than his state adversaries. He aims at achieving big victories quickly and with a few spectacular operations. The state security forces, on the other hand, must be prepared to draw the terrorist into a marathon course. They need to slow things down as much as possible and to make sure that even the most spectacular attacks fail to produce the results desired by the terrorists.  The third lesson to learn is the strategy of forcing the terrorists into fixed positions before moving against them. The terrorist constantly seeks anonymity, like fish in water.  But he also needs safe havens, hospitals, recreation centers, places to hide his bigger weapons, and facilities to train new recruits or imprison potential defectors. All this means a loss of mobility, which is the terrorist's key advantage over the state.  In both Algeria and Peru, and to some extent even in Turkey and Egypt, the state decided to actually help the terrorists become fixed targets.  In Algeria, for example, the anti-terror units deliberately stayed out of some areas, notably the Mitidja plain and the town of Blida, thus shooing the terrorists there. On some occasions the security forces even refused to intervene to stop terrorist operations that took place under their noses, so to speak. The idea was to convince the terrorists that they had a safe haven. In time this meant that the terrorists became fixed targets while the security forces enjoyed the advantage of mobility and the choice of the time to attack.  Counterterrorism experts know the fourth lesson as 'the onion principle.' This means treating the terrorist organizations as bodies constituted by numerous layers. The classical counter terrorist method is to look for the core of the 'onion' in the hope of eliminating it. But in both Peru and Algeria, it soon became clear that it was more efficient to deal with the outer layers first.  These outer layers provide finance, information, surveillance, espionage and a variety of logistical support for the core groups. Thus disrupting or destroying them would have a direct impact on the efficiency of the core groups.  Dealing with the outer layer is also important because they offer opportunities for misinformation campaigns and, more importantly, infiltration. This method was most successfully used in Egypt where the authorities managed to infiltrate virtually all terror groups, at times right to the highest levels of their leadership.

That's the key question, which the New York Times has once again failed to answer, this time in an otherwise informative story by Greg Myre ('Israel Says Children Enlist Children as Suicide Bombers', June 13,2004).  While Myre pulls no punches when it comes to telling readers how Palestinian children are now recruiting their classmates and cousins to become suicide bombers, he shies away from telling readers why Palestinian kids have taken up this grisly task.   In Myre's rendition the child recruitment is a mystery - he reports only that 'some Palestinian leaders have condemned the use of teenagers, and opposition to the practice is widespread among ordinary Palestinians...' Could the Palestinian kids have been indoctrinated in their schools? Myre casts doubt on this, reporting at face value the claims of one Palestinian school official that he tries to keep politics out of the classroom, 'This place is for education and we don't want to talk about politics.'  Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. Far from being opposed to child suicide bombers, Palestinian society and Palestinian leaders revel in child 'martyrdom,' and the Palestinian media and schools do all they can to encourage a cult of death among children. The paramount Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, for example, stated in an interview on Palestinian TV that: '... this child who is grasping the stone, facing the tank, is it not the greatest message to the world when that hero becomes a shahid [martyr]? We are proud of them...' (PATV, Jan. 15, 2002 cited in Ask for Death, Palestinian Media Watch.)  While Arafat's words certainly carry weight among Palestinian children, perhaps the most effective recruitment tool has been music videos, which are broadcast for hours on end by official Palestinian television (there is no independent television under Arafat's rule). The videos are a call to death and martyrdom for Palestinian children, promising the glories and pleasures of heaven to the young 'warriors for Allah':  'How sweet is the fragrance of the shahids, how sweet is the scent of the earth, its thirst quenched by the gush of blood flowing from the youthful body.' (Quoted by Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the Jerusalem Post, January 29, 2004)  Another music video also aimed at children and broadcast repeatedly told young viewers that:  'Oh, young ones: Shake the earth, raise the stones. You will not be saved, O Zionist, from the volcano of my country's stones.  You are the target of my eyes, I will even willingly fall as a shahid [martyr for Allah].   Allahu akbar [god is great]! Oh, young ones!' (Quoted by Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the Jerusalem Post, June 2, 2004).  Yet another music video shown repeatedly on Palestinian TV centered on a Palestinian child who had been killed at the start of the present violence in October 2000. A young actor portrays the child in paradise, flying a kite and running on the beach, and encouraging other Palestinian children to follow him in martyrdom, 'I am waving to you not in parting, but to say, 'Follow me.' '  (Itamar Marcus and Barbara Crook in the National Post, April 8, 2004). As for the claim that Palestinian parents oppose such suicide bombings, news reports, including in the Times, indicate the opposite. For example, a few months ago Myre's colleague James Bennet reported that 'Many Palestinian parents have praised their sons and daughters for carrying out suicide attacks, hailing them as heroes and martyrs.' (New York Times, March 25, 2004)  Palestinian support and encouragement for child suicide bombers is an ugly reality. The Times' reluctance to deal with this ugly reality will help only to perpetuate it.

"            HIGHLIGHTS   U.S.A.  – POLITICAL AFFAIRS   Impeachment process was illegitimate: Clinton   Former President Bill Clinton has called his fight against impeachment a 'badge of honour' and his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky 'morally indefencible' in a CBS television interview.   In the hour-long interview on CBS 60 Minutes to be telecasted on Sunday, two days before publication of his memoir My Life, Clinton said he was proud of his successful fight against impeachment, the network said in excerpts released on Wednesday.  'I didn't quit, I never thought of resigning and I stood up to it and beat it back,' he said.  'The whole battle was a badge of honour. I don't see it as a stain, because it (the impeachment process) was illegitimate,' added Clinton, who called the process 'an abuse of power.'  Clinton's more than 900-page memoir, published by Alfred A Knopf, hits book stores on June 22.  He told 60 Minutes that high on his list of regrets was his affair with Lewinsky, which he called 'a terrible moral error.'  Clinton said his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, were able to overcome the effect of the revelation of the affair through counselling.  The former president said Hillary needed time with him to decide whether she would stay married to him.  'We'd take a day a week, and we did - a whole day a week every week for a year, maybe a little more - and did counselling,' said Clinton. 'We did it together. We did it individually. We did family work.'  Clinton said there was no rational explanation for his adulterous behaviour.   'I did something for the worst possible reason. Just because I could,' the former president said. 'I think that's just about the most morally indefencible reason anybody could have for doing anything.'  Clinton also discussed other issues during the interview, including the war on terror and Osama bin Laden and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and regretted his failure to convince Yasser Arafat to accept a proposal he thought could finally bring Middle East peace, CBS said.

Used for what is commonly known as 'jamming,' the Improved Capabilities System III (ICAP III) overloads specific hostile communication bandwidths, causing users to temporarily lose service.   'Training and testing of ICAP III is a stepping-stone for the Navy,' said Chief Aviation Structural Mechanic Ron Szpynda, Air Test Evaluation (VX) 9.  'This is the first time we have used this system.'   VX-9's EA-6B Prowlers are being used to test the system. The aircraft provides protection for strike aircraft, ground troops and ships, by jamming enemy radar, electronic data links and communications.  'The system floods an opposing bandwidth with more frequency than those operating systems release,' said Cmdr. Jim Winship, VX-9 branch head. 'This causes users to temporarily lose service. Everything from telephones to sophisticated electronic equipment goes static, because the jammer can overwhelm the frequencies they use.'   More than 9,000 Navy, Marine, Air Force and Coast Guard service members from units stationed in the continental United States and the Pacific theater have come to Alaska to participate in the joint training exercise.

The 10-minute arraignment drew about 30 protesters to the federal courthouse in Trenton, and prompted the U.S. Marshal's Office to heighten security in and around the building. But the demonstration was peaceful and the court proceeding ended without incident.  The defendants, members of the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty, were indicted last month on charges of conspiring to commit animal enterprise terrorism, an offense punishable by three years in prison. Prosecutors contend the defendants encouraged and in some cases planned attacks to intimidate the research company Huntingdon Life Sciences, its clients or associates.   Huntingdon uses thousands of animals - mainly rats, but also dogs and monkeys - to conduct product safety tests each year for its clients, primarily pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers. The company is based in London, but performs most of the tests at a laboratory in Franklin Township, Somerset County.   In 1999, opponents formed SHAC and vowed to shut down the company. The indictment contends the group posted an online list of 'Top 20 Terror Tactics' that encouraged attacks, threatening letters and phone calls, e-mail 'bombs' to crash computers and home invasions against Huntingdon employees and business associates. Most of the actual incidents alleged to have occurred were acts of vandalism.   The charges represents a rare prosecution under a federal law enacted to respond to what critics said was an upsurge in violent animal rights activity. Members of such groups say the prosecution could be a test case for how far the government can go in policing activism.   U.S. District Judge Mary Cooper tentatively set an Aug. 17 trial date, but attorneys said they probably will ask for an extension.   Executive Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles McKenna, who is prosecuting the case, said the evidence includes phone wiretaps and surveillance that yielded 440 audiocassettes and 50 videotapes. He told the judge that the case, 'in many aspects, isn't the standard case.'   Five of the seven defendants had lived until recently in central New Jersey, not far from the Huntingdon lab. The others hail from Long Island and Washington State. Almost all are in their mid-20s.   One, Darius Fullmer, is a paramedic. Another, John McGee, is a first-year law school student at Rutgers University. A third, Andrew Stepanian, was a student at the C.W. Post campus of Long Island University, his attorney said last month. The others - Kevin Kjonaas, Lauren Gazzola, Jacob Conroy and Joshua Harper - are 'social justice volunteers,' according to online statements from the group.   Each entered identical not-guilty pleas yesterday. They declined to discuss the case, but are planning a multistate speaking tour to highlight their arrests.   Cooper approved court-appointed attorneys for each, but several private defense attorneys said after the hearing that they plan to ask the judge to let them represent the defendants for free.   'This case is about First Amendment practices in the 21st century, the use of modern technology, the freedom to use Web sites to speak for any cause,' said Andrew Erba, a Cherry Hill attorney who said he has represented civil rights groups before. Erba said he expected to represent Kjonaas, 26, who calls himself the president of SHAC-USA.   Attorney Daniel Perez said he has advised Gazzola for more than a year and intends to represent her at trial. Perez said the group did nothing more than advocate protection for laboratory animals.   'All these people are really accused of is running a Web site that reports on the activities of the animal rights movement and supports direct action,' Perez said. 'They did not engage in illegal activity. They exercised their rights to free speech. So when I read the indictment, my reaction is, where's the beef? Or maybe I should say: Where's the tofu?'   The free speech issue was a favorite for the protesters who toted signs and chanted slogans for about an hour before yesterday's hearing. Armed U.S. Marshals ringed the building, with riot gear stored inside the entrance alcove just in case.   'I came here because this is a travesty of justice,' said David Lambon, 31, of Norristown, Pa. Lambon said he was an independent activist and a college student 'between schools.'   'This case is about more than just SHAC,' said Camille Hankins of New York Animal Rights Activists, who led chants outside the courthouse with a bullhorn yesterday. 'It's about the right to engage in community activism everywhere.'   Source;  Star-Ledger, June 04  Write;  by John P. Martin and Brian T. Murray. John P.

The commission, which presented new findings as it conducted its 12th round of hearings in Washington, said the Al-Qaeda chief continued his links with the region even when he moved to Sudan in 1991.  'Al-Qaeda had never entirely left the region, even when headquartered in Sudan, it had used Pakistan and Afghanistan as a regional base and training centre supporting Islamic insurgencies in Tajikistan, Kashmir, and Chechnya,' said one of the two reports that commission investigators, introduced at the ongoing hearings.  Bin Laden returned to Afghanistan in May 1996, and as soon as the Taliban, a Pakistan-backed Afghan faction seized control of Kabul in 1996, he began building close relations with them.  'Pakistan did not break with the Taliban until after 9/11, although it was well aware that it was harbouring bin Laden,' the report said.  'The Taliban's ability to provide Bin Laden a haven in the face of international pressure and UN sanctions was significantly facilitated by Pakistani support. Pakistan benefited from the Taliban-Al-Qaeda relationship, as Bin Laden's camps trained and equipped fighters for Pakistan's ongoing struggle with India over Kashmir.'  The training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan provided multifaceted skills to Islamic terrorists because a worldwide jihad needed terrorists who could bomb embassies, hijack airliners, or provide foot soldiers for the Taliban, 'and guerrillas who could shoot down Russian helicopters in Chechnya or ambush Indian units in Kashmir,' noted the report.  Furthermore, it said, Al-Qaeda had a worldwide network of recruiters and travel facilitators, and 'there are strong indications that elements of both the Pakistani and Iranian governments frequently turned a blind eye to this transit through their respective countries.'  The two statements of findings by the commission also reveal other aspects of the war on terrorism that may impinge on Bush's presidency.  The reports said specifically that the commission could not find any substantive link between Al-Qaeda and the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussain.  The report also noted that bin Laden did not have any personal fortune of $300 million, a much touted number in the past, to support his activities. Rather, he raised the money through the network of charities and fundraisers and used the 'hawala', an informal method to move money around the world.  'Bin Laden relied on the established hawala networks operating in Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and throughout the Middle East to transfer funds efficiently,' the report stated.

The warning, from President Mohammad Khatami, came as the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna prepared to adopt a resolution strongly critical of perceived continuing Iranian attempts to block and deceive the inspectors.   'We had, we have and we will have, a nuclear programme to enrich uranium to produce fuel,' said Mr Khatami - in what is a blow to Britain, Germany and France, which last year struck a widely hailed deal for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment.   'With the ongoing trend, we have no moral commitment any more to suspend uranium enrichment,' Mr Khatami said.   There has been discontent in the EU - and more visibly in the US - at the Iranian approach since it agreed to suspend enrichment. The IAEA says the country has continued to make equipment and refine crude uranium for the enrichment programme.

If the government gets its way, even routine transactions of buying or selling American homes could soon come under the scrutiny of money-laundering provisions of the USA Patriot Act. The Treasury Department, which already has caught up financial transactions in casinos, storefront check-cashing stores and auto dealers for scrutiny, wants to expand Patriot Act coverage to home purchases as well.  Since 9/11, critics say the greatest effect of new state and federal antiterrorism laws has been on crimes already covered by other laws.  Washington-area snipers John Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were both convicted under a post-9/11 Virginia antiterrorism statute making it a death-penalty offense to be involved in more than one murder in a three-year period. Muhammad was sentenced to death, and Malvo was given life imprisonment without parole.  The FBI has used Patriot Act provisions in a political corruption probe involving a Las Vegas girlie bar, and the Justice Department reported to the House Judiciary Committee last year that it used the new law in probes of credit-card fraud, theft from a bank account and a kidnapping.  In the first action of its kind, the Treasury Department also used the Patriot Act this year to put Syria's largest commercial bank and two commercial banks in Myanmar on blacklists actions that forbid any U.S. financial institution from doing business with them.  Legal experts say they're not surprised that antiterrorism laws are being used for more than just terrorism.  Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University, recalled that Congress adopted antiracketeering laws in 1970 with the intent to thwart mobsters, but the punitive laws have since been broadened and put to use in civil cases against corporations, and most recently against the organized campaigns of pro-life protesters against abortion clinics.  Swire worked in the Clinton administration and chaired a White House working group looking at issues involved with electronic surveillance. He said many Patriot Act provisions, which sped through Congress within days after 9/11, were proposals that either Congress or the White House had previously rejected. Many provisions are slated to expire next year unless Congress makes the changes permanent.  Swire said one little-noted impact of that law on the judicial system is that prosecutors can add more charges against defendants, even when terrorism isn't involved.  'Prosecutors like to have more arrows in their quiver it gives them more leverage in plea bargaining,' he said. Plea bargaining is the process where prosecutors offer to drop some charges in return for a defendant's guilty plea in order to avoid costly, time-consuming trials.  Swire contends the Patriot Act has been so controversial that the Justice Department has been very cautious in using all of its provisions.  'They are careful because they know people are checking to see if it is abused,' he said. 'Once it becomes permanent, I think it will be used more widely.'  The American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups are campaigning for Congress to terminate some of the more controversial provisions of the Patriot Act, contending the law unnecessarily expands government powers.  The ACLU says the government already has sufficient investigative tools, and the Patriot Act has been used for non-terrorist-related crimes such as seizing stolen funds from bank accounts in Belize.  Michael Mello, a law professor at Vermont Law School, disagrees and said the Patriot Act made some needed changes in government procedures, including provisions that tore down barriers that prohibited the FBI and CIA from sharing information.  'There's been a sea change by tearing down that wall,' said Mello. 'To forbid the FBI from getting spooks' (CIA) information that someone in the United States was carrying out a significant criminal enterprise is insane.'  In spite of the criticism from the ACLU and others, Mello said he doesn't believe the Patriot Act has been misused or has resulted in any expansion of government powers. 'In the absence of evidence, the critics lose,' he said.  Mello agrees that there are some provisions in the Patriot Act that should be allowed to expire. He opposes a controversial provision allowing the Justice Department to use so-called 'national security letters' to obtain library records, medical records and banking records of people put under surveillance. The Patriot Act wasn't needed when police searched library records in the hunt for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski or the effort to track New York's Zodiac killer, Mello noted.  Many government activities under the Patriot Act remain shrouded in secrecy. One of the provisions not expiring is an expansion of police powers to obtain 'sneak-and-peek' warrants allowing surveillances - including break-ins - without notifying the people being watched.  The government is being more aggressive in asking courts for surveillance warrants. The Justice Department last year made a record 1,727 requests for wiretap approvals from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but does not publicly disclose how many investigations that might involve.  Attorney General John Ashcroft told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that the Patriot Act has been used judiciously, and he urged Congress to give speedy consideration to extending it.

But court president Fawwaz Bakur commuted the sentence against the only one in court, Jordanian Ahmad al-Rayati, to seven and a half years with hard labour 'to give him a chance to improve himself and because he is a bread-winner', the court said.  Riyati, 35, was among 15 people on trial since October. Eight of the absentees were also given 15 years but one was killed in a shootout in April.  The remaining six, all Jordanians who lived in Iran, had died under mysterious circumstances and in an unidentified location, prosecutors said in March, and Bakur dropped charges against them.  One of the absentees sentenced is Najm al-Din Faraj Ahmad, also known as Mullah Krekar, the founder of Ansar al-Islam, or Supporters of Islam, who has been cleard in Norway of charges of funding terrorism and inciting murder.  Al-Rayati was specifically charged with having received military training in Afghanistan and training others in Tehran to 'prepare poisons and produce explosives for assassinating heads of the Jordanian intelligence service'.  He was arrested by US troops in Iraqi Kurdistan during the US-led war on Iraq in March 2003 and extradited to Jordan.   Norwegian inquiry  Al-Rayati denied all the charges against him and interrupted the verdict by shouting at the court.  'I am not a criminal. You are the criminals,' he said, adding that he wanted to leave Jordan to live in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip.  Mullah Krekar is on a US list of terrorist organisations, alleged by Washington to be linked to al-Qaida and having mounted attacks on US-led forces in Iraq.  'I am not a criminal. You are the criminals' Ahmad al-Rayati, defendant in state security court trial  On Tuesday Norwegian prosecutors in Oslo dropped their case against Krekar citing lack of evidence, but the United States said it still had serious concerns about him.  He had been the target of a Norwegian police inquiry since September 2002. Among other allegations he is suspected of involvement in a conspiracy to murder Kurdish political rivals and funding of 'terrorist' organisations.  But Krekar, who has been living in exile in Norway since 1991, still faces an expulsion order for posing a threat to national security and violating his residency permit by returning to Iraq several times.  He founded Ansar al-Islam in December 2001, although he insists he has not led the group since May 2002 and denied all the charges against him.  Ansar al-Islam used to control a small group in northeastern Iraq before U.S forces pushed it out in late March last year. It then allegedly had between 700 and 900 members.

Chirac is just the latest in a line of Frenchmen that has given the United States a long and seemingly unending, migraine headache.   As President Bush sat on the podium with Mr. Chirac - who was looking pompous as only Chirac can - it was obvious by the body language of the president that he would rather have been having a root canal done without Novocain than be sitting next to this man, Chirac, who reeks of arrogance and delusions of grandeur and needs to be frisked for the knife he always buries in the back of American presidents. While Bush did what was expected of him, giving the French leader due respect, Chirac seemed to feel no need to return the favor, even publicly.   There was a time, of course, when France was important. That was a long, long time ago and somewhere along the line France got the reputation of being just a tad quick to surrender to enemies. Has France had a great leader since Napoleon?   You might ask: 'What about the French Foreign Legion?' Well, it that seems no French are allowed in the French Foreign Legion. Perhaps that's why it is so feared.   It has been said that we wouldn't have won the Revolutionary War without help from the French. The war may have lasted a year longer, but would the war have been lost without our 'good friends' the French? What were the French after? Did they help us out of the goodness of their hearts or did they just want to poke a stick in the eye of their nemeses, the Brits?   Americans are even insulted by the French in Canada. The French Canadians tried to tear Canada apart and become a separate country, loyal to France and not England. French Canadians want to be independent, but prefer to sing the praises of the great French culture instead acknowledging Canada's English roots. It must drive French Canadians crazy that the Queen is on Canadian money and still honored after all these years. Canada's last president from the French providences, Jean Joseph Jacques Chretien, loved France so much that he named his first child, France. Chretien's loathing of the United States was very apparent every time he spoke. Following Mother France's socialist course, Chretien also destroyed Canada's military and ran their economy into the ground paying for social programs. It is unknown if Canada's military inherited the surrender gene from the French or the strong fighting gene from the English. Perhaps it depends on what part of Canada the soldier hails from.  The world met the great French leader and general, Charles De Gaulle, in the 1940's. De Gaulle received his promotion to general in the field and when his country collapsed and surrendered to Nazi Germany, De Gaulle fled to England. In France, as in most countries, promotions to that level must be approved by the government, but France's government had gone the way of the Dodo, so De Gaulle just 'forgot' to tell anyone that his high rank was not official. De Gaulle set about becoming the de facto French leader in England by driving Winston Churchill crazy.   Churchill kept De Gaulle busy by giving him control of the 1st Free French division which was made up of whatever flotsam and jetsam the British leader could dig up or have released from prison early. De Gaulle was kept away from any real war plans as the Allied leaders sent him and his band of criminals here and there, usually somewhere in a flank position because anywhere else 'General' De Gaulle got in the way of the real soldiers.  De Gaulle drove General Eisenhower to distraction. De Gaulle was never happy that the American general was chosen to be the supreme commander in Europe. De Gaulle, of course, felt that honor should be his. The free world can thank God everyday that De Gaulle was not leading anything. He was consulted out of political respect and the knowledge that he would probably lead France after the war but that was the only reason. De Gaulle felt D-Day would be a disaster and would never be successful. That was just one just one in a long string of De Gaulle's opinions that were wrong.  After the Allied forces liberated France, De Gaulle was allowed to 'liberate' Paris with his nonexistent army. This man, with his supreme ego, probably believed he really did liberate Paris. It was all political, of course, and General Patton was left grinding his teeth over the slight.  General George Patton, a great general known to be a little pompous himself, said he would rather have a battalion of Germans in front of him than a battalion of French behind him. Patton had a big mouth, but at least he had the skills in warfare to back up his ego.   De Gaulle did become the leader of France after World War II and in the 1960's decided French soil could no longer stand having American soldiers standing on it so he pulled out of the military branch of NATO and ordered all American troops out of France. An angry President Johnson asked De Gaulle if he wanted us to dig up our dead and remove them as well. The story goes that a sputtering De Gaulle told him he didn't mean THOSE American soldiers.  In the here and now, Chirac proudly carries on the French anti-American tradition. However, Chirac has taken it to new heights. Saddam Hussein was a longtime good friend of Chirac, and Saddam thought right up until the first bomb dropped that his good friend in France would keep him safe from the Americans. Saddam should have known that the French always promise more then they can deliver.   As irritating as France's active support of Saddam was prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the revelation that France, along with Germany and Russia and the United Nations were lining their pockets off the blood of Iraqi children does not seem to fall into the category of 'friend and ally.' The fact that our soldiers have been killed with weapons sold to Saddam by France and other 'friends' is more than irritating, it's infuriating - considering the current attitude of the French Government.   The latest insult was Chirac's refusal to attend President Ronald Reagan's funeral. Already in the States for the G-8 conference, Chirac flatly refused to attend the funeral and, at first, was not even going to send a representative. After some protests from the French press, Chirac decided to send an underling. Could it be that Chirac is jealous of Reagan for doing what France could not? Reagan brought down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union - something the mighty French thought was impossible.  Admit it. The average American would just like to smack Chirac every time his face is shown on the television screen. Chirac and the French use the U.N. to hang on to what little power France has left, and the fact the United States can survive quite nicely without any help from France just drives the French crazy. How dare the United States be so darn successful!   As France's economy tanks, the United States economy grows. As the French military perfects the art of surrender, our military doesn't know the meaning of the word. As 'new Europe' looks to the United States for guidance - and not France - its pride is hurt. Didn't the world get the memo from God stating that France should be the leader of the world?   The world seems to have missed that memo - or read it, laughed, and threw it away.

Jean Ziegler, the United Nations' special expert on the right to food, said he forwarded a letter to Caterpillar chief executive James Owen expressing concern 'about the actions of the Israeli occupation forces in Rafah and in other locations in Gaza and the West Bank.'  According to The AP, Ziegler said his letter was the first under a new resolution passed earlier this year by the 53-country UN Human Rights Commission extending responsibility for protecting rights beyond governments to 'non-state actors.'   Ziegler wrote to Owen under the letterhead of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overall UN watchdog, and sent his letter on his own as he is entitled to do, a spokesman said.   The Israelis are 'using armoured bulldozers supplied by your company to destroy agricultural farms, greenhouses, ancient olive groves and agricultural fields planted with crops,' the May 28 letter said.   Ziegler, a Swiss university professor, told The Associated Press that he had yet to receive a response from the company.   'Allowing the delivery of your D-9 and D-10 Caterpillar bulldozers to the Israeli army through the government of the United States in the certain knowledge that they are being used for such actions might involve complicity or acceptance on the part of your company to actual and potential violations of human rights, including the right to food,' Ziegler wrote in his letter.   The Israelis have also used the bulldozers to destroy 'numerous Palestinian homes and sometimes human lives, including that of the American peace activist Rachel Corrie,' he said.   Ziegler, appointed by the UN Human Rights Commission, said after a 10-day visit to Gaza and the West Bank last year that Israel was confiscating fertile Palestinian land for military zones or Jewish settlements.   'We saw thousands of olive trees destroyed by bulldozers,' he said.

'Be assured that the kingdom has enough men whom you haven't seen so far, but within the coming few days you will see them,' Crown Prince Abdullah told the militants, whose attacks have increased during the past three months. His remarks were televised.  Westerners in Saudi Arabia are responding to the attacks by moving to high-security compounds or even to Bahrain, and by pushing for the right to armed private guards, according to diplomats and real estate agents.  Western embassies in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, are negotiating with the government for a relaxation of the ban on private security guards carrying firearms, a Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Some Westerners have expressed concern that terrorist sympathizers may have infiltrated the Saudi security services, the diplomat said.  Security forces arrested a militant Tuesday north of Riyadh as they stepped up their presence in and around the city in a hunt for the kidnappers of Paul Johnson, an American who was abducted Saturday by a group calling itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  Security officials said the militant was detained in the King Fahd district, but it was not immediately clear whether the detainee was connected to the recent terror attacks.  Johnson, 49, of Stafford Township, N.J., was employed by Lockheed Martin and worked on Apache helicopters.   Third Westerner Killed  The day he was seized, Islamic militants shot dead another American, Kenneth Scroggs, from Laconia, N.H., in his garage. Scroggs was the third Westerner killed in a week, after the shooting death of an Irish cameraman for the British Broadcasting Corp. on June 6 and another American who was killed in his garage June 8.  Soldiers with automatic rifles guarded government buildings and manned check points in the city on Tuesday. Other security forces were searching houses where Johnson might be held, a Saudi official said, speaking on a condition of anonymity.  The Interior Ministry set up a hot line to receive information about Johnson or possible terrorist attacks.  In his appearance on television, the crown prince addressed a group of writers, intellectuals and clerics, urging them to take a proactive position against Islamic militancy.  'What is required from you as brothers, as clerics, as writers, is not to be silent,' Abdullah said. 'Silence is a crime against your religion, against your country and against your people.'  The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh has advised Americans to leave Saudi Arabia, and Britain has authorized the voluntary departure of its nonessential embassy staff and their families.  'There is no overcrowding at consulates and there is no panic among Westerners to leave,' a Western diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  An estimated 35,000 Americans have been working in Saudi Arabia. It was not clear how many have left since the terror attacks became more frequent in April. Western diplomats said Monday that Americans and others were leaving in response to the violence, but that it could not be described as an exodus.  A real estate agent in Riyadh told The Associated Press that Westerners were moving from parts of the capital seen as less secure to walled compounds and upscale neighborhoods with greater security.  'They will feel safer as more security forces are deployed (in those areas),' the real estate agent said, speaking on a condition of anonymity.  Foreigners who work in the oil industry, and live on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia, have even crossed international borders to sleep soundly.  'Foreigners working in the oil industry have been renting houses in neighboring Bahrain,' a second real estate agent told the AP. 'They finish their work and come back the next day.'  Bahrain is just a 30-minute drive across the 18-mile King Fahd Causeway from eastern Saudi Arabia.

Both measures grew out of events in Iraq, where some American companies have been accused of overcharging the government for goods and services, and where employees of private companies have been implicated in the prison abuse scandal.  Opponents said the proposals could disrupt military operations in Iraq and impair American intelligence and supply efforts. The plan to bar private interrogators within 90 days and translators within a year was rejected on a 54-43 vote; the tougher criminal penalties - of as much as 20 years – were defeated 52-46. If adopted, both would have been added to a major Pentagon bill now being debated in the Senate.  Senators approved an alternative Republican plan to extend current domestic antifraud laws to those operating overseas and, on a voice vote, adopted a declaration that those held in American custody should not be subject to torture.   Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he feared the proposal to allow jail terms of up to 20 years for those found to have 'materially overvalued' goods and services could deter companies from seeking work in Iraq. He said such a step required more consideration.  'I think the Congress should deliberate very carefully a criminal penalty of up to 20 years for these thousands upon thousands of companies that are currently engaged,' he said.  But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said current prohibitions did not seem to deter companies from charging excessive prices. 'We constantly pick up the paper about a number of these companies that are obviously overcharging and nothing is happening to them,'' he said. 'I am one frustrated American and would like them to stop.'

The analysis found that 27 of the measures had little or nothing to do with tackling terrorism including measures to do with crime in general and the surveillance of telecommunications (phone-calls, e-mails, faxes, internet usage) and of movement. This strategy begs the question whether there is, at the highest level, a confusion of aims and effort.  The Action Plans for the Summit (from the Council of the Europe Union and the European Commission) are peppered with references to a Commission Communication dated 29 March 2004, which is a classic demonstration of confused aims. This contains a proposal for a Council Decision on exchanging 'information and cooperation concerning terrorists offences' (see below) and a 'wish-list' on criminal matters. The logic is to bring together the: 'Union's arsenal of weapons against terrorism. Many of these are not specifically anti-terrorism but range wider while including terrorism [and] a link should be established between terrorism and other forms of crime' [even though these are] not always immediately obvious..if the fight against terrorism is to be totally effective, it must be handled in conjunction with the fight against other forms of crime.'  It argues that the connection is, in part, through the use of 'similar' methods and proposes everybody’s (convicted criminal or not) bank accounts should be 'registered' and 'be accessible to law enforcement agencies'. Companies and charitable organisations too are to be targeted because they could be 'infiltrated' by terrorists. Everyone, across whole spheres of everyday life, are to registered and recorded to try and track down terrorist 'suspects' - of course, the same information - once collected and accessible to a host of state agencies - could equally be used for other purposes which have nothing to do with terrorism.  The big project is the proposed creation of a 'European Criminal Record' to be held on a 'European Criminal Registry' - which according to a Commission spokesperson would contain not only all convictions and disqualifications but also all charges brought (even of those found innocent at trial) from the whole of the EU - in 'the fight against crime, and in particular terrorism'.  The simplistic notion in the Commission Communication is that there is an intrinsic link between terrorism and organised crime and indeed all crime - an argument which, if turned around, implies that all crime is linked to terrorism.  Framework Decision: exchanging information  The specific proposal in the Communication is a draft Council Decision on 'the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences'. This envisages in Article 2 the exchange of 'information' during investigations and prosecutions concerning terrorist offences as set out in Article 1 to 3 of the 2002 Framework Decision on combating terrorism. The 'information' is to be communicated to Europol and Eurojust (EU prosecutors) and made 'available immediately to the authorities of other interested Member States'.  It is sensible that such information should be made available. However, the proposal contains no provision for the 'information' to be removed/deleted should a person be found innocent. There is no provision for the 'information' passed over on those caught up in a 'criminal investigation' but never charged or convicted to be removed/deleted. This is especially worrying as an 'investigation' into a suspected terrorist offence would embrace not just the subject but their family, friends and work associates to see if there were any links to the suspected offence. A typical investigation could involve 20-40 other people who are found to be quite innocent but 'information' on them could be 'immediately' transmitted to dozens of agencies across the 25 EU member states.  In April ten Muslim 'suspects' were arrested in the north of England but never charged - this could have led to several hundred names and personal details being put into EU-wide circulation with no obligation for this data to be deleted. If there is no obligation to delete the names and details of innocent people they could find themselves on 'watch-lists' for years to come.  There is another problem with the draft Decision. The intention is to widen the scope from those persons, groups and entities placed on updated lists of terrorist groups on formally adopted EU lists to all those investigated under Articles 1 to 3 of the controversial Framework Decision on combating terrorism (2002) which, despite some amendment, is still ambiguous as to where the line is drawn between terrorism and large-scale protests. It covers, for example, those acting with the aim of: unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act (Art 1.ii)  To broaden the scope of cooperation on terrorism to this much broader definition open the way for abuse and its application to non-terrorist offences.   Comment:  'The increasing tendency to stress the 'anti-terrorist' benefits of crime control and wholesale surveillance measures shows a confusion of aims which detracts from the clear need to protect people from terrorist attacks. This has to be one of the most confused and illogical Commission Communications ever produced. It should be withdrawn and be re-presented and deal only with investigations into terrorist offences - and include absolute safeguards for those innocently caught up in them.'

Know your enemy.    Well, the principal that holds for military warfare holds true for digital warfare, as well. But it's not like black hat hackers are having lunch with security administrators and sharing their secrets for intrusions and hybrid worm attacks. So how do you figure out who your enemy is and what he's trying to do to your network?   The answers lie in the honeypot. According to members of the Honeynet Project and the Honeynet Research Alliance, most of what you need to know about hackers can be found there. Their new collaborative book, Know Your Enemy: Learning About Security Threats looks at honeypots, honeynets and what they can teach us about the bad guys, as well as how to successfully set them up yourself.   Honeypots, which have been around for about 12 years but are gaining interest and momentum, are digital decoys, of sorts. They are built to be probed and attacked -- an online come-on to blackhat hackers. Once the honeypot is attacked, security administrators can watch how the hacker moves around the system, and she can see what tools the hacker is using and what information he's going after.    It's a way to spy on your enemy.    And if you're lucky, it might even be a form of camouflage. Hackers could be fooled into thinking they've accessed a corporate network, when actually they're just banging around in a honeypot - while the real network remains safe and sound.   There also are honeynets, which are a network of honeypots, loaded up with real hardware, like Linux boxes, Cisco switches, Windows NT and Solaris. Lance Spitzner, a senior security architect at Sun Microsystems Inc., created the Honeynet Project with the help of about 30 other security professionals.   Spitzner is one of the authors of the book Know Your Enemy. He talked about what they've learned about hackers, what companies should be doing to better protect themselves, and if putting together a honeypot or a honeynet is the right thing for most companies.   There also are honeynets, which are a network of honeypots, loaded up with real hardware, like Linux boxes, Cisco switches, Windows NT and Solaris. Lance Spitzner, an engineer at Sun Microsystems Inc., created the Honeynet Project with the help of about 30 other security professionals.    Q:  Are honeypots and honeynets the best way to learn about hackers?   It's definitely one of the best ways. You get to watch them operate in their own environment. It's difficult to survey hackers or talk with them... With a honeynet, you can watch and analyze what they're doing without them knowing they're being watched. What tools do they use? What systems are they going after? Who are they communicating with?    Q:  What are some of the more interesting things you've learned about hackers? The attackers and threats are far more aggressive and active than most people think. The typical home user, if they have a dedicated connection to the Internet, is getting scanned about 10 times a day. People think they only go after major companies, but they go after everyone.   And people think of hacker terrorism but most hackers are just criminals. They're out to make money. There are so many creative ways to make money hacking computers. They can go online and take information, like addresses and social security numbers, off peoples' computers. Then they can use the information or sell it. They might even break into hundreds or thousands of computers and sell these hacked computers to someone else. They might set up a porn site on your computer and charge people to go see it.    Q:  What changes have you seen in how hackers operate? There have been two big changes. In '97, '98 or '99, you'd see the misguided youth. But in past few years, there's been a switch to the criminal. People are out to make money. Tools are far more aggressive and automated. It makes for a different level of sophistication.    Q:  What should administrators and CSOs know about your findings? Stay with the basics. People try to go for the latest and greatest. If you're running a current and patched operating system, you should be protected. Anti-virus software and firewalls will go a long way to eliminating most threats. It's not that hackers have super secret weapons. They're trying to look for mistakes in your environment. They look for simple passwords or systems that aren't patched. With 20 percent effort, you can eliminate 80 percent of the threat.    Q:  Should companies be running their own honeypots or honeynets? Commercial organizations? Probably not. Do the basics. If you're having problems with patching and such, you shouldn't have a honeynet. If you've got all the basics done, sure. Go ahead. Get a honeynet because you can learn a lot. But academics, military and government run most honeynets. Stick to what you have to do first. Once you've got the basics down, honeynets can give you a lot of information, maybe even on internal threats.    Q:  What should companies do to protect themselves that they're generally not doing? Companies are not doing the basics. Most want to pass audit. They want to be able to tell shareholders that they're secure... In a lot of cases, you hear about companies being taken out by worms. These exploits have been known for six months and the patches have been out for six months. That means these companies haven't patched their systems in six months. That's just blowing it on the basics.

Concern over this notwithstanding, Malaysia and Indonesia are fiercely opposed to US policing of the body of water that lies between them. They have, however, signaled interest in cooperating with Washington on certain issues to enhance maritime security in this strategic waterway.   The terrorist threat to the Malacca Straits topped the agenda at a recent high-level conference in Singapore, which saw a narrowing in the gap between the positions of the United States and Singapore on the one hand and Malaysia and Indonesia on the other, with regard to measures to step up security in the Straits.  In March, Admiral Thomas Fargo, head of the US Pacific Command, put forward in Congress an initiative to work with Southeast Asian countries to protect the Malacca Straits. The Regional Maritime Security Initiative that Fargo outlined envisaged mutual intelligence gathering and joint patrolling of the waterway. Fargo indicated that the initiative would involve US elite troops who could 'take action when the decision has been made to do so'.  While Singapore embraced the initiative, Malaysia and Indonesia rejected the proposal as an infringement of their sovereignty. 'I think we can look after our own area,' Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the media last month. At the conference, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak, who also serves as defense minister, said the use of US forces in Southeast Asia to fight terrorism would fuel Islamic fanaticism in the region and should be avoided as it would be a setback in the region's ideological battle against extremism and militancy.  Subsequently, Razak told the Malay-language Mingguan Malaysia newspaper: 'The presence of foreign troops in our waters would trigger public anger and breathe new life into terrorist groups.'  Articulating the Indonesian position on the proposed deployment of US forces, Nugroho Wisnumurti, a former director general for political affairs in the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote in April in the Jakarta Post that the deployment of foreign marines and special operations forces in Indonesia's territorial waters could harm the country's national interests” even if the aim is to fight terrorism'. He also pointed out that 'the deployment of foreign forces in our territory, including in our territorial waters', would run counter to 'one of the basic principles of Indonesian foreign policy, the policy of non-alignment'.  'However well intentioned that plan might be, the US plan would not serve the best interests of the countries concerned in fostering regional cooperation to fight terrorism. There should be other ways to reach the same objectives. It is also desirable that the countries concerned should be consulted before any effort to fight terrorism in Southeast Asia is made public,' the former diplomat wrote. Singapore, in contrast, had no reservations over the involvement of the Americans in policing the Straits. And Singapore will also work with India, South Korea and other nations to enhance security in the Straits. Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said this week: 'One of the major issues which we will discuss with South Korea is involvement by South Koreans in maritime security. The Singapore armed forces has interactions with the Korean military from time to time. We hope to expand and deepen these interactions.'  Connecting the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, the Malacca Straits are one of the busiest ocean highways in the world. An estimated 50,000 ships are said to pass through the waterway a year - more than double the number that crosses the Suez Canal and nearly three times the number of ships that use the Panama Canal.  A terrorist strike in the 630-mile-long Malacca Straits would severely dislocate world trade for months. A quarter of the world's commerce passes through this waterway, including 10 million barrels of crude oil heading daily from the Persian Gulf toward China, South Korea and Japan.  About 80 percent of Japan's oil passes through the Malacca Straits. Closure of the Straits in the event of a terrorist attack would require ships to travel an additional 994 miles from the Gulf. Freight rates would increase sharply. In all, the Straits accounts for a third of the world's trade and half of the world's oil supply.  The security situation in the Malacca Straits has always been a matter of concern. For centuries, it has been a haven for pirates. It is a narrow waterway - just 1.5 miles wide at its narrowest point. Choking the Straits by blowing up a ship would not be difficult. Besides, its shallow reefs, innumerable islets and the slow movement of ships thanks to the heavy traffic in the waterway provide the perfect environment for pirates and terrorists to operate, making it a tempting target.  Maritime piracy in the Malacca Straits has witnessed a sharp increase in recent years. Worldwide, it has increased by three times in the past decade, growing by 20% last year alone. According to the International Maritime Bureau, Southeast Asia witnessed 189 incidents of piracy last year, accounting for more than 40% of the global total.  Terrorism experts point out that if pirates were able to strike with such ease in the Straits, terrorists would find it even easier. Analysts are warning that al-Qaeda and its affiliates in the region, such as Jemaah Islamiya, might take the help of local pirates to carry out an attack in the Malacca Straits.  A recent spurt in crew abductions in the Straits has triggered fear that pirates acting in concert with terrorists might be using the kidnapped crew to acquire training in navigating large commercial vessels. In March 2003, 10-armed men hijacked an Indonesian chemical tanker.  They seized control over the ship apparently to learn to steer it. After operating the ship for an hour through the Straits, they left with equipment and technical documents. 'This might be the maritime equivalent to the Florida flight school where the September 11 [2001] terrorists took their flying lessons,' observed the Washington-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security (IAGS).  Security agencies are not ruling out the possibility of terrorists capturing a vessel loaded with liquid natural gas and slamming it into a pier in Singapore or ramming tugboats into oil tankers or vessels with chemical fertilizer.  Sections who are in favor of the Americans playing a bigger role in the Straits question whether the littoral states will be able to counter a terrorist attack on their own. The IAGS observed: 'Despite claims by Indonesian naval officers that their navy is able to provide sufficient response to the security problems in the region, many naval experts think otherwise. The Indonesian navy is aging and suffers from lack of warships and resources to patrol its vast coastline and the periphery of some 17,000 islands. Of its 117 naval ships, comprising 14 warships, 57 patrol boats and 44 support vessels such as tankers and carriers, only 30 percent are seaworthy.  'With such insufficient maritime power, it is clear that Indonesia simply cannot secure the 600-mile Straits alone, but its fear of any perceived challenge to its sovereignty as well as its concern of American 'imperialism' apparently overrides military logic,' said the IAGS.  At the Singapore conference, the US position on the maritime security initiative was a watered-down version of the plan outline by Fargo in March. US officials said it was up to concerned countries - not the United States - to decide how they wanted to police the Malacca Straits.  'It will not be US forces that do that. It will not be US forces coming down unnecessarily and doing anything aggressive,' said Admiral Walter Doran, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, adding that there were also no plans for 'bases, or standing forces'.  There was a visible toning-down in Malaysia's position as well. While it continued to maintain that involvement of foreign forces would prove counterproductive, it indicated that it was willing to discuss the regional maritime security initiative. 'We should definitely expand our cooperation with the US and others, in terms of acquiring and sharing quality intelligence,' Malaysia's deputy prime minister said.  He is due to meet Fargo this month, when he will be discussing among other things 'possible exercises, in the form of specific anti-piracy or anti-terrorist type of operations which, maybe, some countries are more familiar with and more experienced in than us'.  However, Razak stressed that 'the actual interdiction, if it comes to that, would come to the littoral states to execute'.  Malaysia, meanwhile, will next year have its own version of the US Coast Guard to patrol and safeguard security along the Straits. A new paramilitary maritime enforcement agency will begin its operations in March, said Mohd Nazri Abdul Aziz, a minister in the Prime Minister's Department.  Mohd Nazri said that the agency would administer laws, curb criminal activities, monitor the maritime zone and rescue and research operations and assist the Malaysian armed forces during emergencies, crises or wars.  'The safety of the Straits of Malacca is important. If not guarded properly, foreign powers may be prone to intervene in its management, and this will pose a threat to the country's sovereignty,' he said.  Currently, maritime enforcement laws are administered in a sectorial manner by 11 government departments and agencies involving 5,000 personnel and more than 400 vessels. Initially, the new agency will have 82 small and medium-sized boats and will take over assets from the various agencies in stages.  The narrowing of the gap in the positions between the various countries concerned with security in the Malacca Straits augurs well for the global effort to tackle maritime terrorism. The question is whether the concerned countries will get their acts together soon enough. Japan has also expressed interest in taking part in any talks on maritime security in the Malacca Straits.  US heavy-handedness and insensitivity to local concerns of sovereignty and national pride have contributed in significant measure to the failure of the 'war on terrorism' to achieve its goals. If the war on maritime terrorism should succeed, this would have to change.   Comment  - Singapore, in contrast, had no reservations over the involvement of the Americans in policing the Straits. And Singapore will also work with India, South Korea and other nations to enhance security in the Straits. Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said this week: 'One of the major issues which we will discuss with South Korea is involvement by South Koreans in maritime security. The Singapore armed forces has interactions with the Korean military from time to time. We hope to expand and deepen these interactions. LuisB'  Source;  Asia Times Online Ltd.

'Stop the hypocrisy!' he demanded in Dutch as news crews scrambled behind the scenes to regain control. It was the 16th anniversary of the first intifada, and Azzuz had a message: 'Israel must vanish,' he said, his voice calm and even. 'The killings of Palestinians must cease.'   When he had finished speaking, he calmly thanked the audience, rolled up his flag, and walked away. The whole episode took less than two minutes. Police were called, but lacking sufficient grounds for his arrest, he says, they simply gave him a ride home.  Azzuz is a Founder and the Belgian President of the Arab European League, or AEL, an outspoken self-styled civil rights movement with a growing membership - and growing influence - in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and beyond. Combining Arab nationalism with impassioned Islamism, it positions itself as an uncompromising defender of European Muslims, eschewing assimilation and espousing confrontational political ideas such as the introduction of sharia law in Europe. It has warned of - or threatened - an 'almost unpreventable' attack on Antwerp's Jewish community if it does not 'cancel its support for Jewish policy as fast as possible and distance itself from the state of Israel.' (Azzuz's 'Stop the hypocrisy' was a reference to those Belgian Jews who, he claims, join the Israeli army, which he sees as proof that Belgium is biased toward Israel.)  More recently, the Dutch faction of the League issued an invitation to Pakistani extremist Hussain Ahmed, leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a group with known ties to al-Qaida and the Taliban, to speak at a congress center in the Netherlands. (Dutch officials subsequently refused to grant Ahmed an entry visa, citing national security concerns; the AEL blamed 'the Zionist lobby' for the decision.) The AEL has issued public approvals of 9/11, pledged solidarity with Iraqi insurgents and has challenged new French measures to ban Muslim headscarves in public schools.  Had Azzuz used his guerrilla TV tactic at an American network, it would have been national news - and he might still be in detention. In Europe, however, Azzuz's piece of political theater aroused less outrage - in part because Europe, home to some 15 million Muslims, is struggling to figure out how to deal with the militancy of small but growing groups like the Arab European League without trampling on civil rights, and without alienating more moderate Muslims who are by far the bigger bloc.  To its defenders, the league is an uncompromising advocate for European Muslims, in the tradition of American blacks and Latinos who aggressively called for recognition in the '60s. But to its critics, including some fellow Muslims, the league and its charismatic leader, Dyab Abou Jahjah, are a divisive and potentially destructive force, so provocative that some Belgian officials have sought to knock its Web site offline or even to have the group banned outright. In the wake of the March terror bombings in Spain and a pair of controversial new reports linking anti-Semitic acts in Europe to Muslim immigrants, Jahjah, Azzuz and their league allies are coming under closer law enforcement scrutiny and increasing political pressure.  Just before the Madrid attacks, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service disclosed in a report that the number of Muslim immigrants in that country being recruited by international jihadists had increased. Pinpointing groups like the AEL, the report warned 'a violent radical Islamic movement is gradually taking root in the Dutch society.' (The Dutch government has just learned that it could be targeted by al-Qaida, in part because of the radicalization of Muslims in the Netherlands, according to press reports. Spanish and Italian intelligence have reportedly heard on phone taps that a terrorist group is 'standing by' in Holland.) And in a report by the European Union's Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia issued March 31, researchers found that young Muslims were the biggest force behind a wave of anti-Semitic incidents and attacks in Europe since 2001.  Far from apologizing, Jahjah and other league leaders have seemed to draw energy from conflict and controversy. The league has largely declined to condemn a wave of anti-Semitic acts by Muslim youth. League officials have offered no public criticism of the March 11 Madrid train bombings that left nearly 200 dead and hundreds more injured. (Authorities believe a Moroccan terrorist cell carried out the attack with ties to al-Qaida). Instead, Jahjah suggested in a televised debate that a similar attack was likely in the Netherlands. 'It's logical,' he said. 'You make war with us, we make war with you.'  Despite their confrontational stance, AEL leaders insist that they advocate only peaceful methods of change: Jahjah has declared, 'We are against violence.' But their stance is ambiguous. One line from the AEL manifesto asserts: 'You don't receive equal rights: you take them.' And the league's Web site praises Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, who along with seven bystanders was assassinated in March by Israel in a missile attack. Yassin, the site said, is 'an example for many of us.'  Somali-born Dutch Parliamentarian Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a former Muslim whose outspoken criticism of Islam's treatment of women has made her the target of death threats from Muslims around the world, blasted this statement in a March 27 Op-Ed in the Dutch newspaper de Trouw. 'A terrorist leader with the blood of hundreds on his hands is evidently a source of inspiration for the young men and women of the AEL,' she wrote.  Jahjah stirred more controversy in an open letter to U.S. President George W. Bush.  'Mr. President,' the letter reads, 'we are a peaceful people, we do not attack unless we are attacked, we do not kill unless we are killed, and we do not aggress, we defend. If you want peace, you and your people, there is only one way, and that is the way out of our land.' But if the U.S. continues its close backing of Israel and 'the Zionists,' Jahjah warns, and persists with its 'aggression and occupation troops in Faloudja, in Baghdad, in Nadjaf, in Gaza and Jerusalem and Ramallah ... more and more of your soldiers will undoubtedly rest in peace.'  It is the sort of rhetoric that has come to define the self-described 'Arabian panther.' Eloquent, charismatic and Hollywood handsome - think George Clooney meets Robert de Niro - the 32-year-old Jahjah founded the Arab European League in Belgium in 2000, before the 9/11 attacks. Born in Lebanon and now a citizen of Belgium, he is part Malcolm X and part rock star. His makes no attempt to conceal his goal: He wants to introduce sharia - the religious laws and codes of Islam - to form what he calls a 'sharocracy' in Europe. The sale of alcohol in grocery stores would be banned, as would sexually suggestive advertising. Islamic holidays would become national holidays, like Christmas.  Jahjah has spoken of the Sept. 11 attacks as 'sweet revenge,' though the Dutch newsweekly HP/de Tijd quoted him as saying he would prefer to have seen empty planes crash the Pentagon and the White House. 'I'd have found that quite beautiful,' he said.  Jahjah and his followers vehemently insist that Middle Eastern immigrants and their children must preserve their own culture and religion; comparing assimilation to 'fascism' and 'rape,' Jahjah demands that the cultural and religious traditions of Middle Eastern immigrants and their children be not just preserved but integrated into the culture of the West. 'I'd rather die than assimilate,' Jahjah has said.  When asked by a Belgian television reporter if terrorism or a revolution were possible in the Lowlands, he offered a curt reply: 'With the AEL, it could very well happen.'  Jahjah and the AEL burst into the headlines in November 2002, when Moroccan youths (Belgians of Moroccan descent are simply called 'Moroccans') looted shops, threw stones, smashed cars and staged a three-day standoff with police after a psychologically disturbed Belgian shot and killed a young Muslim teacher on the streets of Antwerp for no apparent reason. Belgian officials blamed Abou Jahjah. Though Jahjah insisted his only part in the event was trying to calm everybody down, police arrested him after the chaos had subsided and thoroughly searched his home. The AEL called this proof of Belgium's ongoing vendetta against their movement; Belgian lawmakers contended that Jahjah posed a danger to the community of Antwerp. Jahjah was released after an Antwerp court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to hold him.  Either way, the arrest propelled his name and the league's cause into the international arena. To some, he was a celebrity radical, an alluring combination of sex symbol and martyr; the Belgian media frequently called him the 'black angel of integration.'  That was hardly the first brush with notoriety for the league. In April 2002, enraged by Israel's massive military assault into the West Bank in response to a Palestinian terrorist attack, Moroccans and AEL members smashed the storefronts of Jewish-owned shops, calling for jihad and chanting 'Osama bin Laden!' Before the U.S. invaded Iraq a little over a year ago, league members hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails during anti-American demonstrations staged at the Antwerp harbor.  In 2003, almost a year after Pim Fortuyn's assassination, the league opened a Dutch chapter; soon after, Mohammed Cheppih was appointed to head it. But earlier statements from Cheppih supporting suicide bombers in Palestine and the death penalty for homosexuals provoked such an outcry that he was forced to step down. Still, he remains an influential consultant to the league.  Today, behind a motto that is early Malcolm X - 'by any means necessary' - the Arab European League reports steady growth, with members now in 12 countries. In Holland, it says, membership has surged from 200 in March 2003 to about 1,000 now. A new office has opened in France, and last summer, the league deployed a new political wing, the Muslim Democratic Party, to represent its views in European Parliamentary elections this year.  For its adherents, the AEL offers a united platform and an amplified voice. This is especially true for the second- and third-generation children of immigrants who came here - primarily from Turkey and Morocco - as guest workers in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, kids struggling to define their identity in a post-9/11 and increasingly nationalistic Europe. The children and even the grandchildren of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants are still considered 'Turkish' or 'Moroccan,' rather than Dutch or Belgian. To these boys, Jahjah is a role model, a hero; for girls, he is a star. One newspaper quoted a young girl saying to Jahjah's bodyguards outside a talk he gave in Holland: 'I just want to see him in the real.'  In person and via the league's Web site, Jahjah speaks directly to these disenfranchised youth. He is deeply mistrustful of the Western press, arguing that no matter what he says, he will be misquoted or that “the Zionist lobby” will twist his words in an effort to turn popular opinion against him. Non-Muslim reporters are barred from Jahjah's lectures and speeches, and he pointedly ignored Salon's several attempts to reach him. Other AEL officers rarely speak to non-Muslim members of the press.  However, Jahjah's Belgian lieutenant, Azzuz, agreed to an interview in December, after a series of protests that led to the arrest of 10 league members - including some who hung the Palestinian flag over the Dutch Parliament building in The Hague and Azzuz's own television caper. Speaking by phone from Antwerp, the 27-year-old Belgian AEL leader, the son of Moroccan immigrants, was cordial but direct. The deaths of 9/11 were 'collateral damage' - a term, he says, that Muslims learned from Americans. 'Finally, something had happened to those who kill our women and children,' he said of the terror strikes that have reshaped world politics. 'But America still blames others. They didn't learn their lesson at all.' What lesson is that? 'Stop supporting the terrorist state of Israel,' Azzuz replied. George Bush 'doesn't hold the strings,' he says, the Zionists do.  Relations between the peoples of the West and the Middle East have deteriorated to such a point, Azzuz said, that 'something like Sept. 11 is likely to happen again.'  Belgium is a world capital of the diamond industry; it is a small but powerful engine of European capitalism, a bastion of conservatism and home to a large population of Orthodox Jews. It has long struggled to reconcile the submerged cultural conflicts between its Flemish, or Dutch-speaking, culture and the French-speaking Walloons. Neighboring Holland, by contrast, is a tiny country with a large reputation for liberalism and tolerance. In 'coffeeshops' throughout the country, menu items for 'Colombian' and 'Purple Mountain' refer not to java but to varieties of marijuana; in the winding streets of Amsterdam's red light district, women pose in lingerie before the windows. It is here that same-sex marriage and doctor-assisted euthanasia were first made legal.  But the two countries share a common dynamic: As their Muslim populations have grown larger and more restive, both have spawned a sometimes-fierce anti-immigrant backlash. The result has been a cycle of building hostilities between Muslim and European in which it is usually impossible to tell who threw the first stone.  The influx of Muslims into Holland, Belgium and the other nations of Europe is hardly new. Tens of thousands have arrived, mostly from Turkey and Morocco, since the 1960s and 1970s. Those in the first wave, like immigrants everywhere, often came looking for political freedom and economic opportunity. Even now, though, the grandchildren of those immigrants say they often feel like second-class citizens in the countries they call home. The immigrants' levels of education are generally lower; for them and their children, unemployment rates are higher. In Belgium, unemployment among Muslims is estimated at up to 40 percent.  Still, the population of Muslims in Europe continues to grow. According to one recent report, it could nearly double by 2015, approaching 30 million.  Almost a million Muslims now live in the Netherlands, giving the country the second-highest Muslim population per capita in Europe, after France. In a country still coming to grips with its guilt over the large numbers of Jews deported during the Nazi occupation more than 60 years ago, many are reluctant to discriminate against a different religious group, even if that group stands opposed to Holland's famed liberal and secular mores.  But after some Dutch Moroccans openly celebrated the 9/11 attacks, and after a radical imam in Rotterdam pronounced that 'homosexuals are pigs,' many among the Dutch were pushed over the brink. The rightist sociology professor Pim Fortuyn rose suddenly to political prominence, inaugurating his own party which he led into Parliamentary elections. Fortuyn, a gay man, ripped Islam as a 'backward culture' and called for tough new curbs on immigration. Though he was assassinated in the spring of 2002, his party swept to power with considerable support from voters under 30. Though Fortuyn's party did not hold power long, its powerful influence is still felt in strict new immigration rules and the planned deportation of 26,000 failed asylum-seekers.  The rise of far-right parties like Lijst Pim Fortuyn and Belgium's Vlaams Blok and the popularity of right-wing leaders like France's Jean-Marie le Pen has made European Muslims feel increasingly unwelcome, even hated.  'People are getting angry,' says Ayhan Tonca, chairman of Holland's largest organization of Turkish mosques.  The international political climate in recent years has further eroded tolerance and goodwill on both sides. The bloody Israeli-Palestinian conflict has inflamed Muslim animosity toward the West, a rage fueled by Arab news stations and Internet sites that beam graphic news and propaganda into Muslim homes throughout the West, thousands of miles from the zones of conflict.  In that atmosphere, the rhymes Moroccan youth chant beneath the stormy skies and along the cobbled streets of Holland's Jewish neighborhoods have become frighteningly familiar: 'Hamas, Hamas, alle Joden aan het gas!' they cry. ('Hamas, Hamas, all Jews to the gas!) Or: 'Joden moet je doden!' which translates with chilling simplicity: 'Kill Jews!' On May 4, 2003, during a national moment of silence in remembrance of those who perished in Holocaust, a group of Moroccan boys began playing soccer with the wreath Holland's Queen Beatrix had placed by the Holocaust Memorial at the Palace in Amsterdam. There is an increasing incidence of race-based crimes, such as the recent murder of a teacher by a Turkish student in The Hague. 'The teacher dishonored him,' one friend of the confessed killer, known only as 'Murat D.,' explained to the media as other Turkish classmates chanted, 'Murat, we love you!'  And while Jewish schoolboys in France now leave yarmulkes at home because the law demands it, in Holland, they do so out of fear. Indeed, the Dutch Center for Information and Documentation on Israel reports a 140 percent increase in anti-Semitic acts in the year 2002 and first half of 2003. That number 'omits any act that could be viewed as anti-Israel,' says the center's director, Ronny Naftaniel.  'There were some 330 incidents last year,' says Naftaniel, who estimates that 75 percent were perpetrated by Moroccan youth. 'There is a minimal amount of anti-Semitism that is constant in Holland, of course, but if you blame Jews for being the world power who direct the politics of the world, if you throw stones at Orthodox Jews, if you chant 'Hamas, Hamas' on trams and buses in the cities, that's anti-Semitism, and that's a problem.'  Some Muslim leaders also acknowledge rampant, and often rabid, anti-Semitism in the Muslim communities here; even Jahjah and other AEL officials have, on occasion, spoken against it. But not Naima Elmaslouhi, the Arab European League's vice president in Holland. Speaking briefly by cellphone from the Amsterdam police station in December, as she waited for the release of fellow league officers arrested during a pro-Palestinian demonstration, she said the claims of anti-Semitism are exaggerated. 'It's just one or two incidents,' she said.  Perhaps the clearest expression of who Jahjah is and what he wants comes in his book, 'Tussen 2 Werelden: Roots van Een Vrijheidstrijd,' or 'Between Two Worlds: The Roots of a Freedom Fight.' Published late last year by the prestigious Dutch-Belgian publisher J.M. Meulenhoff, a house known for its strong list of Jewish literature, Jahjah's memoir-cum-manifesto suggests that ambiguity and contradiction are central to his character - and maybe to his strategy.  Born and raised in Hanin, in south Lebanon, Jahjah grew up in the midst of that country's civil war and Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which culminated in the 1982 slaughter in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla, where an Israeli commission of inquiry found that Israeli forces and their commander Ariel Sharon were indirectly responsible for the massacre of at least 800, and perhaps as many as 2,000, Palestinian civilians at the hands of Israel's Christian Phalange allies.  In the early 1990s, at the age of 19, Jahjah traveled to the West; he applied for political asylum in Belgium, telling immigration officials that he'd been a member of the militant Shiite group Hezbollah and was seeking to escape its persecution. When authorities began to question his story, he married a Belgian ex-girlfriend, receiving residency as her spouse. The couple divorced shortly after his papers came through. Since then, he has denied he was a member of Hezbollah, saying he made the story up to get asylum.  The league, Jahjah says in his book, isn't especially radical, but rather a 'healthy, democratic protest organization born of the frustration and disappointment and hurt' of its members, a movement that seeks only equality and freedom. Only action, maintains Jahjah, will produce change. Azzuz agrees, saying that sometimes a bit of civil disobedience is necessary to win attention. 'It's not like we take hostages,' he says. But in another passage, Jahjah's book also contains a somewhat different message: 'Violence is no solution,' he writes, 'but it can open the way to a solution.'  In his book, Jahjah claims people wrongly accuse him of ties to al-Qaida when in fact, he says, it is the AEL that is terrorized. Bodyguards protect him from the many domestic and international organizations that he claims want him dead, including Israel's Mossad. (Israel dismissed the charge as 'laughable.')  But critics see evidence of the league's character not only in what Jahjah says and does, but equally in what he doesn't say:. For instance, neither he nor the AEL condemns al-Qaida. And while it would be unreasonable to blame Jahjah, Azzuz or the Arab European League for the wave of anti-Semitism, they are widely seen as contributing to the climate of rage and polarization, if only by issuing mixed messages.  This impression was strengthened last November, after terrorists suspected of al-Qaida links killed more than 50 people and injured hundreds in four bombings in Turkey - including two bombings at Istanbul synagogues. Some in the AEL did publicly condemn the attacks. But Elmaslouhi, the Dutch league's vice president, voiced 'support and understanding' for the bombers. 'I am against the killing of innocents,' she told the Dutch newspaper Algemeene Dagblad, 'but how do you know who is innocent?'  To some critics, Jahjah, Azzuz and others in the Arab European League seem less interested in multicultural harmony than in hostile separatism. These critics warn that a militant 'Arab pride' movement poses risks that far surpass mere social tension.  The recent report by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service noted that self-styled mujahedin 'purposefully influence members of the Muslim communities in the Netherlands in order to create a polarization in society and to alienate the Muslims from the rest of the population.' The effect, according to the report, is to strengthen their recruitment efforts by 'appealing to the idea that the rights and interests of 'good' Muslims are being violated time and again.' As proof of the potential danger, the report cites the example of two Dutch-Moroccans who were killed in Kashmir while training for jihad.  Such concerns have provoked officials in both Belgium and Holland to wonder whether the Arab European League should be banned. In Belgium, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has called Jahjah a 'threat to society,' though his effort to shut down the AEL on the grounds of 'inciting violence, issuing threats and disturbing the public order' - a move Jahjah ascribed to 'the Zionist lobby' - failed.  But when the AEL posted its statement supporting Hamas founder Yassin on its Dutch-language Web site, motions were filed in the Belgian courts to have the page, if not the entire site, pulled from the Web. While the courts debate, the provider serving the site has cancelled the League's account, forcing it to scramble for another and rebuild essentially from scratch. (The English version of the site remains for the most part intact.)  But some are concerned that banning the league would only send the movement underground, making it even more dangerous. 'At least, it's out there in the open,' says Ayhan Tonca, who heads the organization of Turkish mosques in Holland.  For their part, AEL members accuse European officials of criminalizing their movement and exaggerating the social problems within the Euro-Muslim community. Even if that's true, the increased pressure on the league and allied groups is likely to increase the tension. As with the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and the widening conflict between Islamist groups and the West, it sometimes seems that there is no middle ground.  Tonca, speaking from Holland's Turkish community, says he understands the appeal of the Arab European League, and cautions that Europe has no choice but to accept a cultural evolution. 'We have to accept that Muslims are a part of Europe,' he says. 'It isn't just a Judeo-Christian culture anymore.'  Moroccan-born Mohamed Sini, a Dutch Labor Party official who chairs the organization Islam and Citizenship, calls the league an 'extremist group' that only exacerbates tensions. Tonca, too, accuses Jahjah of being not much different than his opponents - Fortuyn, le Pen, the Vlaams Blok. All, he says, divide in anger rather than unite in peace.  The European establishment is wrestling with similar worries. Last December, the European Union shelved a report that blamed Muslims for the recent wave of anti-Semitism; when a  new draft was issued last month, it blamed neo-Nazi and other racist groups, with Muslims being only a secondary cause – even though the numbers in the report showed that Muslims were in fact behind most of the incidents.  But to those who say that Europe must become a melting pot now in a way that it has not been in modern times, Jahjah and other league members say they're not interested in blending in.  Absorbing the principles and norms of Holland, Belgium and other European democracies, they say, would mean sacrificing their integrity, their identity as Muslims. Rather, they argue, the Judeo-Christian majority of Europe should incorporate Islamic norms and values into its own. 'Europe would be a better, safer place,' a message on the now-defunct Dutch Arab European League Web site proclaimed, 'if it observed the values and the norms of Islam.'  'As a minority group,' says Azzuz, 'we have rights.'  'Idiocy!' Naftaniel snaps in reply. 'Integration doesn't ask that you give up your culture.'  Despite the league's plans to expand its presence in the coming year, especially in France, Naftaniel, Tonca and Sini all maintain that the movement will eventually fall by the wayside. 'They fail to serve the real concerns and interests of [European] Muslims,' Sini says, 'mostly because they blame everyone else for the tensions without looking within themselves.'  But he is nonetheless concerned, both about the AEL's actions and about the responses they engender. 'Extremism,' he warns, 'breeds extremism.'  Tonca likewise worries that Abou Jahjah's call will produce Turkish militants. 'The most dangerous terrorists are those who are well educated in the West,' he notes, 'and I fear that the Muslims who are educated here are becoming radical.'  Separation, Naftaniel says, is not compatible with democracy; coexistence requires collaboration and cooperation. 'If one believes in democracy,' he says, 'then the most challenging thing is to sit down with those who with whom you differ.'  That might be the starting point for détente, but does the league want détente? Its signals have been mixed, at best. Jahjah himself has publicly denounced the chants of 'Hamas, Hamas, alle Joden aan het gas!' Elsewhere, though, he has expressed impatience with talk of peaceful coexistence. 'The days of sharing couscous with a Jew are over,' he told Belgian newspaper De Morgen in April 2002.  Another top league official, apparently distressed by reports that Muslim children in Holland refuse to listen to classes about the Holocaust, wrote in a statement on a league site that the organization is 'against each and every form of discrimination and racism. As Muslims we see the Jews as 'the people of the book' and it is obligatory to fight the hate against these people.' But the statement continues: 'With equal fury the AEL fights Nazism and Zionism.' This association of Israel with Nazism, common these days among European Muslims, is widely seen as a crude and inflammatory form of anti-Semitism.  Which to believe, then - the overtures of peace, or the rhetoric of fury?  In the interest of the vrijheidstrijd, or the freedom fight, Jahjah wraps himself in the mantel of the American revolutionary hero Patrick Henry. 'We seek only to live in peace and with the freedom to live our own lives with equality, appreciation, and respect,' he writes in 'Between Two Worlds.' 'And if anyone tries to remove that right and to oppose us, we will fight until the oppression stops, and we acquire freedom - or die in the attempt.'  Write;  by Abigail R.

"            HIGHLIGHTS    GEOPOLITICA – AFRICA – NAMIBIA   Marathon Congress Drains Emotions   The half moon was above the President's Hall of the Windhoek Show Society, as the elections director announced that Lands Minister Hifikepunye Lucas Pohamba was halfway to becoming President-elect.   Just as Windhoek's street lamps overwhelmed the moonlight, Pohamba needed the votes of nomination contender Nahas Angula to drown out the challenge of former Foreign Affairs Minister Hidipo Hamutenya.  Angula, one of three nominees for the ruling party's presidential candidate in the upcoming national elections, had fallen out in the first round. By the time Pohamba wrapped it up in the early hours of a chilly Sunday morning, the moon had long retired, leaving the twinkling stars to light up the sky for Swapo's congress delegates as they moved celebrations from the Show Grounds to the party's head office in Katutura.  The celebrations seemed less about rejoicing over Pohamba's victory than letting off steam over the events of the preceding week that had raised the tension among the nominees and their supporters. It had been an arduous trip to Swapo's watershed special congress called to select a successor to President Sam Nujoma.   The hour arrives   A sense of trepidation hung in the air as the more than 500 delegates gathered on Friday. After weeks of reports that Nujoma was campaigning against Hamutenya, the President set a confrontational tone on Monday by dismissing his Foreign Affairs Minister and his protege. Hamutenya defended himself, saying he was fired on flimsy grounds and suggested that dirty tricks had been used to get him out of the race.  Shortly before the congress opens, some delegates talk about their fears and concerns. For others, the body language shows that their nerves are on edge. That same day, one of the delegates is reportedly admitted for psychiatric treatment after a nervous breakdown.  One delegate said the person from the Oshikoto Region was overwhelmed by the pressure of 'political elephants' fighting. Others say the breakdown may have been caused by party politics in the regions rather than the presidential race. In the hall by 18h00 - Many delegates try to disguise their jitters by singing and dancing to liberation music. Anti-colonial tunes, such as Mambulu djeimo moNamibia (Boers get out of Namibia) are still a potent rallying cry in the ruling party. Nujoma's restrained opening statement seems to soothe the anxiety of expectant delegates. Friday night passes without much fanfare.   D-Day  Delegates, adorned in Swapo colours - suits, scarves, beads and hats - return the next morning for the election.  They are locked in the meeting hall, and had yet to start voting by 13h00, as they listened to the candidates and their backers promoting themselves.  By then people had already caucused often and for a long time, and had agreed who to vote for, or agreed to disagree. Voting is over by 17h00. An hour later they are back in the hall, ostensibly to hear the results.  More songs:Olye ngoka ta ende kombanda yomeya? Hailwa Sema yaNujoma (Who's that walking on water? Comrade Sam Nujoma). Anxiety builds up. The hall falls silent when Bonny Haufiku takes the microphone. He is only looking for a lost ID. More tense moments for the candidates and their supporters, eyes to the desk in front and to the television screens.  20h35: Angula, Hamutenya and Pohamba give journalists a photo opportunity.  Waiting continues.  21h25: Elections director, acting Judge Petrus Damaseb, walks in.  21h35: Nujoma follows, his fist punching the air as the crowd sings Sema owu li peni? (Sam where are you?). He seems tense and nervous. Damaseb announces the first results. Delegates must vote again and reconvene at 03h00. The final results are out by 03h35.  Half an hour later, Nujoma looks at his watch when Tjiriange announces that celebrations will continue with the braai at Swapo headquarters.  There is no moon by then, but plenty of stars in the sky.  Celebrations continued through Sunday.  'Swapo is the winner,' says Swapo activist Willem Nathinge.

Police in Spain, Italy and the UK have been working around the clock to localize several cells of Ansar al Islam, some of whose members have already been identified, who intend to commit attacks against British and Italian targets during President Bush's trip to Europe, antiterrorist sources have informed La Razón. These groups are composed primarily of Algerian fundamentalists, although there are also some Moroccans, and they were trained in the camps of Afghanistan.  The alarm sounded in Europe upon the receipt of completely reliable information that several cells of Ansar al Islam, the terrorist group in the Al Qaeda network led by the Jordanian terrorist Mohammed al Zarkawi, is planning to commit large-scale attacks in Italy and the UK. The 'commandos' have operational and logistical support in Spain, where they may have obtained money and some of the false documentation they use. In theory, according to the sources, it is not believed that they are going to carry out attacks in Spain, although any scenario is possible, given the dangerous nature of the Islamists.  Current investigations are directed at localizing, as soon as possible, a group of Algerian extremists who are already in the UK and Italy to attempt to carry out attacks in the next few days, coinciding with the European tour that the leader of the US begins in Italy tomorrow. The police of these countries, with the close cooperation of the Spanish police, have managed to identify some of the terrorists, some of whom may be Moroccan.  These are experienced terrorists who, according to the sources, received their training in the Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, where they learned techniques for the manufacture and placement of explosives and highly destructive weapons.  In May, Judge Baltsar Garzón of the Audiencia Nacional sent three Algerians and one Spaniard to prison for their alleged connection with a terrorist group related to Al Qaeda, and he asked the UK to hand over the alleged head of the group, Heidi Ben Youssef Boudhiba, alias 'Fathi,' who is being held in [England] and who has been connected with the cell that attempted to carry out a ricin attack in London.

Speaking on the second day of the 14th annual World Economic Forum Africa Economic Summit in Maputo, Mozambique, Manuel noted that the South African Revenue Service (SARS) had done 'as much or more' than any institution to root out corruption within its ranks in recent years, having convicted 27 people for corruption in 2002 alone.   'Corruption is indeed a big issue,' he said. 'But we must also hit out at the corruptors as hard as those who take it--and it is imperative that the private and public sectors campaign together on the issue.'   He called for a 'big campaign' to blacklist those companies involved in issuing bribes in the Lesotho Highlands project, to ensure that they did not receive new contracts. Currently even the World Bank was avoiding Lesotho, he observed.   Manuel added that one of the biggest challenges was to make rules and salaries transparent and predictable.   'It is clear that one can't live off a government salary and it is clear that one must go after baksheesh to survive. It is a joint responsibility between the public and private sectors to ensure that salaries are adequate and fair, thus relieving the temptations of corruption.'   Approximately 550 leaders from all sectors of society are currently participating in the three-day WEF Summit, the first to be held in Mozambique. This year's theme is 'Engaging Business in Development'.

The military exercises are part of China's annual maneuvers involving large numbers of troops, ships, aircraft and missiles, and will take place on Dongshan Island. The island is located off the coast of Fujian province along the southern Chinese coast near Taiwan.   A U.S. intelligence official said the exercises will begin later this month.   'It isn't just a training exercise. It's also intended to send a political message [to Taiwan],' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  The official said the political message in the exercises is one of 'military readiness,' intended to signal to Taiwan that China is ready to use force if necessary to reunite the island with the mainland.   Past war games on Dongshan, which is used for amphibious assault exercises, have involved 30,000 to 100,000 troops and large numbers of warships, submarines and combat aircraft.   The maneuvers are set to begin as the governments of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) last week traded accusations that rival patrolling warplanes crossed the line dividing the Taiwan Strait into Chinese-and Taiwanese-controlled waters.   The government-owned Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, which first disclosed the exercises in a report published Monday, said that about 18,000 troops would participate and that the war games are practice for 'seizing control of the air over the Taiwan Strait.'   The exercises are expected to continue through July, the newspaper said.       China's communist government has expressed anger through press statements in recent weeks. China views plan by Taiwanese leader Chen Shui-bian for a referendum on updating the island's constitution in 2006 as a move toward formal independence, which Beijing opposes.   The Pentagon on Friday released an annual report on Chinese military power, which said Beijing is making strides at boosting its space defense capabilities.   The report provided information that the Chinese military is working on methods of space warfare against U.S. intelligence.  It was the first public warning by the Pentagon that the Chinese are considering ways of 'blinding' U.S. eyes in space before launching any attack on Taiwan.   The space-warfare elements of the report bolster the findings of a 1999 congressional commission led by Rep. Christopher Cox, California Republican, that said China is developing space weapons.

Speaking at International Renewable Energy Conference in Bonn, Schroeder said the world's dependency on oil was playing into the hands of terrorists.   Terror attacks on oil facilities 'are directly aimed at striking a vital nerve of humankind', the Chancellor told government representatives from more than 130 countries attending the Bonn conference.   The spate of recent attacks in Saudi Arabia and the continued instability in Iraq made it dramatically clear that the availability of a variety of sources of energy was vital to international security, Schroeder said.   He also noted that current high oil prices illustrated an urgent need to move away from oil and towards renewable resources like the sun, wind, hydropower and bio-energy.  The German leader's remarks came at the opening of a two-day ministerial session at the conference.   The conference, which began 1 June and is to end Friday, will issue an International Action Programme (IAP) for renewable energy projects and initiatives around the world.   Earlier Thursday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a video transmission to the Bonn proceedings, also said building up renewable energy would strengthen world security.

In his first visit to the British capital, Zapatero opened up the prospect of making progress on the controversial European Constitution. The former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar caused the earlier talks to stall over voting rights. Progress on details of the constitution and the question of who will succeed Romano Prodi as Commission president were expected to dominate the talks.  Blair said the two countries were working closely on European matters and that 'it is important we are good partners'. Despite major disagreements between Madrid and London on Iraq, the British prime minister insisted   relations between the two countries were 'just fine'. The decision of Zapatero to withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq caused a split between Spain and Britain. It is the latest in a series of meetings Zapatero is conducting with European leaders. He has also travelled to Italy, Germany, France and Portugal. But he has no plans to meet with President George W. Bush who arrives in Italy Thursday for a whistle-stop tour of Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day.

Kenneth Brill, the U.S. ambassador to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told reporters that Iran's refusal to fully cooperate with the agency 'fits a long-term pattern of denial and deception that can only be designed to mask Iran's military nuclear program.' An IAEA report released on Tuesday said agency inspectors had found more traces in Iran of highly enriched uranium that could be weapons-grade. The IAEA also reported that Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian purposes, has admitted to importing parts for sophisticated P-2 centrifuges for enriching uranium, going back on claims that it had made the parts domestically.  'Almost two years after the IAEA became aware of Iran's covert nuclear program, and fully one year after the discovery of Iran's attempts to conceal their work at the Kalaye Electric Company [in Tehran], delayed access, inconsistent stories and unanswered questions continue to be the hallmark of Iranian cooperation with the agency,' Mr. Brill said. 'Even a disinterested observer must now ask, what is it that the Iranians are so intent on hiding?' Mr. Brill asked. The IAEA report is to be submitted to the agency's 35-nation board of governors on June 14. The United States has called for the IAEA, which has been investigating the Iranian program since February 2003, to refer the Islamic republic to the U.N. Security Council for possible international sanctions. In Tehran, top nuclear negotiator Hassan Rowhani said yesterday that Iran had 'no secret nuclear activities.' Mr. Rowhani said: 'Iran's nuclear dossier is on the way to being sorted out and there is nothing very important that is pending.' But Mr. Brill said: 'Iran is still stalling, providing last-minute declarations and contradicting earlier definitive statements. The IAEA continues to find new, incriminating evidence of undeclared activity. ... 'The question is how long the [IAEA] board of governors and the international community will tolerate this,' he said. Diplomats and experts said they expected nothing to happen in the short term because Washington does not have a 'smoking gun' to prove Iran is making nuclear weapons. 'The United States is stymied unless the IAEA can come up with some devastating revelation that Iran is lying or hiding something,' said Gary Samore, a London-based nonproliferation expert. He said the Iranians may even be emboldened with their success in putting off the IAEA to resume the enrichment of uranium, something they voluntarily suspended in order to build confidence with the international community. A Western diplomat close to the IAEA said such a move by Iran 'would spark a crisis with [Britain, France and Germany] and others and I don't think that's a price Tehran wants to pay.' Highly enriched uranium can be used for fuel in reactors but also the explosive in atomic bombs. Another diplomat said nothing less than the international non-proliferation regime was at stake in Iran. The diplomat said getting to the bottom of the Iranian program was 'difficult but crucial for nonproliferation and for the IAEA.' 'If progress is slow, there will come a time when the Europeans will have to reflect on their policy,' the diplomat said.

That covert money network, based in the tax havens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Panama and Nassau, helped bankroll the war machines of both Iraq and al-Qaida.    More than 1,000 pages of confidential corporate, bank and legal documents show how the network functioned. The papers come from court cases filed in several European countries, from corporate records, from investigations by Italian police, from a report of the Kroll international investigative agency, and from private sources. The documents are the basis of further investigations coordinated in Europe by the prosecutor of Milan.   They show, for example, that a father-and-son team in Liechtenstein, whose business is setting up shell companies and secret bank accounts, worked to move the money of both Saddam and al-Qaida. Engelbert Schreiber and his son Englebert Schreiber Jr. are listed as founder or board member of Mediterranean Enterprises Development Projects; Tradex; Techno Service Intl.; Saidomin; and Executive Flight Assistance, all Liechtenstein companies that handled arms sales and payoffs for Saddam. They are also listed on corporate documents for Nasreddin International Group Ltd Holding (Liechtenstein). Ahmed Idriss Nasreddin, on the U.S. terrorist blacklist, was a founder of Al Taqwa, the bank that moved money for al-Qaida and which was closed down by the United States after 9/11. The Schreibers declined to respond to numerous requests for comment.   One of the men linked in documents to several Panama shell companies used in the Saddam laundering network was Baudoin Dunand, a Swiss lawyer who is administrator of the Saudi Investment Company (SICO), the Geneva investment affiliate of the Bin Laden family conglomerate, run by Osama bin Laden's half-brother Yeslam Binladen. (They spell their names differently.) Mr. Dunand declined to respond to repeated requests for comment.   The Banca del Gottardo in Lugano, Switzerland, moved al-Qaida money via the Al Taqwa bank, a shell bank that operated through correspondent accounts at the Gottardo branch in Nassau. It also handled payments for the Saddam money network. The bank's spokesman wrote, 'Please be advised that we do not intend to make any comments or discuss any issues with you regarding the article you proposed in your e-mail.'  Banque Paribas, headquartered in Paris, with a significant portion of shares owned by Saddam's cousin Nadhmi Auchi, moved money for the Al-Mahdi network in the 1980s and was the bank chosen to handle the Iraqi oil-for-food payments. In fact, Iraq insisted that Paribas handle the oil-for-food escrow account. A corporate document for Al Taqwa Trade, Property and Industry Co. Ltd. of Liechtenstein -- an al-Qaida network shell company also shut down by the United States -- lists Banque Paribas, Lugano, where it had accounts. (Paribas in 2000 merged with another French bank to create BNP Paribas, with Auchi continuing as one of the largest shareholders.)  Saddam Hussein began constructing his offshore operation in 1968 in Switzerland, aware that the country's bank secrecy made it a prime place to organize the movement of illicit funds and the purchase of arms. That year, 11 years before his coup, Saddam sent his half-brother Barzan Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti to Geneva to construct the network to launder secret commissions charged on sales of Iraqi crude oil. The system would also be used for kickbacks on purchase from Western arms dealers. Liechtenstein, which Swiss bankers and money-managers often use to handle dubious clients, was used to ensure even more impenetrable secrecy: real names of company and account owners would be hidden from law enforcers.  The keys Iraqis in the operation were Said Rahim Hussein Al-Mahdi and Nadhmi Auchi. Al-Mahdi was sent to Lugano because his father-in-law, Talaak El Naboulsi, an Egyptian soldier and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, was then working in Geneva for Barzan. (Barzan is now in U.S. custody.)  Al-Mahdi set up his system of secret companies and accounts with the assistance of the prominent asset managers (also known as trustees or fiduciaries) Elio Borradori in Lugano in the southern, Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, and Enrico Walser and Engelbert Schreiber, in Vaduz, Lichtenstein. He would also use managers in Panama, and the Bahamas. The same jurisdictions would be used to launder money in the oil-for-food sales in the 1990s.  Al-Mahdi established MEDP (Mediterranean Enterprise for Development and Projects), registered in Lugano, with subsidiaries - generally just paper shells - in New York (MEDP USA at 900 Third Ave., New York, incorporated in 1984), London, Paris, Milan, Vienna, Tokyo, Seoul, and Sao Paolo. Nazir Auchi, Nadhmi’s brother, chaired its subsidiary in Baghdad. These shells in turn had shares of other companies that carried out the money laundering and arms purchases.  The offshore networks directed by the two men were crucial intermediaries for such weapons merchants as Messerschmitt-Bulkow-Blohm Helicopter and Military Aircraft Group /MBB (Germany), Thyssen Industries (Germany), Airbus (the consortium of French, German, Spanish and U.K companies), and Dassault (France), which used them to pay kickbacks and, after international embargos were established, to hide illegal sales.  For example, a 1982 bank transfer from the Nassau branch of the Banca del Gottardo in Lugano notes a credit to MEDP's 'Satan' account of 33,000,000 French francs (about $6 million) from Dassault International. On a trip to Paris in January 1985, Al-Mahdi signed a contract with Dassault International whereby the company was instructed to send payments to an account at the Indosuez Bank branch in Lugano.  Banca del Gottardo has a colorful history: it is the bank that moved the bribe and kickback money paid by a Swiss construction company to former Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his cronies in exchange for contracts to refurbish Kremlin buildings. In the 1970s, Gottardo was the Swiss subsidiary of Banco Ambrosiano, 'the Vatican bank,' which collapsed in 1982 in a $1-billion fraud that involved money siphoned off to offshore shell companies and accounts. Ambrosiano had laundered drug- and arms-trafficking money for the Italian and American mafias.  A 1983 document shows $1 million transferred from the Gottardo Satan account to Hamid Al-Tikriti's account at the National Bank of Kuwait. The recipient - Abid Hamid Mahmoud Al-Tikriti - was Saddam's presidential secretary and cousin, arrested by the United States in June 2003. In 1981, half a million dollars had been sent by Gottardo to Hamid Al-Tikriti's Kuwaiti bank account.  Some Satan payments went to individuals in the United States. A December 1982 telex from MEDP Paris requests a transfer of $200,000 from the Satan account to Jawdat T. Mansour and Rihad J. Mansour to their account at the 63rd (Street) and (El) Cajon (Blvd.) office of the San Diego Bank, 4690 63rd Street, San Diego, California.  Asked about the commission agreement, Dassault Vice-President Gerard David said by phone from Paris, 'We don't know anything about it. Our president wasn't president then. It was 20 years ago. The law in France is that every 10 years we destroy the archives. We have nothing to say. It's not an answer, but it's the truth.'  Al-Mahdi's network used Panama shell companies set up by Roger E. Watson, who had dual American-Panamanian citizenship. An official Panama document dated 1985 lists Watson as vice-president of a company called Radistal; the president was Giuseppe Poggioli, a Lugano financial consultant who acknowledged in e-mail that al-Mahdi was his client. Watson and Poggioli were also officers of another Panama shell company, Dumynta. Poggioli said about Watson, 'I think he was the Consul of Panama in Lugano, but I am not 100-percent sure. I have no more contact with him since 1986 or 1987.'  In 1985, Al-Mahdi was called back to Baghdad and imprisoned by Saddam, who suspected he was skimming funds, and he was beheaded in 1986. After Al-Mahdi's death, Saddam divided control of the network between the directors of the subsidiary companies of MEDP, Iraqi businessman Manhal Sheikh Kadir in London and the Lebanese Alfred Jawde in New York. Watson, who set up a residence in Como, Italy, replaced Borradori in 1987 as Saddam's financial consultant and managed Panama shell companies for the network via his L.R. European Company. Poggioli said that he, Poggioli, also left the operation. Kadir and Watson could not be located, and Jawde, sent the documents, declined to comment. Borradori was reached, but he is of advanced age and has difficulty communicating.   An Aug. 13, 1990 document signed by International Aircraft Leasing Ltd. And Erfel Anstalt, both shell companies registered in Liechtenstein, noted past 'consulting agreements' with Airbus Industries, Blagnac, France, March 7, 1985, and with MBB, Munich, Feb. 19 and March 18, 1985; and a contract with Thyssen Industries AG, Essen, West Germany, Nov. 26, 1987. An Erfel record of that date sets out commissions from MBB and Thyssen totaling SF 720,000 ($432,000).  The United Nations enacted comprehensive trade and weapons embargoes against Iraq in 1990. However, a 1991 Erfel document notes a $255,875 - 5 percent - commission from Airbus and a $45,247 - 5 percent – commission from Thyssen. And a 1991 balance sheet for IAL cites a debt of 1,455,000 German marks due to Thyssen Industries AG, Essen, with FF 3,812 earmarked for Kensington Anstalt, an Al-Mahdi shell company.   IAL prepared a chart that showed that from 1986 to 1991, it collected 'commissions' of $1,238,813 (Canadian) from MBB, $10,827,000 (U.S.) from Airbus, $3,900,000 (Canadian) from Thyssen, and DM 1,466,000 from Thyssen D.   Thyssen and Airbus, which now includes MBB, were sent the documents, but company officials declined to respond.   A confidential December 2001 report by Kroll, the international investigative agency, said that two Swiss companies, MEDP Corporation SA in Lugano and Midco Financial SA (in liquidation), were the holding companies that handled the money Saddam skimmed. It said, 'Whilst in Geneva, Barzan was believed to have participated in financial schemes that included in the year 2000 the illegal sales of Iraqi petrol' and the purchase of weapons.  The unpublished report, authenticated by Kroll board chairman Jules Kroll, was commissioned by Kuwait after the Gulf War in an attempt to locate Iraqi assets it could claim as compensation. Jules Kroll explained, 'In 1990 we were given the assignment and paid by the government of Kuwait.' He said the goals were to identify Iraq's procurement network and to find assets outside that would be used to fuel the regime and buy weapons. The 2001 report was an update of the 1991 report.'  Kroll investigators discovered that one of the middlemen helping Saddam was Marc Rich, the U.S. tax-evader pardoned by President Clinton. Rich had been indicted by the United States in 1983 on charges he evaded more than $48 million in taxes and illegally bought oil from Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis. He fled the United States and settled in Switzerland. Kroll said, 'We came up with evidence that through Marc Rich's Spanish subsidiary, he was using some Iranian cutouts - specifically Bakhtiar, Iranians, whose family was close to Saddam - he was using them to negotiate arrangements as it related to oil.'  'The work was all turned over to OFAC (the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control),' Kroll said. That means the Clinton administration knew about Rich's aid to Saddam.   The Kroll report also dealt with Nadhmi Auchi, reporting the Italian intelligence view that he was a 'high-level Iraqi defense procurement and intelligence agent.'   After Roger Watson in 1987 became Saddam's financial consultant, he also became an adviser to Auchi's International Company of Banking and Financial Participations (CIPAF). According to official Italian documents, Auchi used Panama to launder kickbacks for two contracts for the Iraqi military. An Italian parliamentary report in 1987 said that one of them, Dowal, set up by Watson, was used to collect $23 million in hidden commissions on Baghdad's purchase of warships manufactured by the Italian shipyard, Cantieri Navali Riuniti.   In another case, the Operation 'Clean Hands' (Mani Pulite) investigation in Italy revealed in 1993 that Auchi received about $40 million in hidden commissions to facilitate approval of a Franco-Italian engineering project to construct a pipeline from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. Italian banker Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia declared to investigators that he had received instructions to transfer these commissions to accounts in Panama established in the names of Iraqi officials.  Auchi's spokesman condemned any allegations of wrongdoing as 'outrageous.'  The totals from skimmed oil revenues and contract kickbacks from the late 1970s through the oil-for-food 90s have been estimated by U.S. officials to reach $30 or $40 billion.  Jules Kroll said that until 9/11, a few staff members at the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control 'were the only ones spending any energy on this issue in any organized way.' He said, 'The level of ignorance at the CIA was total, at the FBI it was beyond total. The law enforcement and intelligence community in the U.S. was behind the curve. It was of little interest to them,' he said.  Source;  by United Press International. Copyright 2004. All rights reserved.

"           NAMIBIA - SOCIAL AFFAIRS   Namibia On the Brink of a Serious Crisis   Namibia and the rest of southern Africa face one of the world's most serious humanitarian crises, a top United Nations official has warned.  Fresh from visits to Namibia, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland, James Morris, the UN Secretary General's special envoy for humanitarian needs in southern Africa, has warned of serious consequences if nothing is done to stem the crisis.  'The numbers of food-insecure and vulnerable households tell of an extraordinary human tragedy and southern Africa must still be considered the location of one of the world's most serious humanitarian crises,' Morris wrote in a report to the UN.  When he was in Namibia last month, Morris urged Namibia to play a greater role in combating the effects of HIV-AIDS and to offer improved access to services for the rapidly growing number of orphans and vulnerable women.  He said the Government needed to step up efforts to deal with the 'humanitarian crisis' in the country.  'I am particularly concerned about the plight of orphans and women and their inability to access critical necessities such as food, clean water, education, and health care,' he said.  Morris came to review how the international community could more effectively assist Namibia in battling HIV-AIDS, food security and the drain of human resources.  'An expedited implementation of commitments is required if Namibia is to get through this crisis without losing an entire generation,' said Morris.  Namibia ranks among the top five countries in the world most affected by HIV-AIDS. The virus has become the country's leading cause of mortality with nearly a quarter of a million people infected. Average life expectancy will decline to around 40 years of age by the end of 2005 - 25 per cent lower than without HIV. There are already more than 120 000 orphans and vulnerable children in Namibia and the number will reach 250 000 by the year 2020.   The World Food Programme, Unicef and the Namibian Government recently put together a joint appeal of US$5,8 million to help over 600 000 orphans and other vulnerable children and women suffering from the combined effects of erratic weather, severe poverty and worsening HIV-AIDS rates.  However, funding has been slow and this has had a serious effect on the UN's ability to adequately support the most vulnerable groups.   Source;  The Namibian (Windhoek).

The Computer Misuse and Crimes Bill enjoys strong backing from bankers and the Computer Society of Zambia, a group of professionals promoting computer use, who say hacking into dormant accounts has become a problem in this poor southern African country.   'We feel this law will help to deal with the increasing number of electronic frauds and hacking especially in the financial sector,' said Milner Makuni, president of the Computer Society of Zambia.   The most famous cyber offence in Zambia was committed by a young computer whizkid who hacked the State House website and replaced the picture of then president Frederick Chiluba with a cartoon.   He was arrested and charged with defamaing the head of state but the case failed to succeed because there was no law in Zambia which deals with cyber crimes.   'The bill, once passed, will help to deal with high tech cyber crimes that our current legal system cannot address,' said Bob Samakai, a ministry of communication permanent secretary.   But some cyber experts worry that the measure is likely to be abused by the authorities to curb access to the Internet.   'It is difficult to regulate the use of computers and Internet because we are dealing with a world wide web,' said Brenda Zulu, a renowned cyber journalist who specialises in online reporting.   She said the country should first develop a policy on Information Communication Technology (ICT) before rushing to enact legislation on computers.   Currently, the Zambian government is seeking public input in the draft ICT policy, which is yet to be adopted.   'This law is very vague and not necessary for Zambia at the moment,' said Lloyd Himambo, an editor of Zambia's online newspaper, The Watchdog.   He said regulating the use of computers will be a difficult undertaking and wondered how such a law will be enforced in Zambia, a country where computers are a preserve of the rich.   About 1 in 1,000 Zambians owns a computer, according to unofficial estimates.   The Computer Society of Zambia agrees that enforcing such a law will be difficult, but pledged to help train police officers to understand cyber crimes.   'I think what people should be fighting for is to upgrade their security features on their websites to deal with hacking but not to criminalise it,' said Zulu, adding that hacking a site can be done outside Zambia making it difficult to track the offenders.   A senior Zambian lawyer, who has studied the bill, said it is an 'import of the British Act' and lacks local input.   'I think this law is very advanced for the Zambian society and government should not rush it through parliament before reaching consensus,' he said, on condition of anonymity.   Source;  AFP.

Islamabad and Johannesburg - The two South Africans held in Pakistan by intelligence agents were caught with a top al-Qaeda operative after a fierce gunbattle at the weekend.   The operative, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, is of the world's most wanted men with a $25-million (about R157-million) price on his head.   He was in custody in Pakistan on Friday for his suspected role in the 1998 bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.  'It is a big achievement for our security forces'  On Thursday Pakistan's high commissioner in Pretoria, Akbar Zeb, expressed doubt that the two South African men being held captive on suspicion of terrorism activities were only tourists.  They had been granted visas on July 10 to visit Pakistan for 'tourism' purposes.  Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Aziz Pahad called Zeb in to insist that South Africa's high commission in Pakistan be given consular access to the men.  Zeb assured Pahad that the high commission in Islamabad would be given consular access to the two men 'very soon' - once his government's intelligence authorities had completed their initial investigations.  The two South African suspects, believed to be 20-year-old Islamic-studies student Zubair Ismail of Laudium and Feroz Ganchi, reported to be from Fordsburg, were arrested on Sunday along with Ghailani and 13 others.  He is wanted for the death of Americans  They were arrested in a house in the city of Gujrat after a 14-hour gunbattle. Police seized firearms, ammunition, grenades and maps.   But the families of the men in South Africa claim Ismail was in Pakistan to study while Ganchi, a doctor, was there for relief work.   Others said the men were on a hiking expedition.  Zeb dismissed speculation in the South African media that there had been a muddle over the men's identities or that the men arrested had stolen passports from Ganchi and Ismail.  According to Sapa, Pahad met the Ganchi family, at their request, on Wednesday to tell them what the government was doing.  'Ghailani and the others were arrested after the firefight in Gujrat, about 175km south-east of Islamabad, Pakistan Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat said.  'It is a big achievement for our security forces,' he said.  The US's $25-million reward for the capture of the Tanzanian national is the same bounty offered for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and 19 others on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Most Wanted Terrorist List.  Ghailani is probably the most senior al-Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan since the arrest in March 2003 of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.  'He is wanted for the death of Americans,' said an official in Washington on condition of anonymity.  Ghailani, who is in his early 30s and goes by the nicknames 'Foopie' and 'Ahmed the Tanzanian', was indicted in New York in 1998 for the synchronised blasts that blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing 224 people.  Washington blamed al-Qaeda for the devastating bombings and carried out a missile attack on Afghan military training camps run by Bin Laden shortly afterwards. Bin Laden escaped unhurt.  Four al-Qaeda supporters were sentenced to life in prison in October 2001 by a Manhattan federal judge for the bombings.  The FBI and the Manhattan US Attorney's office had no immediate comment on Ghailani's arrest.  Hayat said Pakistani security forces had been acting on a tip-off when they raided a suspected militant hideout in Gujrat. One policeman was slightly wounded in the gunbattle, he added.  Hayat said Ghailani, his Uzbek wife and up to eight other foreigners, including two South Africans, were among those arrested.   Those held included four men, three women and five children, Pakistan's Nation newspaper said today.   'They were strangers, and they acted as such, keeping mostly to themselves,' the newspaper said, quoting neighbours.  Pakistan had not yet received a request from the US for Ghailani's extradition, Hayat said.  'He has been in Pakistan for some time. We have to establish the exact nature of his activities and scope of his network in Pakistan.  'Only after we have exhausted our inquiries shall we be able to hand him over to the US.'  US Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage praised Pakistan's pursuit of al-Qaeda-linked fighters during a visit to Islamabad this month.  US officials suspect that Bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahri and other al-Qaeda supporters are hiding somewhere in rugged tribal areas along the Afghan border and have pressured Pakistan to pursue foreign militants in the lawless region.  Up to 600 fighters, including Arabs, Chechens and Uzbeks, are believed to be in the tribal belt, many of them sheltered by tribesmen who have also been involved in fierce clashes with Pakistani troops this year.  Pakistani forces launched two major operations this year in the region after President Pervez Musharraf vowed to clear the country of foreign militants accused of attacks in Pakistan, including two attempts on his life in December, and strikes on US-led forces in Afghanistan.  Pakistan says it has arrested hundreds of al-Qaeda fighters and handed them over to the US since it joined the US-led war on terror in the wake of September 11. - Reuters and Independent News Service.

Fox News, for one, reportedly was wildly trying to disguise its trucks by covering up its logos.  The effect of this probably was to make the press even more suspicious of anti-war demonstrators than it already is-to even view them as possible terrorists, and if not actual terrorists, then a crowd within which terrorists could operate.  All of this is taking place in an atmosphere of fear and tension whipped up by the Bush administration, with its reports of Al Qaeda 'sleeping cells' preparing to strike against America in the midst of the presidential campaign. (See my July 16 article on a chilling Election Day scenario.)  The white supremacists on the far right have never shown any great interest in the war on terror, and they usually try to use the press, not attack it. Mark Potok, editor of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Report, which tracks the far right, told Glynn Wilson of the serious-minded Southerner Daily News blog, 'We have had no indication whatsoever, not an inkling, that there is any kind of violent action planned by the radical right in Boston. We follow these groups quite closely.'  ABC News said last week (basing its report on anonymous sources) that, just before the convention opened on July 23, statements by a domestic group of college-age people in the Midwest triggered the FBI warning, according to Wilson. The ABC report said the group's members had not gone to Boston, Wilson noted. Other warnings of 'a very real concern' about impending 'violent action by white supremacists' emanated from the Secret Service, the Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force, and Boston police, Wilson said.  CNN reported July 23 that 'authorities fear that some protesters are preparing to target the media' and that the 'Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating.' According to the CNN story, the FBI's Boston office issued a statement saying it had 'unconfirmed information' that, as CNN put it, 'a domestic group plans to attack media vehicles, possibly with 'explosives or incendiary devices.' '  Special Agent Gail A. Marcinkiewicz, the public affairs coordinator for the Boston FBI office, told the Southerner that the report of a 'radical domestic terrorist group' planning an attack on media trucks in Boston was 'unconfirmed.'  Wilson noted that Boston authorities, according to ABC, were worried about two right-wing white supremacist groups in particular: Volksfront and White Revolution. Potok told Wilson that some members of Volksfront pleaded guilty last year in the beating death of a homeless black man, and the Volksfront online bulletin board recently carried a posting urging members to go to Boston and 'rally.'  'But there was no suggestion whatsoever of any violence,' Potok told Wilson, 'let alone violence against media trucks. . . . I find it extremely difficult to believe that White Revolution or Volksfront would be involved in an action like this.'  Overall, the racist far-right would just love to get some publicity from the war on terror, but these people are stuck in the Stone Age when it comes to weaponry and ideas, and they are definitely not into suicide bombings. Such groups have always tried to manipulate the press, not attack it-except for such rare cases as the neo-Nazis' murder of Denver talk-radio host Alan Berg in 1984.  Source;  Mondo Boston.

Church officials told reporters that Bishop Vacca, of the city of Yopal, was found safe in a small town northeast of Bogotá, the capital. Rebels of the Liberation Army, which was for years led by a Spanish priest, had said they planned to release him with a message to give to the government.

The guns and the bullets are then transported to various parts of the country including Nairobi by donkey carts, trucks and, sometimes, government vehicles.  The research, which is a campaign against small arms by Oxfam - a British development and charitable organisation - says that the weapons come from Ethiopia, which borders Kenya to the North and Somalia which borders Kenya to the East. Others come from Uganda and the volatile Democratic Republic of Congo.  The weapons are picked at the Manyatta Burji-Moyale in Ethiopia. Most of these are normally destined for markets in Eastleigh and Kariobangi North estates in Nairobi, the study, done early this year, says.  Most of this thriving business goes on under the noses of border officials who either look the other way or are too ignorant to know what goes on.  In Mandera, the source of the ammunition and guns is the Suftu area of Ethiopia and Gedo region of Somalia. The entry point is Suftu, Mandera/Somalia border and several other secret routes. The weapons are ferried using donkeys, human couriers and lorries. Most of these find markets in Wajir, Isiolo, Meru, Marsabit and, occasionally, West Pokot.   Unlike in Moyale, ammunition sale in Mandera is done more discreetly. The sale, most of the time, takes place in the middle of the night as opposed to Moyale where business is transacted throughout the day.  The source of ammunition that comes through Wajir is Lower Juba region, Kismayu and Mogadishu  The main entry point is Diff, and through numerous cut lines paved during the oil exploration in the mid 1980s.   The mode of transport is lorries that ferry uncustomed goods from Somalia and human couriers.  Most of the ammunition from Somalia that comes through Mandera is readily gobbled up by Mandera, southern Moyale, eastern part of Marsabit and Wajir north.   In Isiolo, the source of the arms is the Oromo Liberation Front rebels. Others come from Wajir due to the differences between the Ajuran and Degodia community, and also from Kenya Police through the regular and Kenya Police Reservists (homeguards).   The entry points are Merti, Garba Tulla, Modogashe and Habaswein.  In Garissa, the source of the weapons is Somalia, especially the Upper Shabelle and Lower Juba.  The traffickers get in through Diff, Liboi and Daadab and carry their deadly cargo by bus and lorries. Others are disguised as livestock traders.   Most of these arms find their way into Ijara, Tana River, Ukambani and Nairobi.  West Pokot gets its arms from the Democratic Republic of Congo and also Karamojong in Uganda.   The guns, which are used in cattle rustling, enter Pokot through Kacheliba, Alale and Turkwel. A brand new AK-47, the Oxfam report says, can go for as little as Sh10,000 while a bullet can go for even Sh50.  In Samburu, gunrunners get their products from West Pokot, Isiolo, Turkana, Uganda and Sudan.  They come through Nyahururu, Barsaloi, Baragoi, South Horr, Ngurunit and Archer's Post and find a ready market in Maralal, Barsaloi and Baragoi.   The string of world-class tourist hotels and lodges that dot the banks of Ewaso Ng'iro in Samburu district is a clear testimony that development can flourish in the arid and semi-arid areas. Interestingly, these investments are never attacked despite being in a bandit-prone area.  A member of the Moyale Peace and Reconciliation Committee says that the government's indifference and vast and porous Ethiopian border largely contribute to the spread of small arms in district.  In Moyale this 'business' is monopolised by women and truck loaders who transport it to Nairobi concealed as jerry cans carrying old engine oil. Every other day a convoy of nine lorries depart from Moyale carrying an estimated 560 rounds of ammunition.   'I can afford to buy food for my children and that is the basic thing I should provide for them. The rest, like going to school, are luxuries I can't afford to give to them. I don't beg and neither does my husband rob other people,' says Marre Hirbo, 38, speaking of her bullet business.   She carries them disguised in a bag of maize seeds and crosses the border nonchalantly in the morning.  She normally picks them from her younger sister's house, a few metres from Moyale-Ethiopia's police headquarters, sandwiched between a mosque and the Ethiopian military barracks.  On the Kenyan side at Manyatta Burji village where her house is, somebody is waiting on the tail of a convoy travelling to Nairobi. Marre buys a jerry can and half fills it with engine oil where her 60 ammunition are dipped, then hidden in the back of a truck for the long journey to Nairobi.  She justifies her trade again: 'The government has failed to develop Moyale, what are we expected to do?'  There are more than 16 police roadblocks from Moyale to Nairobi during the day and twice the number at night. Yet the bullets arrive in Nairobi unnoticed.   In Wajir, an intelligence officer monitoring terrorism and other related activities confided that as long as the cut-lines paved during the exploration of oil in the mid-1980's are there, it will be a gigantic task to stop the small arms trade in Wajir and Garissa besides the act of terror itself.  The officer says the region is sitting on a time bomb, adding that there are many illegal activities based on local and cross-border politics as well as others of economic dimension controlled from Somalia going on and can easily be missed by a undiscerning eye.   'Every transaction here is so intricate that it needs a trained eye, a lot of patience and intensive networking to understand and uncover,' he adds.  Those who sell their animals to livestock markets in Garba-Tulla, Merti, Modogashe and Sericho transport arms. A bullet normally costs Sh100, says the report.   The guns and ammo are used to protect the animals while on transit to market centres. Once they reach the market, the guns and ammo are sold at the same time the animals are disposed of.  'We have to pay school fees and other needs during the dry season when the prices of our livestock are at the lowest. So once in a while we sell them out of the stock that we keep for emergency,' says Aden, a former school teacher.   The proximity of Wajir to Somalia, the little presence of the government and the vastness of the area has made trade in small arms and ammunition so lucrative that it offers alternative employment to local youths.  The proliferation of arms in the area is also attributed to suspicions and conflicts among the four clans that inhabit the district. Each clan controls a constituency.  The story of Garissa will never be complete without mentioning one of the most bloody conflicts in the entire province between the Ogaden/Auhlian and the Abdalla clans of the then greater Garissa before its split into Garissa and Ijara districts.   Two former senior government officials incited leaders of their respective clans to take up arms in what started as a fight over resource control but ended up as territorial battle. Ijara became a district as a result of the bloody war that claimed the lives of many of the 'midwives' involved in its birth. Hundreds of arms and thousands of rounds of ammunition were bought from Somalia to the greater Garissa district.  The embers of these clan differences still smoulder, sometimes fanned by the winds from resource pressure, drought and land. However, after the 1997 General Election, there was a lull on the battlefront and peace took root thanks to the Pastoralists Peace and Development Initiative and the posting of Mr Mohammed Saleh, who comes from the region, as Provincial Commissioner. But this initiative was cut short after the transfer of the PC in 2002. Trafficking in ammunition seems to have been reactivated.   Isiolo is in the middle of Kenya. Its position is therefore of strategic importance. Due to its terrain and proximity and easy and fast access to major urban areas, Isiolo is a dream of every military commander. Its weather is ideal for desert warfare. The open spaces are best for the infantry and artillery.  Its seasonal rivers and sandy nature are the most important training ranges for the tanks and combat engineers and the British Army brings its troops for training there too, hence the town is surrounded by four military institutions namely School of Infantry (SOI), School of Combat Engineering near Archer's Post, the 78th Armoured Brigade and the 75th Artillery Battalion based at School of Artillery.   The Isiolo/Moyale Highway is one of the major arteries in the road network systems whose notoriety as a conduit for small arms and ammunition trade is well known to the authorities.  Isiolo is also a rendezvous for arms dealers, traders, travellers and livestock traders from the northern region except Turkana and Tana River. Its location in the heart of Kenya, therefore, is of significant strategic importance.  Ewaso Ng'iro traverses four provinces as it flows and drains into Lorian Swamp in North Eastern Province. The river, which forms one of Kenya's largest basins, is the lifeline of the agriculturists in the upper catchment, the wildlife and tourism in the middle and the pastoralists in the lower area.  These combined factors attract other pastoralists who bring their livestock to Isiolo and hence much pressure is put on the land leading to conflicts. For this reason, many of these pastoralists buy arms to protect themselves or to raid others.   A G3 in Isiolo goes for Sh30,000 while an AK-47 sells at Sh20,000. Bullets from police officers after an operation go for between Sh30-60 but when there is no operation they costs Sh100. They are also sold further afield to the Samburu in Wamba, Archer's Post, Serolipi, the Rendilles of Marille and Laisamis and Turkanas of Baragoi transported by lorries that ferry goods to Marsabit on the Nairobi/Addis Highway.   In 1997, Isiolo was a battle front between the Degodia clan from Wajir West and the Borans after the Degodia, who had come in search of water and pasture for the livestock most of which had been wiped out by a prolonged drought. However, they extended their welcome and the Borans were not amused. The Degodias were armed and so for the Borans to tackle them, they sought weapons from the Ethiopian cousins in the Oromo Liberation Front. A war erupted killing many.   In Samburu East constituency, the British Army had pitched camp and its Artillery and Infantry units practise three times in a year at the Laresoro range a few kilometres outside the sleepy town of Archer's Post.  'The guns in Samburu came from North Eastern Province. The Samburus bought them from the Somalis after we came under attack from several neighbouring tribes,' says Sammy Leshore, Samburu East MP.  The chairman of the Samburu Peace Committee, Mr S. Lenairoshi also says people buy bullets from policemen and homeguards. In Alale sub-district of West Pokot the weapons are bought from Uganda - they just walk across the border and back without any hindrance.  In 2003 alone, more than 32,000 people were displaced in Kerio Valley and areas bordering West Pokot due to banditry and cattle rustling activities, recalls Oxfam.   Source;  The Nation (Nairobi).

About two years ago, I visited the US airbase in Bagram, some thirty miles north of the Afghan capital Kabul. A US Army public affairs officer, a friendly Texan, gave me a tour of the sprawling camp, set up after the ouster of the Taliban in December 2001. It was a clear day, and one Chinook helicopter after the other took off to transport combat troops into the nearby mountains. As we walked past the endless rows of tents and men in desert camouflage uniforms, I spotted a wooden pole carrying two makeshift street signs. They read 'Exxon Street' and 'Petro Boulevard”. Slightly embarrassed, the PA officer explained, 'This is the fuel handlers' workplace. The signs are obviously a joke, a sort of irony.' As I am sure it was. It just seemed an uncanny sight as I was researching the potential links between the 'war on terror' and US oil interests in Central Asia.    Strategic struggle for Wild East   I had already traveled thousands of miles from the Caucasus peaks across the Caspian Sea and the Central Asian plains all the way down to the Afghan Hindu Kush. On that journey I met with and interviewed warlords, diplomats, politicians, generals, and oil bosses. They are all players in a geo-strategic struggle that has become increasingly intertwined with the war on terror: the 'New Great Game'. In this re-run of the first 'Great Game,' the nineteenth-century imperial rivalry between the British Empire and czarist Russia, powerful players once again position themselves to control the heart of the Eurasian landmass, left in a post-Soviet power vacuum. Today the US has taken over the leading role from the British. Along with the ever-present Russians, new regional powers such as China, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan have entered the arena, and transnational oil corporations are also pursuing their own interests in a brash, Wild East style. Since 11 September 2001, the Bush Administration has undertaken a massive military buildup in Central Asia, deploying thousands of US troops, not only in Afghanistan but also in the republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia. These first US combat troops on former Soviet territory have dramatically altered the geo-strategic power equations in the region, with Washington trying to seal the Cold War victory against Russia, contain Chinese influence, and tighten the noose around Iran.    Oil giants covet Caspian riches   Most importantly, however, the Bush Administration is using the 'war on terror' to further US energy interests in Central Asia. The bad news is that this dramatic geopolitical gamble involving thuggish dictators and corrupt Saudi oil sheiks is likely to produce only more terrorists, jeopardizing US prospects of victory. The main spoils in today's Great Game are the Caspian energy reserves, principally oil and gas. On its shores, and at the bottom of the Caspian Sea, lie the world's biggest untapped fossil fuel resources. Estimates range from 85 to 190 billion barrels of crude, worth up to US$5 trillion. According the US Energy Department, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan alone could sit on more than 130 billion barrels, more than three times the US reserves. Oil giants such as ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, and British Petroleum have already invested more than US$30 billion in new production facilities. The aggressive US pursuit of oil interests in the Caspian did not start with the Bush Administration, but under Clinton who personally conducted oil and pipeline diplomacy with Caspian leaders. US industry leaders were impressed. 'I cannot think of a time when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian,' declared Dick Cheney in 1998 in a speech to oil industrialists in Washington. Cheney was then still CEO of the oil-services giant Halliburton. In May 2001 Cheney, now US Vice President, recommended in the Administration's seminal National Energy Policy report that 'the President make energy security a priority of our trade and foreign policy,' singling out the Caspian Basin as a 'rapidly growing new area of supply.'    Chemical dependency   Keen to outdo Clinton's oil record, the Bush Administration took the new Great Game into its second round. With potential oil production of up to 4.7 million barrels per day by 2010, the Caspian region has become crucial to the US policy of 'diversifying energy supply”. The other major supplier is the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, where both the Clinton and the Bush administrations have vigorously developed US oil interests and strengthened ties with corrupt West African regimes. The strategy of supply diversification is designed to wean the US off its dependence on the Arab-dominated OPEC cartel, which has been using its near-monopoly position as leverage against industrialized countries. As global oil consumption keeps surging and many oil wells outside the Middle East are nearing depletion, OPEC is in the long run going to expand its share of the world market even further. At the same time, the US will have to import more than two-thirds of its total energy needs by 2010, mostly from the volatile Middle East. Many people in Washington are particularly uncomfortable with the growing turmoil in Saudi Arabia, whose terror ties have been exposed since the 11 September 2001 terror attacks. As the recent bombings and attacks on oil installations have shown, there is a growing risk that radical Islamist groups could topple the corrupt Saud dynasty, only to then stop the flow of oil to 'infidels.' The consequences of 8 million barrels of oil - 10 per cent of global production - disappearing from the world markets overnight would be disastrous. Even without any such anti-Western revolution, the Saudi petrol is already, as it were, ideologically contaminated. To supply the ideological deficit left by lack of democracy, the Saudi ruling elite relies on the fundamentalist Wahhabi version of Islam - many of whose preachers see no room for compromise with nations like the US.    Tapping new veins   To escape its Faustian pact with Saudi Arabia, the US has tried to reduce its dependence on Saudi oil sheiks by seeking to secure access to the fabulous oil and gas resources in the Gulf of Guinea and the Caspian. Central Asia, however, is no less volatile than the Middle East, and oil politics are only making matters worse: Fierce conflicts have broken out over pipeline routes from the landlocked Caspian region to high-sea ports. Russia, still regarding itself as imperial overlord of its former colonies, promotes pipeline routes across its territory, notably Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. China, whose dependence on imported oil increases with its rapid industrialization, wants to build eastbound pipelines from Kazakhstan. Iran is offering its pipeline network for exports via the Persian Gulf. By contrast, both the Clinton and Bush administrations have championed two pipelines that would avoid both Russia and Iran. One of them, first planned by the US oil company Unocal in the mid-1990s, would run from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to the Pakistani port of Gwadar on the Indian Ocean. Several months after the US-led overthrow of the Taliban regime Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a former Unocal adviser, signed a treaty with Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf and the Turkmen dictator Saparmurat Niazov to authorize construction of a US$3.2 billion gas pipeline through the Herat-Kandahar corridor in Afghanistan, with a projected capacity of about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas per year. A feasibility study is under way, and a parallel pipeline for oil is also planned for a later stage. So far, however, continuing warlordism in Afghanistan has prevented any private investor from coming forward. Construction has already begun on a gigantic, $3.8 billion oil pipeline from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku via neighboring Georgia to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. British Petroleum Amoco, its main operator, has invested billions in oil-rich Azerbaijan and can count on firm political support from the Bush Administration, which stationed about 500 elite troops in war-torn Georgia in May 2002.    Pipeline perpetuates instability   Controversial for environmental and social reasons, as it is unlikely to alleviate poverty in the notoriously corrupt transit countries, the pipeline project also perpetuates instability in the South Caucasus. With thousands of Russian troops still stationed in Georgia and Armenia, Moscow has for years sought to deter Western pipeline investors by fomenting bloody ethnic conflicts near the pipeline route, in the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjaria. Washington's Great Game opponents in Moscow and Beijing resent the dramatically growing US influence in their strategic backyard. Worried that the US presence might encourage internal unrest in its predominantly Muslim Central Asian province of Xingjian, China has recently held joint military exercises with Kyrgyzstan. The Russian government initially tolerated the US intrusion into its former empire, hoping Washington would in turn ignore Russian atrocities in Chechnya. However, for the Kremlin, the much-hyped 'new strategic partnership' against terror between the Kremlin and the White House has always been little more than a tactical and temporary marriage of convenience to allow Russia's battered economy to recover with the help of capital from Western companies. It is unthinkable for the majority of the Russian establishment to permanently cede its hegemonic claims on Central Asia. Russia's Defense Ministry has repeatedly demanded that the US pull out of Russia's backyard within two years. Significantly, President Putin has signed new security pacts with the Central Asian rulers and last October personally opened a new Russian military base in Kyrgyzstan. It is the first base Moscow has set up outside Russia's borders since the end of the cold war. Equipped with fighter jets, it lies only thirty-five miles away from the US airbase.    Strange bedfellows   Besides raising the specter of interstate conflict, the Bush Administration's energy imperialism jeopardizes the few successes in the war on terror. That is because the resentment US policies cause in Central Asia makes it easier for al Qaida-like organizations to recruit new fighters. They hate the US because in its search for antiterrorist allies in the new Great Game, the Bush Administration has wooed some of the region's most brutal autocrats, including Azerbaijan's Heidar Aliev, Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbaev and Pakistan's Musharraf. The most tyrannical of Washington's new allies is Islam Karimov, the former Stalinist dictator of Uzbekistan who allowed US troops to set up a large and permanent military base on Uzbek soil during the Afghan campaign in late 2001. Ever since, the Bush Administration has turned a blind eye to the Karimov regime's brutal suppression of opposition and Islamic groups. 'Such people must be shot in the head. If necessary, I will shoot them myself,' Karimov once famously told his rubber-stamp parliament. Although the US State Department acknowledges that Uzbek security forces use 'torture as a routine investigation technique,' Washington in 2002 gave the Karimov regime US$500 million in aid and rent payments for the US airbase in Khanabad. Though Uzbek Muslims can be arrested simply for wearing a long beard, the State Department also quietly removed Uzbekistan from its annual list of countries where freedom of religion is under threat. Even though the US this year held back US$18 million in aid, Powell assured Karimov he was still in their good books. 'Uzbekistan is an important partner of the United States in the war on terror and we have many shared strategic goals. This decision does not mean that either our interests in the region or our desire for continued cooperation with Uzbekistan has changed,' the State Department said. The current US policy of aiding Central Asian tyrants for the sake of oil politics repeats the very same mistakes that gave rise to bin Ladenism in the 1980s and 1990s because their disgusted subjects increasingly embrace militant Islam and virulent anti-Americanism. Tellingly, Uzbekistan has recently seen a sharp increase in terrorist activities, with several bomb attacks shaking Tashkent in April, including the first-ever suicide bombings in Central Asia. More than forty people died in gun battles between the terrorists and security forces.    Alternatives to fossil fuels needed   The 11 September attacks have shown that the US government can no longer afford to be indifferent toward how badly dictators in the Middle East and Central Asia treat their people, as long as they keep the oil flowing. So, while the war on terror may not be all about oil, certainly in one sense it should be about just that. A bold policy to reduce the addiction to oil would be a wise strategy to win the epic struggle against terrorism. In the short term, this means saving energy through more efficient technologies, necessary anyway to slow the greenhouse effect and global warming. The Bush Administration's old-style energy policies of yet more fossil-fuel production and waste are continuing in the wrong direction. It is time to realize that more gas-guzzling Hummers on US highways only lead to more Humvees (and US soldiers) near oilfields. What is urgently needed instead - for security reasons - is a sustainable alternative energy policy. Ultimately, no matter how cleverly the US plays its cards in the New Great Game in Central Asia and no matter how many military forces are deployed to protect oilfields and pipelines, the oil infrastructure might prove too vulnerable to terrorist attacks to guarantee a stable supply anyway. The Caspian region may be the next big gas station but, as in the Middle East, there are already a lot of men running around throwing matches.  Write; by Yuumei.

I’m a bad ass, and I pull no punches!  I.  Introduction  A quick note before we get started with the first chapter.  My dad is going to retire this summer, and my mother is in the process of sending me many of my high school and before memories.  I was something of a packrat in my younger years, so I got stuff like old notes from family and old girl friends, etc.  Have you ever read notes from old girlfriends?  My daughter will not be allowed to date until she is 25.  One thing that I got, I had completely forgotten about, and I think you may like this story.  As I was going through my box of memories (and wishing I was young again), I stumbled upon a picture holder from an old wallet.  It didn’t have but a couple of things in it, but one of the pictures sent me to the floor with laughter.  In that plastic picture holder was an autographed photo of Richard Nixon!  It was actually a picture that I had cut out of a magazine and autographed myself.  A flood of memories filled my head.  I remember laughing to myself as I cut the picture of ‘ol Dick taking a swing at a golf ball.  I would show it to my friends and proclaim that Dick’s not such a bad dude, he did open up China and all.  Want to make some of your fellow liberal friends mad, just carry around a picture of Nixon.  I looked at the picture again and just smiled.  When I cut this picture out, I was just beginning to walk down the path of adulthood.  I was cocky, and confused at the fact that I knew more than my parents did about life!  I was also beginning to form my opinions about my country and my political ideology.  I would have never thought that in my college years, I would be a leftist, and as I grew and matured even further, I would swing 180 degrees to the right.  Go figure.  I’m going to frame the picture.  It may just be a bad black and white of “Tricky Dick”, but to me it represents a beginning: a beginning of a total political dork, but a beginning none the less.  As you read on, and you think I’m getting to deep or you think I sound like I’ve been smoking crack, think of Nixon (WWND) !  He would want it that way.    Enjoy…  When I was in college, I knew better than most of Americans.  I was a liberal History/Political Science major.  I believed in affirmative action, welfare, etc.  I would go on and on about how these causes where noble and how anyone that didn’t believe the way I did was either wrong or just plain stupid.  I voted for Anne Richards (Democratic Governor of Texas), and I even took place in some political activities at school.  Not many but some.  I was the typical academia liberal.  I was intellectually superior, and my ideas (even though they where not rooted in research or fact) where superior to those right wing thick headed cavemen.  I mean really.  Who was going to stick up for the little guy?  Big business?  Hell no.  The rich?  Let’s hear a real big, Hell no.  The only people that would stick up for these poor folks where people like me.  Arrogant college students that knew more than my parents ever would.  I knew darn well that the right wing would not care.  All they cared about was screwing the little guy and trying to pay fewer taxes.  My PolySci buddies and I would sit in class and discuss how much the world sucked and how could people go on with their lives while so many people where in need.  Around my senior year(s), I think, I began to grow up.  I remember being in the library at Stephen F. Austin State University.  I was reading a book that had been written by an Indian (or Native American, whatever) who had taken the term black power and started an Indian rights group in the 1960’s called “Red Power” (I can’t remember the book, sorry, and I’m not going to waste my time trying to find it).  As I was sitting in my cube, just having woken up from a nap, I began reading a chapter about how he was bitter about the left wing specifically Democrats in government.  “What?” I thought to myself.  “What is this guy thinking???  If it wasn’t for the left wing, the Indians would be on their own without any help from the government!!  Lord knows that they would not be able to take care of themselves!!!”  I had to put the book down for a moment.  I pushed back my chair and began to think hard about the beginning of this chapter.  I had only read the accusation not his reasons, but in my mind how could an Indian (a minority for God’s sake.  Okay okay okay, A NATIVE AMERICAN) make such accusations!  I mean the left, I’m sure, had worked so hard to make sure they where taken care of and protected from the right after they had stolen their land, raped their women, killed their buffalo and destroyed their way of life!  I looked around the floor and for a moment watched dozens of fellow students reading, sleeping and studying in groups speaking in whispered tones.  I guessed that no one else had read the book, or they would be putting a hand on my shoulder and say “Don’t worry dude, they just don’t get it.”  I read on…  The premise about this accusation was the fact that yes it was nice for the offer of help, and it was appreciated; however, when the money came, with it came liberals telling them how to spend it.  To put it in a nut shell, he went on to discuss how Indians where treated like children.  How could they grow as a people if they constantly had people telling them what to do and how to spend their hand-outs.  They would rather go without the hand-outs and determine their own destiny than have a group of outsiders telling them what to do.  These outsiders (liberals) would have no idea about the issues the tribe was confronting, but had preconceived notions about the reservations and Native Americans and that is what they dictated.  It was at that moment that I had a thought of total clarity:  “Maybe I’m wrong?”  “Am I a (oh God) a right winger?”  Whoa let’s take one step at a time.  That chapter in that book made so much sense to me.  I began to re-evaluate my political thinking over the course of several months.  I remember thinking to myself Reagan was a good President, and my professors thought he was the anti-Christ.  I also began thinking about things like welfare and other social programs, and my mind started to slowly change.  “Why did we need the government to do all these things?”  I began to ask myself.  Then the big life changing event – I had to leave the comforting bosom of academia and go get a job.    I worked as a waiter for the first nine months out of the gate.  Basically, it was college North.  Remember this was 1992 and the economy sucked,; the worst in 50 years according to some.  Plus in a liberal fashion, I had no plan for after graduation.  Finally, I began working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car as a manager trainee.  I remember getting my first paycheck in the mail and being so excited!  Then there was an “oh sh—“ when I opened the envelope that had my pay check in it.  Standing in the PO Boxes of my apartment I was stunned.  So stunned in fact, I remember dropping the envelope that my paycheck came in.   “Boy, they take a lot out for taxes.  What is this FICA crap?”  That was the final straw.  My political though began to mature to the right.  I can understand paying my fair share, but this was a bunch of s---.  What am I?  The wealthiest 1%??????  I actually started to open my mind and think.  Listen to what the politicians where saying and more importantly what they where doing.  I began to listen to the news media and how they where slanting stories.  I moved from a protected nilly willy in college to a working American that started to realize that freedom is more important than socialism.  Freedom works.  That is what has made our country so successful!  Over the last several years, I have kept up with my political junkieism. I love to participate in our political system.  I love the debate.  Election night is one of my favorite nights of the year (except 1992 and 1996, but I did like 1994!).  I have shaped my political idealism over this time.  I look back at my college years with some nostalgia.  I mean I did have a great time drinking beer with my fraternity brothers and keeping the debate (as wrong as I was) alive.  Not to mention the chicks!  This is why I’m sitting here at my, well my company’s, lap top right now.  Currently, our country is at war in Iraq.  Being the political junkie that I am, I’ve been watching/listening to the war what seems like 24/7, and I began thinking about all these self important actors and musicians that are protesting not to mention the professional protesters that are screwing up the infrastructures of our major cities.  I keep thinking about my college days when I was always right regardless of the evidence.  Furthermore, I watch these politicians from the left spout out, in my humble opinion, radically un-American rhetoric.    I began thinking about the left.  What makes a person a leftist?  How can an educated person think that way???  I’ve seen the light, why can’t everyone?  But being a right winger, I must respect their freedom to be wrong.  Anyway, that’s why I’m writing this.  To give you an idea of the different types of leftists (think of them as the genus: Liberal  Species: listed below) and how they have evolved, their value system and political thoughts.    This is a very subjective and completely un-scientific analysis of the left.  This is my humble opinion of these groups.  If you are looking for researched or first hand knowledge read any other book that has been written by a professional writer whose job it is to write books.  If book ever sees the light of day, and you buy lots of copies, I promise I will put a lot more time into research for the next book.  I’m writing this in my spare time (and even some time that I can’t spare), so what you see is what you get!  This is simply meant to be some light reading about our buddies on the left.  It should also help you get a better idea about their thought process and keep you from yelling at your TV, radio or newspaper although you will still even when you begin to understand them.  I have broken down the Genus – Liberal into several Species’ including:    •Academia •Actors, Athletes, etc. •Politicians •60’s Activists •Gen X •Corporate •Unions  •Minorities(African American’s) •Tree Huggers  •Animal Lovers •Homosexuals •Hippies •The Average Leftist Citizen •The Yellow Dog •Radical Leftist  •The French     It is very important that you don’t just use a blanket when discussing our buddies to the left.  Each separate Species has their own agenda and value system.  Now, you have to be careful.  Some of these Species have agendas and values that blend over to each other, but be rest assured these are all very distinct groups.  The common thread is the Genus which I call liberal.  That is kind of a misguided term.  I have been torn as to what to call the Genus.  I thought about “leftist”, “left leaning”, “socialist”, but I think liberal is a good generic term; however, these terms will be interchangeable as we go along (it depends what mood I’m in as I’m writing).    Understanding the Genus liberal is just as important as understanding the wide variety of Species.  I will also be covering this common thread in Chapter II.  Think of this as re-visiting your high school biology class when you had to scientifically describe the specimens that you where assigned by your teacher (who was probably in a union and cared more about trying to avoid testing than teaching) to review.  Think of it as a game.  You could even get some of your right leaning buddies and try and figure out the Species of your friends and famous people.  You may be surprised as you read along who fits where.  Finally, I want to give you some tips on how to handle these folks.  There are some simple tips to help you argue and understand them, so when you read chapter III, look at more as the “rule book” for you to use.  Keep in mind the left usually changes the rules as you go, but more on that later.  I hope you enjoy the rest of this.  I’m writing this before I write the rest of the book.  I don’t know how it is going to turn out (or even if I’m going to finish it!).    II. Genus – Liberal  Okay, let’s talk about the generalities of liberals.  I think the first and foremost thing that you need to know about liberals it this:  They hate you.  Don’t fool yourself.  If you are a right winger, you are stupid, homophobic, racist and are intolerant of anything that does not fit into your radical religiously inspired attitude about life.  You hate the poor.  You hate minorities.  You are also to dumb to realized the peace and prosperity of the Clinton years.  Finally, you are rich.  Now, you may be saying to yourself, “boy Jack, that’s kind of harsh.  I’m not rich, and I believe in freedom.  That belief system keeps me from labeling people.”  Sorry dude, you’re evil.  Your ideas are from Satin herself (well, if God can be female – tit for tat).  The Liberal thinks of you as a cartoon character.  You can see it in all aspects of the media and these idiots when they describe the people on the right.  Here are a couple of the left’s attempt to make people that don’t agree with them look like buffoos:  The Big Southern Dummy:  If you have never noticed the left hates the South.  They have a perception that the south is 1950 Alabama.  I don’t want to get all historical on you, but I have a theory (hmmmm, next book material?): I think this hatred comes from the Civil War.  Let’s take the slavery issue out of it for a minute.  One of the main issue around the Civil War was “States Rights”.  The South believed in a small Federal Government while the North believed in a strong Federal Government.  It is the issue that we have been debating since the founding of our republic.  When the North won the war, the South was devastated economically and socially.  I keep thinking of an old saying “The victor’s write the history”  The North made the South look like a bunch of slave beating crazies that married their cousins.    The little problem with that stereo type of the typical Southerner is that it isn’t true.  The South has gone through great changes in the past 100 years.  Today, the South is as strong if not stronger than the North economically.  The South is growing in population while the North is shrinking, but look how Southerners are portrayed.  The TV show in the early 80’s Dallas is a great example.  The Dallas/Fort Worth area (where I live by the way) is one of the top 5 largest population centers in the United States, but when you watch that show, it looked like a bunch of country bumkins that found oil on their land.  Much like the Beverly Hillbillies.  Hey, I think it’s great.  Let ‘em keep thinking that.  All it will do is keep the Republican’s in power.    Hand Wringing Religious Nut:  This plays into the stereo type of the Southerner, but is also applies to the heartland too.  They look at the lower middle class that is religious as a thorn in their side.  That is why they so vehemently try to keep God out of schools.  With no morals, you make a much better liberal.  I’m always amazed at the glee the liberal will have when they find out that a person that has religion screws up.  As President Bush says, “We are all sinners”  A true Christian realizes that no one is perfect, but we must strive to be the best that we can be.  The liberal on the other hand will take the phrase “Let he who casts the first stone have no sin” to a new level.  In the liberal’s world this means that you can’t criticize anyone for doing anything wrong, and if you do, be prepared.  You will have every second of your past looked into to try and prove that you are a hypocrite.  That is exactly why they try to portray the religious leaders in this world as snake handling crazies.  Think about it.  Even though you are an adult, you want to be accepted.  If you are thought of as a crazy because of your beliefs, you will do one of two things:  1.  Hide it.  and 2.  Boldly try and set the record straight.  Which they will in turn make you look even crazier.  The “I hate the poor” Business Executive:  This one always cracks me up.  They look at everyone that works for corporations (that aren’t part of a union) and thinks they are evil.  Chances are you or someone you know works for a large company.  Think of them when I’m describing how the liberal wants you or your friend to be portrayed.  They think of this person as a cigar smoking overweight person that wears expensive suits and plots the demise of the working class family while gazing upon the picture of his dearly departed grandfather that was in the SS, and he wonders what it would be like to have it so good.  See, the left hates business.  They see big business as trying to screw everyone.  The funny thing about it is they love Starbuck’s coffee.  They will get their copies made at Kinko’s while snacking on Ben and Jerry’s ice cream.  Typical hypocrisy of the left.  Just look it like this.  The typical Volvo driving liberal hates big business as long as it doesn’t inconvenience them, but they will go out of their way to portray them as a bunch of Nazi’s that are bent on killing the planet and enslaving the population.  The Poor Average American that is Duped by the Right’s Mind Control:  This is the average American that tends to not just fall into lock step with the liberal thought control machine.  The liberals hate them because they haven’t yet lost the ability to think for themselves; hence, they must have been taken over by the evil Republican machine.  Now, let’s look at this in perspective.  The news media is controlled by the left.  Hollywood is controlled by the left.  Billions of dollars are spent on news and entertainment is slanted to the left.  I guess I can see how the left would be confused by the fact that the AM radio dial has “brainwashed” so many Americans.   Those are the main three, but don’t worry the left is continually trying to come up with new stereo types to give the right a hard time every day.  Now that you see the left likes to pigeon hole you, I can let you in on the secret why the left hates you so much:  The main problem that you have is you have a belief system.  Be it religious, family values, or simply believing in the Constitution and the rule of law.  See, the left as we know it today is rooted in the 60’s political radicals (who where rooted in FDR more later).  They questioned EVERYTHING.  Hence their “belief system” is no belief system.  Listen to all these musicians and actors wax nostalgic about how they where going to change the world.  Remember the Time cover (I think it was Time) “Is God is Dead?”  If you spend your adult life with throwing away the traditional belief system that had been cultivating for the last 200 years, and you think that everyone that chooses to maintain that belief system is an idiot, you may just be a little bitter too or at lease not steeped in reality.  It makes you even more bitter because you lost (see 1994 Congressional elections and 2000 Presidential elections or Rush Limbaugh or any of a myriad of political talk shows and state/local elections) in the arena of ideas.  Now you are sitting around and you are thinking to yourself that you put the majority of your life trying to change the world into your leftist vision, and you realize that the majority of the American people don’t think the same way you do.  It infuriates the masses don’t see life the way you do – America sucks, right wingers are evil and the military is a bunch of baby killing barbarians!!!    Left wingers will never understand the right for the simple fact that they only hang around other leftists.  Rush has commented on this, and so have many other sources as well.  Here is the jest:  Since the liberal hates the conservative, why would they hang out?  Since they don’t hang out together, the liberal tells his peers how great their ideas are and how they can’t understand why America is going to hell in a hand basket.  How could Bush even come close to being elected?  When everyone I meet at cocktail parties (where we smoke cigars, but you better not smoke a cigarette) voted for Gore?  Another reason that liberals don’t hang around conservatives is they are sore losers.  When the Democrats where in power in the late 60’s and 70’s the Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate would “hang” together (i.e. go to lunch stuff like that)It was nice to have those funny little Republicans spout out about smaller government when they had no say.  Now that they are in the minority, they don’t want to “hang” with those jerks that took power from them!  They would rather plot the demise of the Republicans than get to know them.  Hence, they plot their own demise (which is kind of Oedipus funny if you ask me) because they can’t adapt with the changing times and the overall tone in America.  The Democrats are really pissed that 9-11 happened.  Not for the reasons you are, but because they where starting to see some success beating up on Bush.  Now, he is wildly popular and there is almost nothing they can do about it.   Now keep in mind that people that don’t have the same value system as you do will sometimes try to turn yours around onto you.  Don’t be fooled.  More in Chapter III.  Now that we know they hate us, let’s take a look at some of the common themes you will find with the left:  FDR was God:  There where some before him, but they never really got a foot hold onto the main stream.  FDR enacted the majority of the social programs that are blowing up today.  Social Security, welfare and a wide variety of agencies that have a three letter name.  FRD’s vision was that the Federal Government would be able to help the country out of the depression.  Well, he was wrong.  It took a little attack on our Navy in Hawaii and a war to pull us out, but we where left with the crap that was left behind.    I might be a right winger, but Harry Truman was one of my favorite Presidents.  In reading his biography I remember that he was amazed how un-organized the government was when FRD died.  Here is a valuable lesson about the left – throw a bunch of crap against the wall and see what sticks.  Let the someone else work it out.  Back to my point.  FDR was the root of the 60’s radicals.  Logically, he proved that liberalism doesn’t work, but he is a hero to the left.  I challenge you to find a liberal that will say anything negative about FDR.  I always thought he was one of our best presidents until I began to look at his record.  To say the least, he was a great leader in the early days of the war, but other than that he was not as great as our buddies on the left say he is.  Additionally, he gave a roadmap for two of the bullets in the 60’s radicals arsenal:  1. If they don’t agree with you, change it (see Supreme Court) and 2. Use the courts to change things if Congress won’t.  Today, the left has mastered this.  Why do you think they are fighting Bush’s nominations so much.  Typically, FDR plays a more prominent role for the leftist political groups vs. the, say, tree huggers of the left, but be rest assured he is the foundation for the left’s belief system.  “My viewpoint is right”  I get so enraged when I have a discussion with a leftist.  It is expected that if they make a good point that I concede the point, but if I show that they are wrong, I’m an asshole.    Don’t be discouraged, it is simply a part of life like the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.    The best defense is not to get your feathers ruffled.  If you know you are right and they give you a ration to the point where you can’t stand it anymore, just agree to dis-agree and post their stupid view point on Free Republic.  The USA Sucks.  It varies how we suck.  We ruin the environment.  We exploit poorer countries.  We screw the poor at home and abroad.  It will vary based on the Species, but the theme is common.  The United States somehow is the root of all the problems in the world.    Now, you may be saying to yourself, “Well, let them leave if they don’t like it”  See you are missing the point.  The USA Sucks because you are here.  See how many of these will root back to the hatred of the right.  They don’t hate the country.  In fact, they love it just as long as you are gone.  See, the right doesn’t care about the environment, they hate other countries and the poor should be taken out and shot.  Hey, don’t get your feelings hurt, that is just the way it is.  As far as the left is concerned, the USA is the evil place because of the right.   When you watch the news or listen to anyone that has their face in front of a microphone, listen carefully to what they are saying.  As I said, I’m writing this during the Iraq war.  Some of the questions that are being asked of the President among other Republican leaders are often about how could we be doing this when we are killing so many civilians.    I was watching ABC news the other morning when I was getting ready for work and was absolutely disgusted when I was watching Katie Curric interviewing a General that was in charge of an air base here in the states.  They where getting ready to ship out to the Middle East.  Several basic “how and why” questions where asked, then it came.  Flashed up on the screen was a shot of dead kids and she asked the General “How does it make you feel when you hear of the death of innocent civilians in Iraq?”  I had to do a double take.  Hey you idiot, this poor guy isn’t even over there.  At that point, I decided that ABC news lost a viewer forever.  I would rather watch CNN!    The Military Sucks -  The military is a completely different issue than the country.  The left despises the military.  I’m sure you have heard the “they are our planes now” comment on Rush Limbaugh several times.  As I was driving to the air port tonight, the radio was talking about an asst. professor at Columbia University (3-26-03) said he wanted us to lose the Iraq war and hoped for a hundred more Mogadishu’s.  See, they think the military is the true source of all evil in the world.  Much of that comes from the people that demonstrated the Viet Nam war in the 60’s and 70’s.  They basically held them in contempt.  I can almost hearing the protestors now “I’m dodging the draft, how can they honor their commitment?”  See, it goes back to questioning authority and thinking you are superior to everyone.  The military doesn’t fit.  Furthermore, the leftist believes that we should be able to resolve our conflicts with words.  Look, we may be the enlighten ones, but there are several countries that hate us (usually for the same reason as the liberals do).  We need to have the ability to defend ourselves.  Sorry, I’m probably preaching to the choir.  Basically, the hatred of the military comes from the fact that they hate the country, and want us to get our butts kicked.  Geeks in High School   This is just a personal observation about our buddies on the left.  I see most of them (especially the acting community) as the people that got their butts kicked when they where in High School.  I think that is why they are always preaching political correctness.  It’s not like I was the most popular guy in high school, but I didn’t let it shape my life.  High school was a time in my life that I spend growing into an adult.  Unfortunately, many of the actors in Hollywood didn’t bother to attend college, and their world view was shaped by their experiences in high school.  I’m not saying that you have to go to college to have an educated world view.  I work for one of the smartest people I know, and he never went to college, but he also was able to grow up.  I’m simply saying that it seems that a lot of left leaning folks ended up with some serious emotional scars sometime in their lives (I assume high school).  How do you think we ended up with political correctness?  Don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.  Heaven forbid someone lose at a sport.  Don’t you think Johnny would feel better about himself if we told him that it is okay to think that 2+2 is 5.  Well, 2+2 may equal 5 on the bizarro world.  In reality, 2+2=4 and I don’t think our children would die if they found that out.  How warped do you have to be to get so offended by a simple comment?  They are always wringing their hands when free speech centers around a nudie bar or throwing crap on a picture of Jesus, but you want to see a riot?  Say that you think it is silly for a guy to dress like a girl (or what ever).  “Well, that’s not free speech that is hate”  Last time I checked, free speech meant you could say what you wanted to.  The only catch is no one had to listen.  Here is an example:  I’m watching TV a few nights ago, and they had a EMINIM album thing on VH1.  About half way through they showed all the protesters whining about how his songs promoted hate waaaaa waaaa waaaa (writers note:  I’m sorry, but this stuff really gets under my collar)  I’ve got a question, where were all these groups when Ice T came out with Cop Killer?  They where defending that as “free speech”, but you hurt their feelings, watch out.  Once again (which could be a common theme thru out this book) they show what kind of hypocrites they are.  Like I said.  Listen to what they have to say.  Several Species in the liberal world got their butts kicked in high school.  Next time you watch CNN and listen to Paul Begalla, listen… “please don’t kick my butt, sir” may be the underlying theme of his arguments.  (Writers note:  well, well, well, it looks like our friends at Crossfire lost their time slot.  Paul and James, I’m sorry to see that you weren’t embraced by your viewers)  Negative Rarely Positive  One thing that is very common throughout the entire leftist movement is they never see anything positive.  From poverty to hunger to racism it is never the strides that people have made.  “We need to do more”, etc.  Well, if any of my left leaning brothers are reading this here is a little news flash, there will always be hunger, poverty and racism in the world.  I’m sorry to say, but we can no more solve the worlds problems in a week than we can take over the world as the left thinks the right wants to do.    I’m always struck on how negative the liberals can be.  If I have to hear how bad things are here in America one more time, I will not be responsible for my actions (of course, if you are liberal when are you responsible for your actions).  I’m an optimist by nature, so when bad things happen to me, I always see the light at the end of the tunnel.  The liberal simply sees an oppressed worker that is digging through the mountain that will never get ahead in life because of the oppression of “The Man”.  How they get through life thinking like that is beyond me.  I’m sure you’ve heard some of the code phrases.  “How can you be so happy when there is so much suffering in the world.”  “Eat all your food, there are starving kids in Ethiopia”  This is just a personal observation.  I’m one guy.  I make a middle class wage, and I’m trying to raise two kids.  I know that there is oppression and starvation all over the world, but I also know my limitations.  I don’t let myself suffer because of something that I have absolutely no control over.  Yes, I will have an opinion, but I don’t lose sleep over the fact that Chechnya’s civil unrest is causing global warming.  As I say, listen to what is said.  They are really just trying to make you feel guilty.  Do they propose to solve the problem with personally taken action?  No, they want to complain about how bad it is.  “Let’s tax the rich and Bill Clinton will fix it.”  Emotional Buttons A major component of the left’s argument is emotion.  Really, how can you be against clean air and water?  Do you really think Bambi should be shot?  Don’t you think we should have peace and love thru out the world?  Don’t those sound good?  Here one to think about:  •The Founding Fathers never envisioned assault weapons, we need gun control.  Well, I bet the Founding Fathers never envisioned XXX movie theatres either, but you will defend their right to be under free speech!  The left has become very good at wrapping their issues around emotions.  Think of the war the we are currently involved in.  One of the main arguments has been that our children should not go over there to die in this war.  Where were all these folks when we sent troops over to Kosovo?  Well, the difference was who was in office.  See, if our kids go over to die for a fellow leftist it is okay.  The cause must be just.  Here is a dirty little secret (well it’s not that secret) We invaded Kosovo without UN approval (gasp) If you remember it was a NATO gig.  See, the current problems we are having with the anti-war movement is not necessarily the policy, but who is making the policy.  Lip Service to Other Species One thing that has always amazed me about all the Species of liberal is their ability to circle the wagons when times get tough.  See for them it is far worse for the right to have any little victory v. giving up on their specific agenda.  For example:  If Nixon was a Democrat, the party line would have been, “Look, hotel rooms get broken into all the time.  Nothing of note was taken.” Or “Dirty tricks have been a part of politics from the Adams and Jefferson Presidencies.  So they took some papers, it didn’t help the campaign.  What is the big deal?”  See, it isn’t all about sex.  It is more basic than that.  Clinton would have had to walk up to a member of the press corps. and kicked him in the nuts for them to say it was wrong.  I would also guarantee you that there would be some on the left that would argue that he has every right as an American to kick that guy in the nuts.  It all ties back to the basic premise that they hate the right.  It doesn’t matter if you have to make a deal with the devil.  Take a look at the Democratic party and their factions (what we call Species here).  Do you really think that the labor unions give a flip about whether the yellow bellied swallow gets to live in its natural habitat?  Heck no.  Do you really think that the Gay / Lesbian crowd really cares that Buba in local 231 gets his $.02 raise to cover the cost of cigarettes.  Heck no.  It almost becomes a fun game.  Listening to the various groups and how they would react in other liberal circles.  An actor in a steel mill, a liberal anti-business college professor working with the CEO of Loral, you could spend some good quality time thinking of wacky side by side’s.    So, you right winger, you should feel proud.  If it wasn’t for us, the political landscape of America would be like Isreal with hundreds of little parties.  The left views you as their common enemy (for even wider reasons), and they will continue to hug and kiss and say it was just about sex as long as we are around.  Control As I say several times.  Listen.  You can hear what they are trying to say under the BS.  All you have to do is open up your ears.  There are more things that hold our buddies on the left in common, but I think this is one of the most prolific.  The left wants to tell you what to do.  Let’s look at a couple of examples that will help make this a little clearer.  Cigarettes are evil today.  We are fast getting to the point where we won’t be able to smoke in our own homes if it is Tuesday before an election because the nicotine could affect your vote.  I mean it is ridiculous.  Last time we checked we where adults here.  Everyone know smoking is bad, then why is it they are taxing the crap out of cigarettes to try and get you not to buy them?  Two reasons: 1. They know that you won’t complain about the taxes (classic sin tax) and 2. They are trying to control you socially.  They just passed a law here in Dallas that is basically a smoking ban in all restaurants.  Isn’t it the prerogative of the store owner to proclaim in he/she would like to allow smoking in their establishment?  Think about it for a minute.  If non-smoking facilities made more money for the owners, don’t you think EVERYONE would be switching to non-smoking?  Well, since it isn’t the government is telling us what we should do.  One of my favorite examples is seat belts.  Yes they save lives.  I don’t dispute that, but it should be my decision if I wear it or not.  I’m not forced to wear a life jacket if I go out on the water, so why am I forced to wear a seatbelt?  Because the liberals are trying to protect us from ourselves.  We are not grown up enough to decide for ourselves whether or not to wear a seat belt.  I can get a ticket for going 20 mph through a school zone without my seatbelt on, but a motorcyclist won’t get a ticket for going the speed limit on the freeway without a helmet (at least here in Texas).  Okay let’s try and figure out the logic of that?  Furthermore, here is a real head scratcher.  Most liberals support assisted suicide saying it is the choice of the patient, but they won’t let me smoke a cigarette and I’ve got to wear my seatbelt?    Liberalism is not about the little guy anymore, it is a movement that feels they need to protect us from ourselves, and what better group of people than them?  The rich in the Democratic party don’t want to have their taxes cut because they have enough money.  Well, you don’t tax money that is in the bank.  They already have it, so they aren’t affected.  I could go on about taxes but here is another example of the controlling attitude.  I got such a kick out of all the gay groups that had such a cow about EMINIM.  Hate speech, bla, bla, bla.  See, if you say anything negative about one of the Species groups of the left, you are evil, hateful, whatever.  You never see the outrage when people make fun of the Libertarians.  Those wacky far right wingers want to get rid of the IRS?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  What a bunch of dopes.  Look at how the religious folks on my side are portrayed?  They are cartoons, but if you treated an African American like that, Jesse Jackson would be knocking on your door with thousands of his paid protesters.  To put it in a nutshell, they are trying to change the very way we think.  Make us think that it is better to let 3 states burn up because it is bad to cut down trees.  Brainwash us into thinking that eating meat is barbaric.  All of this control centers around Big Government.  I get tickled about the left trying to compare the right to the book by George Orwell, 1984.  In their world, 1984 is a dream.  Control of the people to make sure we are all equally miserable is the ultimate goal of the left.  In the right v left chapter, we will discuss this further, but I think it is imperative to touch on this many times.  The left is happy with a government that is growing and slowly taking over aspects of our lives to make sure we are “safe, etc”.  The right is working hard to keep with the vision of our founding fathers.  Limited government and to give all Americans the opportunity to move up by their boot straps  Don’t fall for it.  Keep your mind free.  I hope you now have an idea who we are dealing with here.  Don’t forget that these are the common threads that hold the left particularly the Democratic Party together.  For any movement to be a movement they have to have a commonality.  Their particular agendas may vary, but the base is generally the same.  I would be amazed to see a liberal pronounce that the government should not tell us to do this that or the other.  You will never see a leftist proclaim that the middle and upper class is being overburdened with taxes.  I may have overlooked some commonalities.  If I did, let me know!  I love hearing from like thinkers.  Now that we have the base built, let’s move onto the specifics of these Species.  We will be discussing several Species on the left.  As in this chapter, there will be some common threads that pull them together, but there are some very large differences between the groups.  Don’t be fooled by the rhetoric from the left.  “Our party is about diversity!  That is why we have so many different groups that are a part of the movement”  That is basically a bunch of crap!  They are diverse as long as you hold the common themes listed above to be gospel.",4.791,5.759,5.705,0.51,0.52,77.732,13.233,0.082,0.815,0.103,7.759,9.13,4.168,2
